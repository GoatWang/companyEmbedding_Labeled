Sergey Soldatenkov, Chief Executive Officer of MegaFon, commented on the financial and operational results as follows:
MegaFon's performance in 2016 was in line with our guidance for the year despite the difficult competitive environment in the Russian telecoms industry. The increasing pressures from tough competition caused us to reduce prices for services, while at the same time to increase spending on acquisition and retention of subscribers as well as network development.
 
The financial performance of MegaFon in Q4 2016 and the full year completely reflected the market situation; our consolidated revenue, amounting to RUB 316 billion, was essentially flat y-o-y, the growth in data revenue slowed, and our adjusted OIBDA margin declined to 38.3%, although the increases in revenue from equipment sales and wireline services were bright spots for the year.
 
In this uncertain environment we undertook a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening our current position and anticipating eventual improvement in our business. Given the fact that mobile penetration in Russia is now approximately 180%, we have decided that it would be inappropriate to continue aggressively building our subscriber base. Instead, we will focus more on improving the quality of customer care and delivering value in order to maintain the loyalty of our existing subscribers. At the same time we will continue to develop our value-added services in order to monetize mobile data and increase our revenues from this source.
 
The proposal to acquire a controlling stake in the Mail.Ru Group was the signature event of last year.  This step will enable us to transform our business and evolve from a mobile operator into an integrated digital communications company. It will give us an opportunity to develop, together with Mail.Ru, brand new products and services for our customers, which will combine mobile data and digital technology capabilities and open a new chapter in the history of both MegaFon and the entire telecom market in Russia.  We are pleased to report that the transaction, which was completed in early February of this year, received overwhelming support from our shareholders.
 
We are also in the final stages of defining our strategy for the next three to five years, which we hope to announce at the end of May. 
 
Our key priority remains to ensure the continued attractiveness of our shares to investors. In October 2016, the Board recommended, and the shareholders approved, an additional dividend for 2016 in the amount of RUB 15 billion. When combined with the dividend approved in June 2016, the total amount of dividends distributed in 2016 amounted to RUB 50 billion, which is in line with the 2015 amount.

Revenue
Our total consolidated revenue for 2016 increased by 0.9% y-o-y and reached RUB 316,275 million, fully in line with our guidance, while our consolidated revenue for Q4 2016 decreased by 0.8% y-o-y to RUB 81,287 million. 
Russian revenue for Q4 2016 and the full year 2016 remained the major component, accounting for over 98.6% and 98.5%, respectively, of total consolidated revenue.
Our wireless revenue decreased in Q4 2016 by 3.8% y-o-y to RUB 65,871 million, and in the full year 2016 by 2.4% y-o-y to RUB 263,645 million, in each case reflecting the continued stagnation of traditional voice services due to a shift to digital technologies and growing popularity of alternative Over the Top services as well as the increased penetration of bundled offerings.
However, a significant increase in revenue from handsets and equipment together with the positive performance of our wireline service revenue throughout the year served to offset this decline in our wireless revenue. 
The increasing number of subscribers choosing bundled tariffs (which generally are more economical for subscribers because they have higher data allowances) also served to slow the growth rate of mobile data revenue, which increased in Q4 2016 by only 1.9% y-o-y to RUB 21,732 million and in the full year 2016 by 5.7% y-o-y to RUB 84,441 million. At the same time, the share of data revenue in total consolidated revenue increased in Q4 2016 from 25.6% to 26.3% and in the full year 2016 from 25.5% to 26.7%. An increase in revenue from value-added services in Q4 2016 of 4.9% y-o-y and of 5.2% for the full year 2016, on the back of further development of MegaFon's popular services, including MegaFon TV and the MegaFon card, partially compensated for the decline in wireless revenue.
Wireline service revenue for the full year 2016 increased by 9.5% y-o-y to RUB 25,661 million due to continued expansion of our B2B and B2G client base and development of our portfolio of products. However, because the comparable Q4 2015 results included the effects of certain one-off contracts and the acquisition of GARS, wireline service revenue in Q4 2016 increased by only 0.8% y-o-y to RUB 6,988 million.
Revenue from sales of equipment and accessories for Q4 2016 increased by 28.4% y-o-y to RUB 8,428 million, and for the full year 2016 increased by 35.5% y-o-y to RUB 26,969 million, as a result of the demand for more expensive high-end devices which we marketed with attractive bundled offerings. The average price of phones sold in MegaFon retail stores in Q4 2016 increased by 85% y-o-y to RUB 4,323.
 
Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA Margin
In Q4 2016 our adjusted OIBDA decreased by 1.6% y-o-y to RUB 29,053 million mainly due to a 5.1% increase in the cost of revenue, resulting from the higher sales of equipment and accessories noted above and higher rent expenses, which was partially off-set by an 11.5% reduction in employee benefit costs due to the revision of bonus accruals and related social charges, a RUB 450 million decrease in radio frequencies fees, and a 5.4% decrease in sales and marketing expenses. Adjusted OIBDA margin in Q4 2016 decreased by 0.3 p.p. y-o-y to 35.7% compared to 36.0% in Q4 2015.
Overall, adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2016 was RUB 121,139 million and exceeded the targets announced in our revised guidance. Adjusted OIBDA margin for the full year 2016 decreased by 3.9 p.p. y-o-y to 38.3% from 42.2% in 2015.
 
Net Profit
Consolidated net profit in Q4 2016 decreased by 42.3% y-o-y to RUB 3,079 million mainly due to an impairment charge in the amount of RUB 3,400 million relating to the goodwill allocated to the Broadband internet cash generating unit, which reflected the rapid decline in returns in the retail broadband segment and revisions in management forecasts in this segment in response to the current challenging economic environment and competitive pressures.
Net profit for the full year 2016 decreased by 34.7% y-o-y to RUB 25,496 million due to a higher cost of services as a result of a shift in our revenue structure towards wireline services and sales of equipment and accessories which are traditionally lower margin segments; higher dealer commissions resulting from the increase in the number of subscribers; increased depreciation and rent expenses resulting from continued expansion of our network as well as inflation; and higher office rent costs.
 
CAPEX 
CAPEX in Q4 2016 increased by 13.1% y-o-y to RUB 26,715 million as compared to RUB 23,627 million in Q4 2015. We continue to maintain a significant level of investment in order to roll out our high speed mobile data network coverage across our existing network footprint as well as upgrading our 2G and 3G networks. CAPEX for the full year 2016 reached RUB 65,577, 6.5% lower than the capex number for 2015, which included the cost of the purchase of spectrum from SMARTS in Volga region.
 
Free Cash Flow
Our free cash flow for Q4 2016 increased by 2.1% y-o-y, from RUB 13,836 million for Q4 2015 to RUB 14,121 million for Q4 2016, mainly due to the fact that there were higher cash capital expenditures in Q4 2015.
Free cash flow for the full year 2016 decreased by 12.8% y-o-y to RUB 46,927 million mainly due to a RUB 10,319 million, or 9.1% y-o-y, reduction in operating cash flow.
 
Net Debt
Our net debt increased from RUB 190,207 million as of 30 September 2016 to RUB 196,856 million as of 31 December 2016, principally as a result of the dividend payment made in December 2016.  We continue to pay close attention to our leverage situation and to ensure that we maintain an optimal capital structure.
 
Earnings per Share
Consolidated basic and diluted EPS in Q4 2016 decreased y-o-y from RUB 10 per share to RUB 5 per share, and consolidated basic and diluted EPS for the full year 2016 decreased y-o-y from RUB 66 per share to RUB 43 per share, in each case in line with the decrease in net profit.
 
Outlook/Guidance
We expect MegaFon's revenue for 2017 to grow in the flat to low single digit range and anticipate that our OIBDA will be in the range of RUB 112 - 118 billion. We project MegaFon's capital expenditures for 2017 to be in the range of RUB 55 - 60 billion. 
This guidance represents stand-alone numbers and does not include the financial results of Mail.Ru. This guidance also does not take into account strategic advantages from the Mail.Ru transaction.
As recently disclosed by Mail.Ru, Mail.Ru's stand-alone revenue for 2017, on a pro-forma basis, is expected to grow 16-19% to between RUB 49.6 and 50.9 billion and its OIBDA margin to be around 42% for the full year 2017.

Our Russian wireless subscriber base increased by 1.1% y-o-y to 75.6 million as of 31 December 2016 as a result of attractive tariff offerings and options. However, we are shifting our focus from gross additions to retention of our existing customer base and increasing their life-time value9.
Our data service user base increased by 5.8% y-o-y, due to ongoing promotion of MegaFon data services and increased adoption of data-enabled devices (57.2% of all devices registered on the MegaFon network are now data-enabled devices). Our data users currently represent 41.0% of the overall subscriber base.

ARPDU in Q4 2016 decreased by 4.2% y-o-y to RUB 228 mainly due to a continued slowdown in mobile data revenue growth resulting from an increasing number of subscribers choosing cheaper bundled tariffs with higher data allowances which were introduced by MegaFon in early 2016. ARPDU in the full year 2016 decreased by 1.3% y-o-y, reflecting this same trend.
DSU in Q4 2016 increased by 1,423 megabytes, or 39.1% y-o-y, to 5,061 megabytes, due to our promotion of data-enabled devices, further intensive roll out of 4G/LTE network and continued increase in the number of 4G-enabled devices registered on the MegaFon network. DSU for the full year 2016 increased by 30.4% y- o- y to 4,286 megabytes, reflecting the effect of the same factors.

Disclaimers, Statement Regarding Inside Information and Forward Looking Statements 
The above discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements which are available for download on the Company's website at: http://corp.megafon.com/investors/
Some of the information in this document may be inside information.  The subject matter, the identity of the issuer, the identity of the persons making the notification and their titles, and the date and time of the notification are all as set forth above.
Certain statements and/or other information included in this document may not be historical facts and may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and Section 2(1)(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "intend", "estimate", "plans", "forecast", "project", "will", "may", "should" and similar expressions may identify forward looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans, expectations, projections, objectives, targets, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues, operations or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, our plans or intentions relating to the expansion or contraction of our business as well as specific acquisitions and dispositions, our competitive strengths and weaknesses, the risks we face in our business and our response to them, our plans or goals relating to forecasted production, reserves, financial position and future operations and development, our business strategy and the trends we anticipate in the industry and the political, economic, social and legal environment in which we operate, and other information that is not historical information, together with the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements. By their very nature, forward looking statements involve inherent risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding our present and future business strategies and the political, economic, social and legal environment in which we will operate in the future. We do not make any representation, warranty or prediction that the results anticipated by such forward-looking statements will be achieved, and such forward-looking statements represent, in each case, only one of many possible scenarios and should not be viewed as the most likely or standard scenario. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or in any other factors affecting such statements.
 
Schedule 1: Definitions
 
Wireless Subscriber is defined as each SIM card that is activated in our billing system or has had at least one chargeable traffic event (that is, use of voice, VAS or data transfer services) within the preceding three months, whether chargeable to the subscriber or to a third party (for example, interconnection charges payable by other operators). Where an individual person holds more than one SIM card, each SIM card is included as a separate subscriber. 
 
Data service user is defined as a subscriber who has consumed any amount of data traffic within preceding month. 
 
ARPDU (Average Monthly Revenue Per Data Services User) is calculated for a given period by dividing the Company's data services revenues for a given period by the average number of its data services users during that period, and further dividing the result by the number of months in that period.
 
DSU (Monthly Average Data Services Usage per User) is calculated by dividing the total number of megabytes transferred by our network during a given period by the average number of data services users during such period and dividing the result by the number of months in such period. 
 
OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortisation) is a financial measure which should be considered as supplementary, but not as an alternative to the information provided in the financial statements of the Company. OIBDA margin means OIBDA as a percentage of revenue. The Company believes that OIBDA provides a better measure of the Company's actual operational results including our ability to finance capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments and our ability to incur and service debt. While it does not take into account depreciation of property and equipment, amortisation of intangible assets and gain/(loss) from disposal of non-current assets, which are considered as operating expenses in IFRS, these expenses primarily represent non-cash charges related to long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. OIBDA is widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies as a measure to evaluate and compare current and future operating performance and to determine the value of companies within the telecommunications industry. 
 
Adjusted OIBDA is OIBDA net of impairment charge. A reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to operating profit is provided in Schedule 2. 
 
Net Profit is profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company.
 
EPS (Earnings per Share) means an amount of the Company's profit allocated to one share of its stock, and is calculated by dividing Net Profit for a reporting period by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. No earnings are allocated to treasury shares.
 
Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting both numerator and denominator in the EPS calculation so as to reflect the effect of including the additional shares that would have been outstanding if all options and other rights to acquire shares had been converted into actual shares.
 
Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) comprises the cost of purchases of new equipment, new construction, acquisition of new or upgrades to software, acquisition of spectrum and other intangible assets, and purchases of other long-term assets, together with related costs incurred prior to the intended use of the applicable assets, all accounted for as of the earliest time of payment or delivery. Long-term assets obtained through business combinations are not included in the calculation of capital expenditures. 
   
Free Cash Flow means cash from operating activities, less cash paid for purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets, increased by proceeds from sales of property and equipment and interest received. It is a financial measure which should be considered as supplementary but not as an alternative to the information provided in the Company's financial statements. This metric measures the Company's ability to generate cash after accruals required to maintain and expand the Company's assets. A reconciliation of free cash flow and cash from operating activities is provided in Schedule 2. 
 
Net debt position means the difference between (a) cash, cash equivalents, and principal amount of deposits and (b) principal amount of loans and borrowings less unamortised debt issuance fees. It is a financial measure which should be considered as supplementary but not as an alternative to the information provided in the Company's financial statements. The Company believes that this metric provides useful information as to the liquidity position of the Company after debt repayments. A description of how the metric is calculated is provided in Schedule 2.

Innovative Products and Value Added Services

We are committed to the development of new products and continued enhancement of existing products, translating innovations and new technologies into convenient, useful services, and thus creating added value for both consumers and our business partners.


Our current offering includes a wide range of innovative products and value added services (VAS), specifically in M2M services, cloud solutions, mobile advertising, TV and other segments. 


In 2015, MegaFon focused on developing and launching new services across several areas: video services, financial services, cloud solutions, convergent services, mobile advertising, M2M, and Big Data. 


We aim to keep our focus on a limited portfolio of selected product initiatives, because this allows us to develop high-quality, well-designed products which consumers will embrace enthusiastically, which in turn helps us maintain MegaFon’s profile as a technology leader and lays a solid foundation for creating new revenue streams.


MegaLabs, our wholly-owned subsidiary, spearheads the development of most of MegaFon’s new products and services. Today, MegaLabs employs 160 technical experts and professionals working in project management, product marketing, application and system development, customer research and industry collaboration.




Video services 

2015 marked a milestone in the development of our MegaFon TV product. During the year we implemented a new growth strategy for this service aimed at attracting new subscribers and reinforcing the loyalty of existing subscribers, as well as capturing revenue in the rapidly developing ОТТ services market.



330,000
active users of
MegaFon TV


In May 2015, MegaFon TV launched a new content offer for subscribers to the ‘Vse vklyucheno’ line of tariff plans and options: 50 TV channels and up to four movies per month at no extra charge.


Today, the size of the Russian market for legal paid content is estimated at RUB 25 bn (according to a study by Ernst & Young); however, in 2015, the combined earnings of all players in this market were under RUB 7 bn. This was mostly due to the spread of online piracy, low awareness among customers of the benefits of using legitimate services, conservatism on the part of content owners, and high rates charged for content. MegaFon believes that, by providing its subscribers with attractive tariff plans and options providing access to movies and TV content, it can remove the obstacles to consumption of legal paid content by users and open up new opportunities for rights holders to monetise their content.


We ran an advertising campaign in December 2015 and January 2016, at the end of which over 400,000 subscribers had signed up to the MegaFon TV service, with 70% of them taking advantage of our special offer. By the end of January 2016, the number of active users from among our subscribers reached 330,000 (as compared to 30,000 active users at the end of 2014). At the beginning of 2016, the number of subscribers actively buying extra content via the MegaFon TV service reached 45,000. The growth of the user base was clearly driven by our subscribers to  ‘Vse vklyucheno’ tariff plans and Internet options.


According to a service user survey, 70% of subscribers to ‘Vse vklyucheno’ tariff plans and options are satisfied with the special offer, including 61% of users who rated the MegaFon TV service as “good” or “excellent” . 


Today, the MegaFon TV service offers a range of content unique in the market: over 130 TV channels including HD TV channels, movies by Russian and foreign production companies, childrens’ content, and a host of TV series. The service can be accessed on iOS and Android mobile devices, PCs, Smart TV, and Samsung and LG TV sets. Subscribers pay for content using their current accounts opened with the operator. 


The Company’s plans to further develop the MegaFon TV service include continued expansion of the content library, extending the range of devices that can be used to access the service (including Apple TV, Chromecast, and Android TV television sets and set-top boxes), as well as providing access to exclusive content. 



M2M and geo-services

We offer both universal М2М products for cross-industry applications and bespoke solutions to meet very specific needs. To bring innovative М2М solutions to market we collaborate with software companies whose technologies have been successfully tried and tested in the IT market. Despite the fact that MegaFon has started developing M2M services quite recently, MegaFon had more than 1.6 m M2M users (SIM cards) as at the end of 2015. Our share of the М2М services market accounted for almost one quarter of the market, with the total market size estimated at seven m users (at the end of 2015).



>1.6m
M2M SIM cards
at the end of 2015


MegaFon’s M2M Monitoring platform targets large and medium-sized companies with five and up to several thousand employees and managing a pool of SIM cards that require online real-time M2M remote control and monitoring. M2M Monitoring enables them to transmit data between devices and gather information on their location, network activity, and traffic consumption. The platform can be adapted to any industry and provides flexible functionality and a user-friendly interface to meet the SIM card management needs of this business segment. During 2015, this solution was deployed across all MegaFon’s branches. In 2015, the M2M Monitoring service was significantly improved – its performance was enhanced; and the service was integrated with other MegaFon’s platforms, enabling integration with IT systems of our corporate clients via API. The enhancements gave the product a number of unique features, providing an edge over competition.


Our Employee Monitoring service was further developed in 2015. The service is mostly used by credit institutions, production and service companies, and taxi services. The solution enables customers to easily pinpoint employees’ locations through interactive maps in the service interface. The Employee Monitoring service provides an option of tracking employees’ movements, with movement reports sent via email, including at preset time intervals. The service also allows selection of areas on a map (e.g. warehouses, offices, etc.) to monitor when individual employees visit these places. Customers can exchange text messages with their employees via the service interface. The service functionality enables customers to improve HR management and drive task performance. As part of our efforts to further develop the service, in 2015, we launched Tracker mobile app for iOS devices, which improves location accuracy for subscribers using the Apple products. 


Our Car Fleet Monitoring service enables corporate clients to monitor and track their vehicle fleets in real time. Through a powerful combination of software and hardware, installed in vehicles and company control rooms, clients can monitor mileage, idle time and fuel consumption. Through this service our customers can save up to 30% of their costs due to reduced vehicle misuse.


Our Remote Device Management service is based on wireless control of networked, remotely located assets, e.g. payment terminals, retail vending machines, security and alarm systems, filling stations, and gas, heat or electricity distribution grids. The service permits the monitoring of the operation of remote devices and rapid detection of issues, collecting data from hundreds of various devices in real time.


In 2015, our biggest project in the M2M segment was the signing of a contract with RT-Invest Transport Systems for the supply of М2М solutions, which will be used to pay road tolls collected for road repairs on federal highways. Under the contract, MegaFon will supply up to two m SIM cards, which will be fitted into in-vehicle devices for trucks.


Our customer offering also includes geolocation services such as Radar, which is used by EMERCOM of Russia’s Liza Alert search-and-rescue volunteer group, which saves from danger more than 200 people a year. The Radar service enables subscribers to locate other subscribers both on their own and other networks. At the end of 2015, the Radar service user base reached 800,000 subscribers.


The solution is capable of tracking the geolocation of every member of a rescue team, networking all users, and enabling a team coordinator to give them more clear instructions, which allows a manifold increase in the efficiency of the rescue effort. Radar can also be used in personal life, e.g. parents can use the service on their phones to track their children in real time.



Big Data

Big Data technology provides advanced analytics tools for processing vast amounts of data to drive business efficiencies, develop new products, and improve overall competitive edge. Extracting information from big data sets delivers benefits that are not available with more traditional approaches to data analytics, e.g.,  through more accurate assessment of a product’s potential, more efficient CAPEX allocation, and providing a fundamentally different customer experience than that offered in traditional industries, all by smart solutions and services based on machine learning technology. Our clients in this business segment include Russia’s leading banks, transport companies, and retail chains.


Businesses, including banks, are increasingly using MegaFon’s Big Data geospatial analytics tool to drive their decision-making. This service enables clients to develop behavioural models for large groups of people, and provides an automated data processing solution based on mobile technologies to generate real-time analysis of data a client needs. Insights from such accurate analytics help businesses improve their understanding of customer preferences, reduce operating costs, and increase profit. 


We also have strong relationships with municipal authorities, including the Moscow Government, which relies on MegaFon’s geospatial analytics services for effective transport planning and smart planning of real-estate development of new territories as part of the city development programmes. We also use Big Data solutions in upgrades of our own network infrastructure, in launching new points of sale, and generally in our cost-cutting efforts and analyses of investment efficiency across areas of our business.


In 2015, we expanded our range of Big Data analytics services, and introduced a new functionality that offers the ability to monitor passenger flow transport mode. This new solution enables transport companies to estimate the size and structure of passenger transportation markets for services both within and between cities, across all transport modes and without the need to install sensors or any other additional meters. Offering a level of detail down to a few minutes, the service enables accurate estimates of passenger flows across modes of transport – from air to road (cars and buses), and transfers between them. The operator’s systems record load data for base stations, which show changes reflecting subscriber flows. Transport companies can use insights from this data to allocate the share and volume of traffic to individual routes, estimate transfers to other modes of transport and carriers, identify weak spots in timetables, optimise route network, and reallocate resources.


In 2015, the contribution of Big Data services to MegaFon’s B2C revenue accounted for 1.7%.



Cloud and IT solutions

With the launch of MegaDisk, MegaFon became the first mobile operator in Russia to offer a secure and easy cloud solution providing unlimited data storage and syncing on PC, Mac, Android and iOS smartphones.

In 2014, this solution was deployed across all MegaFon’s branches, and in December 2014, unlimited data storage became available to all users of MegaDisk. In 2015, we continued enhancing the MegaDisk service. The service is free to all MegaFon clients and enables users to combine and access files across multiple internet-connected devices.


Over 2015, the number of users of MegaDisk service almost quadrupled compared to 2014, and exceeded 55,000 clients. 


In 2015, we continued to develop user-friendly, convenient and flexible products to enhance customer experience and maximise customer satisfaction. At the very start of 2015, our Online Conferences service was made available to customers across all branches of MegaFon, offering a seamless experience of video conferencing and webinars. The service rapidly gained in popularity due to its user friendly and intuitive interface, flexible pricing and the ability to apply it without installment of any additional software.


In September 2015, we launched a fully updated version of our Virtual Office. This cloud-based telephony system solution for small and medium-sized companies enables deployment of a corporate virtual network in the office space in a few minutes, call distribution to employees’ desktop and mobile phones, integration with the CRM system, call recording option, etc. As companies seek cost optimisation opportunities, MegaFon is focusing on the phone functionality that can boost sales, such as call history, data visualisation, individual performance reports, integration capability with any IT systems a client may have, telephone event notification, etc.


As part of our B2B Online Cloud concept, we seek to make MegaFon’s services even more user-friendly. With this objective, in late 2015, we launched a service enabling the electronic completion of contracts for mobile services. Customers can now prepare and sign documents online, using an electronic signature, a solution used by companies in Russia to submit reports to the relevant public authorities. We have already received many positive responses from our customers, and will continue developing the B2B Online Cloud services in 2016.



Financial services

MegaFon’s mobile financial services and products enable our subscribers to conduct a wide range of personal banking and accounting tasks through their mobile phones and tablets. 


Our financial services allow MegaFon’s customers to use their mobile phone accounts to make easy and secure payments for goods and services in over 5,000 online shops. The list of participating online retailers is constantly increasing, with more and more customers benefiting from moving their payments online, including internet, utility, TV, and telephone bills, traffic fines, bank loan repayments, and money transfers, all directly from a mobile phone account.



10m
unique users of
MegaFon's mobile
payment solutions


In 2015, we continued enhancing our financial services offering, increasing the number of unique users of our mobile payment solutions to ten m, with the average number of users of mobile payment services reaching approximately three m at the end of the year. In 2015, the number of mobile payments made via our financial solutions increased by almost 14% year-on-year.


In 2015, we implemented a number of mobile commerce offerings, with the expectation of realising significant benefits early in 2016.


The launch of our Mobile Ticket service marked a milestone in the development of payment capabilities provided by a mobile phone account. The product initiative was implemented in conjunction with the Moscow Government’s Transport Department and the Moscow Metro. Starting from September 2015, owners of NFC-enabled (Near Field Communication) smartphones and SIM cards can pay their fare on any public transit system in Moscow by simply tapping their device on a ticket gate validator. The fare is charged to the subscriber’s Mobile Ticket account at the rate offered by Troika transport e-cards (e-wallets). The Mobile Ticket account is topped-up automatically from the subscriber’s mobile phone account. Over 7,000 people have already used the service in the few months since its launch, and their numbers are growing.


In 2015, we continued expanding our own terminal payment network. This project was scaled up to the federal level, with the number of terminals increased to 1,754 units (twice as much as in 2014) and payment volumes growing 93% year-on-year. Now that a payment terminal is available in almost every one of MegaFon’s own retail stores, we no longer need to use third-party terminals, and can save on payment processing fees and get the extra benefit of using the terminals as an additional tool to promote our own services and products. In implementing this project we mostly focus on expanding the list of services customers can pay for using our payment terminals. The technical integration of the processing system and the 1C system of MegaFon Retail enabled us to launch a bank loan repayment service. We have also made it possible for subscribers pay for other popular services such as payment of utility bills and traffic fines, etc. 



Mobile advertising

In 2015 MegaFon continued to develop its Mobile Advertising and Mobile Notification services. These services enable our corporate clients to reach their target audience of MegaFon subscribers quickly and reliably to inform them about new offers via SMS.


For our clients in the financial sector we launched the Status option, a security solution protecting subscribers against fraud. This option provides an extra layer of protection for remote banking, as well as for any other service that uses customers’ mobile devices (email systems, social media apps, e-wallets, etc.). The service provides clients with information about the current status of various customer identifiers (SIM card change, registering on the network, etc.).
In 2015, our total revenue from our Mobile Advertising and Mobile Notification services was over RUB 4 bn.



Converged services

MegaFon’s converged services have also gained in popularity in 2015, with the total number of their users growing 20% year-on-year. Our convergent (FMC) services, primarily focused on corporate clients, are available in all regions of Russia and provide solutions which facilitate the management of voice calls, call forwarding, and the use of other communications technologies. These solutions include: mobile call termination on fixed-line networks or calls over IP connection, short codes, hotlines, quick dial codes, ‘8-800’ free call numbers, MultiFon and Virtual PBX services.

  Mobile voice

The traditional voice services have remained the largest segment of our business; however the share of voice revenue in total revenue has been declining every year due to growing mobile data usage and the increasing popularity of OTT content. Despite the decline in revenue, mobile voice communications remain an in-demand service and a part of everyday life in modern Russia. As such, we are committed to the ongoing development of this segment. Furthermore, the potential for achieving high levels of gross margin remains strong for voice services. 


In 2015, the majority of MegaFon’s product initiatives in mobile voice services focused on growing the volumes of voice traffic within MegaFon’s own network (on-net voice traffic) and increasing the proportion of subscribers using our ‘Vse vklyucheno’ (‘Everything included’) bundled tariffs.


To increase on-net traffic consumption in July 2015 we refined our ‘Perekhodi na 0’ (‘Switch to Zero’) tariff, introducing free on-net calls within the region in which the subscriber resided. Our marketing initiatives in the voice segment were mostly focused on promoting this tariff plan.


To increase the proportion of subscribers using bundled tariffs we actively promoted our bundled tariff line ‘Vse vklyucheno’, which represents a package of voice minutes, messages and mobile data traffic to stimulate take-up of these tariff packages. The marketing campaigns with special price offers for ‘Vse vklyucheno S’ for RUB 190/month held in March 2015 and for ‘Vse vklyucheno M’ for RUB 290/month held in November–December 2015 enabled us to double the share of customers using the ‘Vse vklyucheno’ bundled tariffs. In March 2016, we transformed our bundled tariffs and tailored them to meet the specific needs of each individual branch according to the local consumption patterns for each service type.


In 2015, our ‘Perekhodi na 0’ tariff and the bundled tariff line ‘Vse vklyucheno’ were the most popular among our subscribers, accounting for 40% and 31% of new subscriptions, respectively.


The deployment of VoLTE (Voice over LTE/Long Term Evolution) technology, a voice service based on the 4G mobile wireless communications standard, to be launched in the nearest future, will become an important milestone in the development of both voice and LTE services. VoLTE’s key benefits include faster call setup times (less than a second), high quality of voice communications creating the effect of presence, and an option to shift part of the voice traffic onto the LTE network, reducing the load on our 2G and 3G networks. As of 31 August 2015, trial VoLTE calls were available on our 4G network in MegaFon’s Stolichny Branch (Moscow and Moscow region). VoLTE will be commercially launched as soon as all necessary approvals are obtained from the industry regulator.



Mobile data

Mobile data remains the key growth driver for our business. In 2015, we focused on developing our 4G and 3G networks by expanding the coverage and improving the quality of communications, stimulating higher mobile data usage through special price offers, new offers, and upgrades of our tariffs and internet options, and promoting data-enabled devices in our controlled retail channels.


In 2015, we upgraded our ‘Vse vklyucheno’(‘Everything included’)packages and internet options, significantly increasing the amounts of available data traffic without increasing the price. Specifically, we doubled the amount of traffic available under the ‘M’ and ‘L’ internet options, increasing the amount of traffic available during the day to the amount available at night-time. 


We also introduced two new internet options for tablet users — ‘Internet Tablet XS’ and ‘Internet Tablet S’, available throughout Russia. The ‘Internet Tablet XS’ option was launched for tablet owners who mostly use Wi-Fi networks and rarely use mobile data. As part of the offering, customers subscribing to the option get free 600 MB of traffic per month (20 MB per day) and if they need more traffic on certain days, they can activate an extra mobile data allowance option for an extra charge. At the end of 2015, 75,000 customers were using the option. The ‘Internet Tablet S’ option was launched to target more active tablet users, who get a certain mobile date amount for a monthly subscription fee. 

DSU1,(MB per month)2



1  DSU (monthly average data services usage per user) is
calculated by dividing the total number of megabytes
transferred by our network during a given period by
the average number of data services users during
such period and dividing the result by the number of
months in such period.2  Some of the operating KPIs presented here vary
from those reported earlier due to the change in
methodology for data service users calculation.
Data service user is defined as a subscriber who has
consumed any amount of data traffic within preceding
month.


In September 2015, we ran a marketing promotion to boost 4G internet consumption, under which subscribers for the ‘Internet S-XL’ line were given an extra 4G data allowance good through the end of the year, which was equal to the data allowance already available under their existing plan. 


In November 2015, we offered our customers a completely unique product – a driver’s tablet, which is a plug-and-play complete packaged solution. The package includes a tablet, tablet car charger, in-car tablet holder, and pre-activated ‘Internet S’ option. The package was priced at RUB 2,490. This was the first solution of its kind offered in the Russian market. The pre-activated internet option enables our customers to use the device not just to navigate the car, but also to read news online or use social media without leaving their car.


By the end of 2015, MegaFon’s data service user base increased 6.8% to 29.9 m people. At the same time, the number of data service users in Russia grew by 6.9% to 29.3 m, accounting for 39.2% of our overall subscriber base in the country. This growth was driven by our marketing efforts, continued development of our 3G and 4G networks, higher penetration rates for data-enabled mobile devices, and promotions in our controlled retail channels. At the end of 2015, the share of data-enabled devices on the MegaFon network increased to 53%.


In 2015, as mobile data usage grew, DSU (monthly average data services usage per user) in Russia increased by 25.7% year-on-year to 3,286 MB per month. Our ARPDU (average monthly revenue per data services user) increased by 10.4% year-on-year to RUB 233. Overall, in 2015, our revenue from mobile data services was RUB 79.9 bn (or 25.5% of total revenue), up 19.0% from 2014.


In 2015, the increase in the volume of traffic was driven mostly by traffic in our 4G network, which grew 45% year-on-year, accounting for approx. 40% of the total traffic. As of 31 December 2015, 7.85 m 4G-enabled devices were registered on the MegaFon network, up 34% compared to 2014. 


With the active development of 4G networks, subscribers are becoming more demanding of the quality of data transmission services they get. As services such as audio streaming, HD video, online games, and social media are gaining in popularity, and consequently boost the volumes of traffic flows, customers increasingly seek consistently high-speed data services and fast response times. Therefore, ensuring adequate network capacity is on top of the current agenda for operators.


To address this need Megafon commercially launched the 4G/LTE-Advanced standard in 2014. It is currently the most advanced standard in mobile data services, enabling subscribers to use video chats with no video or sound latency, watch TV programmes or HD movies online, and download large image galleries or archived files virtually wherever they are. At the end of 2015, LTE-Advanced services were available in nine major Russian cities at speeds of 150 Mbit/s–450 Mbit/s.

In 2015, MegaFon continued to roll out its LTE-Advanced
network based on the existing 4G base station infrastructure.
At the end of 2015, LTE-Advanced 4G high‑speed internet
services with the speeds of 150 Mbit/s‑450 Mbit/s were
available to subscribers in nine major Russian cities.

Mobile devices 

The sale of our branded (customised) affordable data-enabled devices is one of the key elements of our marketing efforts to promote higher data usage among customers. MegaFon sells the following types of branded mobile devices: smartphones, tablets, WiFi routers and modems. At the end of 2015, the Company’s portfolio comprised 50 models of MegaFon-branded devices, including eight smartphone models and three tablet models. In addition, our product range included 29 models of 4G-enabled devices. 


In 2015, to stimulate sales of branded devices we ran several marketing promotions offering MegaFon Login smartphones and big-screen MegaFon Login phablets at MegaFon Retail stores specially priced for customers subscribing to MegaFon’s internet option or tariff plans. We also promoted our branded routers, in particular MegaFon MR300 router, which was offered at a reduced price.

B2X telecommunication services

Across our B2X portfolio, which combines the B2B, B2G and B2O segments, we provide a full range of telecoms services, with a focus on connecting employees, and monitoring and managing corporate SIM cards and devices. MegaFon’s sustained growth in the corporate segment is driven by our commitment to deliver high reliability and assured quality of service, flexible tariffs, and multifunctional solutions tailored precisely to customer requirements.



B2B/B2G
mobile data revenue
growth

+30.9%



In 2015, the number of MegaFon’s B2G and В2B customers grew 5% year-on-year to 286,000 legal entities. In the B2B and B2G segments, we managed to acquire several large and medium-sized corporate and government customers, some of whom became our clients as a result of the implementation of the MNP (mobile number portability) process. 


In 2015, we delivered strong performance in the B2B and B2G segments, growing total revenue by 8.2% year-on-year, mobile voice revenue by 6.6% year-on-year, and mobile data revenue by 30.9% year-on-year. 


During 2015, we enhanced our customer offering by launching a number of new products and services. In particular, in June 2015, we commercially launched our Wi-Fi with Authorisation service at the federal level. The service will enable MegaFon’s partners to offer Wi-Fi access to customers, e.g. visitors in a café or a store, as well their employees. Customers will be provided with user authorisation service to access the internet, in full compliance with the statutory requirement for mandatory identification of users accessing public WiFi hotspots. Several major corporate clients and the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation have already signed up to the service since its launch.


In 2015, to keep up with the current trend of document management automation, MegaFon launched its Electronic Document Flow service. Businesses can use this service to deploy e-invoicing and e-signature solutions enabling e-document exchange with other businesses using the service. Corporate users of the service also benefit from instant access to communications service invoices and bills. The Electronic Document Flow service enables our customers to streamline administrative processes and achieve significant cost savings.


In June 2015, we launched a unique service for secure encryption of data transmitted over VPN networks. The service enables full protection of data transmitted over fixed lines against external intrusion or theft. To deploy this solution an existing VPN network is equipped with a special tool which encrypts all data flows that pass through it. The cryptographic service is provided in full compliance with the applicable Russian national standard, GOST 28147–89, and meets regulatory requirements, including those by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). We expect that the bulk of the demand for this service will come from government agencies, financial organisations, security services, and entities focused on personal data processing.


In 2015, we also further refined our Online Conferences, Virtual Office and Employee Monitoring services.


We maintained our focus on developing our M2M Monitoring (machine-to-machine) service, which enables our clients to control and monitor the movements, location and condition of devices and equipment via a SIM card transmitting mobile data. Over 2015, the M2M Monitoring solution was deployed across all of MegaFon’s operations; its performance was enhanced; and the service was integrated with other MegaFon’s platforms, enabling integration with IT systems of our corporate clients via API. At the end of 2015, the total number of users of this M2M service (SIM cards) exceeded 1.6 m.


We continued developing our content delivery network (CDN), offering our customers customised CDN solutions to meet their diverse content-related needs: assured delivery of content to remote areas, streamlining video files during online broadcasts, ensuring accessibility during peak hours, providing high-speed transmission, etc. Our clients in this area include Russia’s leading content providers, software suppliers, online movie portals, TV channels, online stores, and game developers. In 2015, we added Russia’s largest TV channel, Channel One, to our list of clients. During 2015, we completed modernisation of our CDN network and increased its capacity by over 40%. 


In the B2O segment, the DREAM project remains our top priority. The project aims to optimise and enhance connectivity between Europe and Asia. By the end of 2015, we had ten leading global and Russian operators connected to the DREAM backbone line, including  China Telecom and China Unicom, and Europe’s Deutsche Telekom and Interoute.


During 2015, as part of the project, we made upgrades to some sections of the backbone line, improving DREAM’s performance on several measures. In particular, we successfully reduced the stated signal latency on Frankfurt to Hong Kong route (measured by RTD) from 175 ms to 169 ms – an industry-leading performance level. We also built an alternative gateway to Kazakhstan, which enabled us to expand our partner network in this country, and as a result, set up Europe–to–Asia links with geographic redundancy across Kazakhstan. The backbone line’s total capacity currently in use (including for MegaFon’s infrastructure needs) is 1 Tbit/s. According to TMT Consulting, our DREAM project has an approximately 8% share of the Europe–to–China landline links market.


Another key project in MegaFon’s inter-operator business was the construction, in conjunction with Georgian operator SilkNet, of the first overland cross-border backbone passage linking the two countries, along the Verkhniy-Lars–Kazbegi route. The new backbone line is offering initial capacity of 100 Gbit/s. The project enables MegaFon to offer telecoms operators in the Transcaucas region and South-West Asia access to both Russian and European internet exchange points. The project was commercially launched in early 2015. Currently, we provide IP transmission and leased line services to several local operators.


During the year, we signed contracts with several major corporate and government customers, including Novolipetsk Steel, Rosselkhozbank, VTB 24, PJSC Enel Russia, DIXY retail chain, OJSC PhosAgro, JSC Mercedes-Benz RUS, Boehringer Ingelheim, LLC Siberian Generating Company, the Ministry of the Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the Federal Guard Service (FSO), GAS Pravosudie, and LLC RT-Invest Transport Systems. And, as noted above, we provided communications support to a number of high-profile events, most notably the summit meetings of the SCO and “BRICS” groups, as well as the 2018 FIFA World Cup draw.





Fixed-line communications for the mass market

In addition to high-quality mobile services, MegaFon also offers a range of fixed-line broadband, Pay-TV and telephony services. The Company provides its fixed-line services through NetByNet Holding LLC (which operates under the NETBYNET brand), our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired in 2011. NETBYNET provide services to individual and corporate customers in seven Russian federal districts: the Central, Northwestern, North Caucasian, Southern, Volga, Ural, and Far Eastern Federal Districts.


Asset acquisitions enabling the Company to enhance its presence in the key markets and enter new territories are an important component of NETBYNET’s development strategy. Since 2011, the operator has acquired and integrated over 15 companies across Russia, significantly increasing its coverage. Rather than investing in blanket expansion of its network, the Company makes selective upgrades where they are necessary and economically viable.


In January 2016, NETBYNET completed another acquisition. The company acquired CJSC Startel and fixed assets of CJSC Startelecom-Centre. These businesses provide fixed-line services to corporate customers in the Moscow region and Tver. The acquisition of two operators with a stable customer base and attractive resource sharing potential provides a platform to consolidate NETBYNET position in the corporate market in 2016.


During 2015, NETBYNET also focused on improving service to existing customers and development of additional services. NETBYNET was the first fixed operator to launch customer support via popular messenger Viber and WhatsApp.  Marketing efforts included offer customers a new bonus programme and focussing on increasing bundled sales.


In 2015, we further developed our WiFire product. In January 2015, WiFire Mobile, based on MegaFon’s infrastructure, was launched, offering unlimited mobile Internet in Moscow and the Moscow region. It became the third service in the WiFire package, complementing the previously launched WiFire TV (wireless digital TV) and WiFire Home (residential broadband).


Our efforts to further develop the wireless digital television WiFire TV service, launched by NETBYNET in 2014, included the roll-out of the service across the network’s entire coverage area, enabling access to the WiFire TV app on Samsung and LG Smart TV television sets,  having the Wifire TV solution pre-deployed on Philips Android TV television sets, and the establishment of content partnerships with Disney and MEGOGO.


Due to our organic growth, asset integration and acquisitions, MegaFon’s fixed-line subscriber base exceeded 944,000 retail customers at the end of 2015, while the total number of Pay-TV B2C users increased by 45% to 226,000 as a result of the stepwise development of WiFire TV.


Plans for 2016 include enhancing NETBYNET’s presence in Russian regions, active promotion of the WiFire product, expansion of the Wifire TV service, and growing the share of the corporate segment in total revenue.



Roaming services

MegaFon’s roaming services are available across Russia and in more than 224 countries worldwide.


In 2015, we continued offering our customers new or improved roaming services. In particular, we launched our ‘Bood kak doma’ (‘Feel at Home’) tariff option, a unique offer that helps slash mobile costs when travelling in Russia. Customers subscribing to the option get the same rates for all calls, text messages, and mobile data services when travelling through Russia as they are charged in their region of residence. 


During the year, we also launched a new, smart notification system. All our customers travelling beyond their region of residence now receive smart international and domestic roaming offers based on a customer’s profile. In 2016, we plan to develop a notification system which will help predict customer behaviour and target our subscribers with attractive, more personalised deals.


In 2015, popular roaming products included the ‘Ves mir’ (‘Around the World’) tariff option, offering 30 free incoming minutes per day anywhere in the world, the ‘Internet za granitsey’ (‘Internet abroad’) tariff option, which in addition to an attractive mobile data deal provided genuine transparency in mobile costs, and the ‘Bood’ kak doma’ (‘Feel at Home’) tariff option, mentioned above. 


During 2015, despite the volatility in currency exchange rates we adjusted our international roaming rates just once – in February. Despite the currency exchange challenges, MegaFon has retained its leadership as the operator offering the most attractive international roaming deals.


4G roaming services



79
operators provide
4G roaming services
to MegaFon

MegaFon’s international LTE roaming services were first launched in January 2014, and in two years we have grown the number of countries where MegaFon’s LTE roaming services are available to 66, with roaming agreements in place with 79 operators. 


With this growth, we have consolidated our position as one of the world’s leading telecom operators in terms of LTE-roaming coverage. In many countries of the world, we offer access to LTE networks via multiple roaming partners, which ensures better coverage and connectivity. 


Our 4G roaming service is definitely in demand among our customers, as they need the same fast mobile data services when travelling outside their region of residence as they enjoy at home. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our focus on growing the list of our LTE roaming partners. Countries with access to 4G-account for around 71% of the traffic consumed by our customers roaming internationally.

Moscow, Russian Federation - Public Joint Stock Company "MegaFon" (LSE: MFON), a leading Russian telecommunications operator ("MegaFon" or the "Company") announces the decision of its Board of Directors taken earlier today to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to approve the acquisition of 11.5 mln Class A shares and 21.9 mln ordinary shares in Mail.Ru Group Limited (LSE: MAIL) ("Mail.Ru"), currently held by subsidiaries of USM Holdings, representing an approximately 63.8% voting stake in the company.
Under the terms of the proposed transaction, MegaFon will acquire 11.5 mln Class A shares and 21.9 mln ordinary shares representing an approximately 63.8% voting stake in Mail.Ru from New Media and Technology Investment LP, New Media Technologies Capital Partners Limited and Ardoe Finance Limited, subsidiaries of USM Holdings, for an agreed consideration of $640 mln on completion plus an unconditional deferred payment of $100 mln due in one year post completion paid in cash.
MegaFon, a leading telecommunication operator in Russia, and Mail.Ru, a leader in the Russian-speaking Internet market, have been exploring a range of commercial projects aimed at creating strategic and economic value for both companies and their customers. As market dynamics and advances in technology have created favourable conditions for greater cooperation between telecom providers and digital media companies, MegaFon now sees a significant further benefit in becoming a shareholder of Mail.Ru in order to facilitate and accelerate the execution of common projects for the companies.
The transaction is aimed at achieving significant synergies for both companies, including enhancement of MegaFon's digital offering and its distribution, launch of special VKmobile offering for users of VK social network, and other potential initiatives.
Following the proposed transaction, MegaFon and Mail.Ru would continue operating as separate entities, dealing on an arms-length basis, with both independent management teams dedicated to preserving each other's corporate culture and governance, ensuring continuity of operating and product development activities, and focusing co-operation areas of mutual strategic and economic benefits. Any agreements between the companies would be on an arms-length and fully commercial basis. No significant changes are expected in Mail.Ru's core business operational activity and corporate governance system.
Sergey Soldatenkov, CEO at MegaFon, said: "We are excited to announce an opportunity to acquire a controlling stake in Mail.Ru Group, a transaction which allows MegaFon to make the next step in realisation of its digital strategy. Closer ties with Mail.Ru Group will allow us to execute common strategic projects, including, but not limited to, the creation and promotion of special offerings to digital subscribers of VKmobile based on the social network VK, and improvements in clients targeting and segmentation (which latter projects we understand have been approved by Mail.Ru). In cooperation with Mail.Ru Group MegaFon would be able to provide a premium and differentiated offering to its digital subscribers, creating value for the shareholders of both companies.
We respect Mail.Ru team and its corporate culture. As a shareholder in Mail.Ru Group we will support the Mail.Ru team's initiatives focused on further development of existing products and launch of new products".
Boris Dobrodeev, CEO at Mail.Ru Group, said: "Potential co-operation in the execution of a number of common projects, such as the launch of the special VK branded offering and the use of predictive analytics technologies offers new useful products to our user base and new opportunities for our business. MegaFon is a natural partner for Mail.Ru in various areas and we look forward to working together."
The transaction was recommended for approval by the Special Committee of MegaFon's Board of Directors, comprised of non-executive and independent directors. On 23 December 2016 the Board of Directors approved the calling of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on 20 January 2017 to approve the transaction. The transaction is also subject to receiving consent from the Russian anti-trust authorities, and subject to additional conditions, fulfilment of which is out of MegaFon's control.
Morgan Stanley is acting as financial advisor to MegaFon, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton is acting as legal advisor to MegaFon. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is acting as financial advisor to the Special Committee of MegaFon and is providing a fairness opinion. White & ?ase is acting as legal advisor to the Special Committee of MegaFon.

I will now give you some highlights of the main trends and events of the quarter, and my colleagues will then continue with a detailed discussion of our operating and financial results.In the third quarter we continue to operate in a challenging market environment with tough competition and structural changes in consumer demand. This led us to pursue new opportunities for growth and for maintaining our market share. We started exploring strategic areas through which in this new reality we could monetize our broad network, our well-developed infrastructure, and come up with new solutions that will shape our development in the long term.Read MoreMegaFon now has an extensive effort underway to create a new development strategy that would enable our progress in the direction of our choice while creating even more value for our shareholders. We should be ready to start implementing this new strategy early next year once we have received support from our Board of Directors.Having said that, I would now like to outline the broader shape of our new strategy. We want to focus on the digital customer as the key driver of our mobile revenue. As part of this approach, we will be consistently building our new and novel market offering that should keep us out of price wars and monetize our mobile data transfer services.To increase the value of our offering, we are planning to develop new businesses and partnerships with media and dotcom companies. These strategic objectives will be underpinned by our continued technology leadership through MegaFon's unique assets and expertise. We will leverage on these to ensure superior communications quality and implement innovative services ahead of the competition. We also aim to continue our focus on operating efficiency improvement including the distribution network reorganization and to review our corporate governance model.I would also like to emphasize that our new strategy will include the revision of our dividend policy so that it was better aligned with our new strategic objectives and provided better clarity on the amount and frequency of value distribution to our shareholders. We've already started preparing the ground for the implementation of new strategy by reinforcing and reshuffling our corporate structure.In October, MegaFon reorganized its principal operations into two new units, operational and commercial with a view to increase our operational efficiency across the board. These units will be led by -- and Dmitry has mentioned that they have been appointed already, and we hope that the new people on our team will help us work on the objectives that we set in front of us.Regular distributions to our shareholders remains our important commitment. Since 2012 MegaFon has paid to its shareholders RUB165 billion. I'm happy to report that the Board of Directors at the end of October recommended at the general shareholder meeting approved a further dividend payment of RUB15 billion. Pending shareholder approval in December, MegaFon is set to pay over RUB50 billion for 2016 corresponding to over RUB80 per share.In the third quarter, we signed a number of strategic operation agreements that will enable us to provide next level services in the future. For example MegaFon and Nokia signed a memorandum of cooperation for the joint development of the next generation communications standard in Russia. We intend to study the technical aspect of developments and implementation of the new standard 5G and communicate with regulatory authorities on the requirements and parameters for its commercial implementation.We aim to conduct tests of new technical solutions and potentially construct a trial 5G cluster in Russia's stadiums that will host the 2018 FIFA World Cup matches. Together with Nokia in September we conducted a test and achieved a record mobile data transfer speed just short of 5 gigabits per second. This was made possible by our competitive advantage in spectrum and Nokia's high performance equipment that is already commercially available.Also in July we signed a memorandum of cooperation with Huawei for the joint implementation of the Internet Of Things solutions. MegaFon and Huawei are already in an advanced collaboration stage for the promotion in the Russian markets of [MEU] telecommunication standard narrow band IOT. In the third quarter we also continued to launch new services. In September we launched voice over LTE in the Moscow region. This technology enables customers to access HD voice services while using mobile Internet on a 4G network and set up a connection in less than 2 seconds.The next product was presented by MegaFon in August, that's a unique financial product, the MegaFon debit card. It was launched in cooperation with MasterCard and Russia's Round Bank. The card is fully integrated with the user's mobile account and giving the features of a bank account. The card can be used for payments and there is interest accruing on the balance. The MegaFon card was initially tested in Moscow and St. Petersburg and in October it became available to clients in all Russia's regions where MegaFon operates.And with this I would now like to turn it over to Anna Serebryanikova, MegaFon's Chief Operating Officer. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Serebryanikova, MegaFon PAO - COO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you (inaudible). Let me present our development. (inaudible) development, we continued to focus the quality of both network and the services we provide. In the third quarter we remained focused on the development of our 4G network and on high speeds of mobile Internet connection. We continued increasing our 4G network, and by the end of September our services on 4G are available in 80 regions of Russian Federation, which covers more than 65% of the population, and services or prices Internet LTE (inaudible) in 25 bigger states of the country.Our 4G infrastructure expanded by 16% since the beginning of the year, and included almost 27,000 base station. The amount of 4G traffic generated over the quarter increased by 60% year on year, and it accounted for 43% of the total mobile data traffic. The increase in traffic was achieved due to our attractive offering, active marketing promotion, and growth in number of 4G devices on our network, and the number of units is approximately 9.8 million currently.In Q3 we expanded also the coverage of the LTE roaming services and increased the number of countries where subscribers can enjoy seamless roaming. LTE roaming is now available in 77 countries (inaudible) with 113 operators. Also I'm proud to say that in accordance with the spectrum sharing commission which we obtained from Roskomnadzor, Russian regulator, we opened the whole 40 megahertz band in LTE 2600 spectrum for MegaFon and Yota subscribers in Moscow.Previously we used the MVNO model. Now, each operator obtains flexibility to use the combined spectrum, and the spectrum sharing improved the customer experience and the speeds in the network.With this, I'm turning it over to Vlad Wolfson, our Chief Commercial Officer. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Anna. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Let me update you on our services that are becoming increasingly popular among our subscribers. I will start with MegaFon TV. MegaFon has a unique offering for MegaFon TV users of the so-called all-included line of bundles. We offer free access to 50 TV channels and several feature films and this traffic is now build.During 2016 to date, MegaFon TV audience has more than doubled and stood at 1.4 million users at the end of September. Approximately 80% of active MegaFon TV users also use one of our all-included bundles. And approximately 80% of active TV customers use their smartphones or tablets to consume the content. We continue adding premium HD content to our TV platform and also come up with attractive offerings together with Russia's largest corporate holders and content providers.As an example, in October MegaFon TV users were offered a unique opportunity to watch five new episodes of a locally popular TV series [Molej Yoshka] for youth sports team before it premiered on the CTC entertainment channel. We continue to improve the MegaFon TV app, and our effort bared good fruit. Currently the average user rating of our app in the largest online application and content stores is above 4 of 5 being the maximum.In the next slide, I would like to give you some more color on our new financial products. Sergey has already mentioned that in August we unveiled our MegaFon debit card. This is a product aimed to meet our users' demand for a simpler payment and money transfer vehicle. The card was initially launched in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and since October it is available across Russia.The card is fully integrated with a mobile account and has features similar to an ordinary debit card. It makes money transfers easier, offers cash-back from partners, and even has interest accrual on the balance. We believe that the card is a good solution to promote existing subscriber loyalty and attract new customers and can generate additional profit through value-added services.Since we have just launched the card, we believe it is a bit too early to share any performance numbers yet. But we will be happy to update you on that when we present full-year results. Let me just say at this point that the card is quickly picking up with our customers.And with this I would like to turn it over to Gevork Vermishyan, who will present our financial performance for the third quarter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks a lot. We're on slide 11. Our financial result third quarter -- our total revenue for the third quarter marginally decreased by 0.2% year on year reaching over RUB81 billion. We posted 3.9% decline in consolidated wireless revenue impacted by a decrease in traditional voice services in mass market. Partially that was offset by mobility revenues in B2B and B2G segments as well as in Yota.Our fixed revenue and revenue from sales and equipments and accessories continue to demonstrate healthy growth rates, almost fully offsetting the performance in mobile revenue. Nine months trend remains very positive as we consolidated revenue increase 1.5% compared to nine months of the previous year. In Q3 our OIBDA line decreased by 10.7% year on year, nonetheless showing 9% uplift sequentially.Margin-wise our Russian business demonstrated healthy 40.5% rank. Out net profit decreased by 52.3% year on year, and that was impacted by lower OIBDA, higher depreciation amortization costs, non-cash loss from equity and associates, especially Euroset, and additional income tax accruals related to tax audit in Tajikistan.In Q3 2016, our investment has decreased by 55% year on year reaching RUB12 billion. Importantly, I would like to remind here that the comparison base of Q3 2015 was elevated by the acquisition price of SMART which was capitalized in the amount of RUB5.7 billion in 2015. Net of that, our CapEx was down 42% year on year.So we managed to reduce our capital investment expenditure due to stricter prioritization of network development projects and optimization of technical solutions. For example, installation of multi-band base stations, installation of IP radio relay lines instead of fiber optic lines and various network sharing activities.I want to underpin that the reduction of CapEx had no impact on network development program as we fully implement our plans in natural terms for this year. So as a result of the above, i.e., lower CapEx coupled with realized cash extraction from idle working capital, our free cash flow increased by 61% year on year.Next coming to revenue components, our mobile revenue was down 3.9% as I mentioned year on year as its major component traditional voice services contracted due to the following factors. We discussed it before, but we want to say it again. In the end of March, we redesigned our bundled tariff plans to make our offering more competitive in terms of price and in terms of allowances.As a result of our active promotion of bundled tariffs in Q2 and Q3 this year, the number of subscribers using our bundle is drastically increasing including not only new, but including the existing clients have been switching from active -- from archive tariff plans to bundles. The introduction of free on-net calling and free national on-net roaming stimulated our clients to talk more.As a result, the share of this kind of traffic in the total voice traffic has significantly increased and we see that as a reflection in the elevated direct cost in mobility. I want to also to mention the roaming situation expectedly due to temporary closing of most popular foreign traveling destinations, more Russian citizens, more clients preferred to stay in Russia and we saw reduction in our roaming revenue.Mobile data revenue steeped in terms of its performance to 0.5% year on year despite strong expansion of a data user base by almost 8% and despite the traffic increase by 32% year on year. Our mobile data revenue is under pressure in terms of the growth rates due to higher penetration of bundled tariffs and active promotion of mobile data offerings with higher data allowances.Speaking about fixed revenue, it continued healthy performance on the back of B2B and B2C client-base expansion. So it went up 12% year on year.Sales of handsets and accessories continued to show strong momentum and increased by 38%.On the next slide, I will quickly walk you through our customers. So we managed to expand our subscriber-base by 1.6 million customers in Russia, which is an equivalent of 2.1% increase versus the previous year. Higher adoption of data mobile devices coupled with our affordable data offerings allowed us to increase the number of data users by almost 8%, reaching 41% penetration into the base.Next slide on KPIs around data. So you see that the DSU has rapidly increased by 32% in Q3 2016, driven by bundle and Internet options with higher mobile data allowances. Higher sales of data-enabled devices and also further development and improvement for our 4G service -- 4G network, which provides our subscribers with access to high-speed connectivity.Our data ARPU has decreased 5.3% year on year as market dictating APPMB price points have outweighed the bullish DSU trend.Speaking about OIBDA performance, so the contraction of gross profit margin by 4.3% was the key factor that impacted the OIBDA line. The gross profit decline was attributable through the following factors; I will name those, so I think we need more clarity on the factors.So first and foremost, the mathematical change in revenue mix in favor of low marginal segments, i.e. fixed and handset and accessories, that created a downward pressure on marginality. Absolutely on a rational stance of competition in retail sector with very tiny margins also added a lot of pressure to bottom line.Higher interconnect expenses driven by the increasing share of our outgoing calls due to generous allowances within the bundles, all that created serious pressure on the service revenue -- service gross revenue -- gross profit, I'm sorry.Sales and marketing expenses exhibited 6.2% growth due to high dealer commissions. So all above was partially balanced through G&A cost reduction which went down by 0.4%. In particular there are different trends within this group of cost line items. Rent and utilities were up 10% following the network development and following the utility cost increase -- high utility expenses.So in Q3 2016 we think it was a peak season in terms of utility costs. As tariffs in natural monopolies were indexed using the inflation levels of the previous year, which was elevated, the CPI in 2015 was very high. So we also continued to pay double rent payment attributable to our office building in Oruzheyny which we own, but we do not consolidate into our accounts.There was a downward movement in personnel expenses due to revision of bonus accruals. We also kept advertising and marketing spend under control, 6% lower year on year.So that's all on the P&L side. Let me quickly walk you through balance sheet items. In the third quarter, we continue to enjoy very favorable market sentiment and environment to replenish our liquidity at attractive rates and tenures.We remained focused on optimization of our cash and cash equivalent structure to mitigate foreign exchange fees on the liability side and ensure that all payments to our vendors in hard currencies are honored in full in hard currency. That said, in Q3 we increased the portion of hard currency in our cash and cash equivalents to 83%, which is almost equal to the hard currency nominal value of our liabilities.Our leverage ratio remained at healthy level of 1.56. It went up a little bit from the previous quarter due to the payment of dividends in the amount of RUB35 billion.Lastly on this part of the presentation, a few words on the debt portfolio structure. We extended the maturity of the -- of the debt portfolio significantly, moving the repayments to 2022 and 2023rd year. So now the average loan life exceeds three years.We increased the ruble debt of component in our debt portfolio to 90% using and including the hedges, so using the -- or activating the hedging strategy. So matching the portfolio ruble equivalent of debt portfolio to cash and cash equivalent in hard currencies.Lastly in my side of the presentation, I have a few words about the guidance. We reiterate the guidance on the revenue from flat to low single-digit growth rate. Certain events that took place in Q2, Q3 force us to review the guidance on OIBDA by only RUB2 billion, so from RUB120 billion to RUB118 billion.I'm sure you will ask questions, so I will explain the reasons during the Q&A, but that RUB2 billion reduction in our outlook was compensated with the revision -- downward revision of our CapEx guidance from RUB70 billion to RUB68 billion so that the net cash position remained intact.That's all on my side and I give the floor to moderator to run Q&A. Thank you.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, your work I guess preempted the question, so yes indeed, if you would be so kind to go maybe in the same detail in terms of understanding where the pressure comes on the cost side? And specifically also one more question there on the salaries and accruals, would you expect a sort of reversal in the Q4 and so do we see this 3Q more like an outlier or this is (inaudible) there? So that's the first question.Second question on your data revenues, I mean you had two quarters, if you look quarter on quarter pretty flat data revenue growth, and now you have the slight recovery. So do you see this as sort of the end of the conversion into the bundles and bigger consumption kicking in or this is still too early to say that the data revenues will start growing again from this point onwards?And a last one maybe very quickly, and appreciate on the new card that you cannot give much information, but I just wanted to know what do you expect to get from the introduction of the card because you do incur certain costs, 8% on the balances, understandably it's a loyalty card as well, but what is the general expectation? How should we kind of judge on it, is it the retention, is it the revenue attached to that you expect to have or how do we look at the card introduction beyond the obvious ones so to say?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'll take first question on the cost side. So what are the one-off factors that on top of what I said explaining the performance cost line items driving the OIBDA in Q3, what will happen in Q4 and what brings the guidance on OIBDA RUB2 billion down. The first, so we have to compare it with sort of the business plan that we had in 2015 for 2016. In fact this business plan, we did not expect such drastic competition in the retail sector in distribution.We expected some gross profit coming out from sales and equipment. We expect the margin there, but as I want to underscore, absolutely rational performance of the players on the retail distribution market almost led the whole revenue profitability to a zero margin, or very tiny margin, so we just lost serious quantum of OIBDA from the initial plan. That's first.Second, we anticipated that in 2016, we will accomplish one big integrated project with B2G client. This in progress, we are on it, but seems that we'll not be completing that on time, it will be deferred to 2017, so part of the EBITDA attributable to that, it's a project, slide to 2017 and it's not in 2016. And thirdly we didn't expect that drastic tax audits and fiscal pressure in Tajikistan, so we will have to record RUB1.2 billion in additional reserves. All that drives our view that would rather be sort of in line with reality and guide you in markets as it goes trend-wise, factoring this one-off event.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sorry, Kazakhstan is yet to be charged, right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm sorry, can you repeat?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I said Kazakhstan which you mentioned is not charged for the Q4?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, that is an accrual. Cash-wise it's not sort of charged in (inaudible), but management assumes that the probability of cash tax is 100%, so we sort of accrued 100% basis. Now in terms of sellers and accruals, yes, you should read this as a one-off reversal of provision that has been made in Q1, Q2, Q3, now reversed in Q3 -- sorry, Q1 and Q2, assuming that the targets will be achieved on medium level.Now when we have more crystallization view what will be the year-end and what will be the achievement of the targets, we reverse in Q3 the provision for bonuses, so Q4 will be elevated sequentially.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On data, yes, let me start, maybe Vlad will add couple of words. I think the whole situation around data revenue is coming as a result of general trend that MegaFon has made a decision to eliminate the price premiums on bundled tariffs in Q4 -- first quarter this year. So we had to stay price-point-wise as close to the market as possible.We were not driving this competition, we're not driving the price wars, we were reacting, but not overreacting. So the revenue allocation which we earn -- the monthly fees which we earn from the clients on to the revenue products. i.e., voice, SMS, data, value services remained intact percentage-wise. So all that happened is that revenue on data particularly, i.e., part of the bundle allocated on data revenue have suffered a contraction in terms of the ARPUs because the new ARPU or ARPU for a new customer is definitely lower than the ARPU for archived (inaudible), so there was that factor.Yes, good. On the third question about MegaFon bank card, Vlad, I think you will have to take it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you Gevork. Alex, thank you for your question on MegaFon cards. First of all, I would like to say that obviously this card today is a new product in the financial area for us, and indeed is related to certain costs for its launch and servicing. We do not position ourselves as a bank. This is a partnership project and our costs are much lower than for any other card issues in the market.As for the economics of the projects, it is as you have justly asked, is two-fold. The first component and perhaps the main component is and will continue to be the loyalty of our customers and retaining them with MegaFon, but the project also has a revenue side, and as we have mentioned, the performance of the bank card project, we'll provide an update on that when we discuss 2016 results for the full year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, that's fine. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My first question is about the growth outlook for next year. Can you please elaborate a little on what you expect given the recent probably little positive price action in the market with the elimination of national roaming -- sorry, introduction of national roaming fees actually, some price increases here and there, do you expect maybe some data growth acceleration, some voice revenue stabilization, any color on that will be very helpful.The second question is on your payables, so the payables, there was a negative change in the payables and the cash flow of more than RUB8 billion in the third quarter. I just wanted to ask what it's related to and whether it will be reversed shortly, maybe in the fourth quarter and the first half of 2017?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork, I'll take the question. So in terms of the growth outlook for next year, as you may perceive, we're not ready at this point of time to give you guidance in terms of numbers and structure for 2017 yet. It will be done in the course of full-year announcement results later next year, but I think we are in position to give you general sentiment and cautious hope that overall based on the Q2 and Q3 announced accounts by all players in this industry, we really understand that the market is too -- an overly competitive, there is no room for further innovation and development of investments with this kind of prices.And irrational competition is no longer -- should no longer stay in place. We are receiving these signals from the numbers that are competitive support, the numbers that we support, so we cautiously think that in terms of core products, the main [directionalization] of behavior. In terms of distribution the margin will come back to the market on handsets and accessories and we think that this really can happen alongside with more warm sentiment on the macro side next year. Yes, if I addressed this question, can you please repeat the question on APs?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, of course. So there was the reduction payables of about RUB8 billion in the third quarter. I was just wondering whether -- what it's related to and whether it will be reversed in the fourth quarter maybe or sometime shortly?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, understood. So in terms of AP as big part of working capital component we -- I don't know if we commented that before, we ordered a lot of retail inventory in Q2 to make sure that we smoothly bypass the launch of our SAP retail project. On 1st of July it went live called [Jur]. So we have -- as we have deferred payment obligations with vendors that supply this retail equipment to us, so that was accounts payables. When we paid out this accounts, the accounts payables reduced. So that's one. And secondly -- second -- that was the biggest one to be honest. Second was the mentioned factor around regional bonus ancillary.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So basically we should not expect this item to kind of reverse or change in the future, right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, it is a seasonal item obviously and you should expect some movements in Q4 as -- and Q1 next year as we supply the necessary quantum of network and have deferred payment obligations. The APs can be increased a little bit through that period and then reduced in Q1.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital - Analyst [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Looking at your accounts we can see that this figure of yours is loss-making and do you want to change anything in Euroset operations as your shareholder and whether you have a common understanding with your partners about the future of that company? If you could share your insights on that it would be very useful and interesting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you for your question. Vlad Wolfson will handle your question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) As of today we don't have any special plans to change the way Euroset operates. We are currently looking at different options for the development of our distribution channels in general, and we look at different implementation options, but let me say that today no decision is final and no specific decisions have been made yet in terms of our day-to-day operation or the day-to-day operation of Euroset. As a shareholder we participate in this supervisory board together with the other shareholder VimpelCom, so your question about whether we coordinate our actions, yes, we do when we work with the assets and (inaudible) continues.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital - Analyst [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Will there be any clarity about Euroset at the beginning of 2017 when you intend to announce your new strategy? And secondly, looking at the results of the previous quarter, there was some expectation that in the second half of this year there will be an optimization of retail network. So has there been any developments there and what was the performance of the number of retail points?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Very clear questions. Currently we do not have any timing during which we contemplate any changes in the Euroset operations. As for our own retail, we have already shared with you that we are fully satisfied with the operation of our internal -- of our owned network both by quality and by volume, and we believe that the volume of distribution channels in the Russian market in our view is quite high. So we indeed plan to change the number of retail points in the future, but in a gradual manner, not in any large movements. So we are working very gradually to optimize our own network.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Semenov, Deutsche Bank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Semenov, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) I just wanted to clarify on the guidance. Did I understand correctly that RUB1.2 billion in Tajikistan, this will be an additional hit to EBITDA in Q4, or this as well -- I mean on my estimate the -- so for the negative EBITDA for three quarters was about RUB700 million, so is it an additional RUB1.2 billion, or the total for the year will be RUB1.2 billion negative EBITDA?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Company Representative [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No, that's not correct. RUB1.2 billion will not be an additional hit on the 4Q EBITDA. RUB700 million of that amount has already been included in the nine months EBITDA that we have reported, and the balance, the remaining amount is in fact below OIBDA. So it's already in our net profit for the nine months and it's already in, so there won't be any effect on Tajikistan on the fourth quarter.But the RUB700 million effect is in the nine months and that is together with the explanations that I've given on the distribution on the shift of OIBDA of a major project to 2017, so that combined gives the difference of RUB2 billion versus the business plan, and in order to exclude the effect on the cash flow, we had a mirror action on our CapEx.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Semenov, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you, understood. Also if you could clarify the reasons as to why you have decided to move interest from investment cash flow to financial cash flow?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Company Representative [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor, a very simple answer; we just followed IFRS standards. So previously we used GAAP and now we use IFRS, so we just followed the IFRS guidance here. There is no special reason, there is no business need for that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) (Operator Instructions) Roman Arbuzov, UBS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Roman Arbuzov, UBS - Analyst [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) My first question is about CapEx. What's your view on CapEx going forward and whether you are comfortable with the return on your investments and is there any -- are there any opportunities for optimizing your CapEx? And also if you do that, how do you intend to maintain the technological leadership that you have mentioned?And my second question is about the competition in the market. So you have mentioned that the competition is irrational, specifically in distribution, so it would be interesting to know do you see even today any real steps for the improvement of the competitive environment or are we still at the level of signals or some prerequisites for the -- for some future change or is your confidence in the change in the markets growing?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Sergey Soldatenkov will handle your question. Let me participate in answering your question and thank you Roman for your question. Regarding CapEx, we are quite reasonable human beings and today as we see it CapEx is an instrument for strategy. We often overlook that, yes, we are a technology industry, so we have to maintain a certain level of CapEx to increase the traffic capability, to improve the quality of services et cetera, but we perfectly understand that if revenue doesn't grow we understand that maintaining the levels of CapEx at the level of last year, even this year will not be -- will not be reasonable.Obviously, we can't share any numbers, but we see that next year we'll be seeing a reduction in CapEx. Even if CapEx goes down, in our strategy we will still plan for different clusters in the digital fields in which have the most number of subscribers. So we will maintain our CapEx level to implement our digital strategy.As for your second question, the competition in the markets, whether there's any real improvement such as signals, I think that all players understand very clearly where we are going and where we will end up in two or three years. I think that they understand it very clearly. And whether that has already started, I don't think it has yet, because just recently our competitor Tele2 launched free calls to other networks, although they do say that this promo will only last until the New Year, but it demonstrates that each operator pursues their own agenda, but we say that we will not be participating in price wars. In terms of bundled tariff, we want to have conditional rather than unconditional bundled offers. We are working on that and we think that the competition is looking at that too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Roman Arbuzov, UBS - Analyst [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. And conditional bundled offers, what do you mean, can you please comment?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What does that mean, that means if a person spends a certain amount, (inaudible) continues. That's when you have an unlimited offer, but we can -- also additional services which help us earn. Currently there will be a bundle.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just to -- just going back to this question about the reversal of the bonuses and more maybe general question, is it based on a change in the management compensation and if that is true, maybe you could just elaborate a bit what the management compensation will be based on going forward? Yes, that's about it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Company Representative [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The answer is very simple. Within the personnel expense, i.e., physical personal expense that we run on monthly basis, there is an additional every month -- every month we accrue additional portion of a provision of -- that explains the likelihood of overall management and all employees, the likelihood of being compensated if the target for this particular year are achieved.So every month up until -- this is ninth month, September, we allocate this accrual on the basis that the probability is medium. When we approach to the September we have more visibility on the year-end numbers and the probability of achieving or not achieving certain targets that were established. Now today we see that the business plan and the targets for MegaFon are less probable in terms of achievement and we reverse the accruals that have been made during the past nine months.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, so it has nothing to do with the change (inaudible)?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Company Representative [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That's absolutely correct. It doesn't have -- doesn't lead to more capital change.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Understood. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse - Analyst [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good question on strategy update and the dividend policy update that you mentioned in the beginning of the call. In terms of dividend policy are you planning to time it together early next year? And maybe if you can elaborate at least conceptual thinking of the new dividend policy?And second question, you've sort of elaborate a little bit on your competition, if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how you view current price changes in the market by your competitors and [GS] some marginal changes by VimpelCom as well?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Sergey Soldatenkov is handling your question. I will try to handle that question, Olga. We are not showing any specific steps of our new strategy, but at the same time we are working to update our dividend policy, and from our recent meetings I have a very clear understanding of investor expectations in terms of the dividend policy.Indeed, as you know, twice a year we pay dividends and although we need to understand whether the shareholders will approve, I understand that it could be misleading for you and we'll try to work on that, we will try to make it more certain, but so far it's premature to talk about it because we will be discussing that at the Board of Directors.If I understand correctly your second question what is our understanding of competitor actions in terms of the rates and plans, I will reiterate that each of the competitors make their own steps, some upwards, some downwards, that includes national roaming. Unfortunately considering an increase of international roaming tariff, that's not just our wish, that's also what the European Union is making us to do essentially. So there may be upwards moves as well. It's important that everybody understands that that is the right approach sometimes. And Vlad will add on that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you Sergey. I would like to add a couple of words on the price completion. We apparently are not in support of price wars. However, we operate in a market and we watch very attentively every move that our competitors make.But we do have our own commercial policy. We have our own marketing policies, so I don't think you could expect from us the mirroring or repetition of what the competitors make. We may have totally asymmetric responses, but we are also concerned about the monetization of the services that we'll provide and we will make every effort to ensure that it wasn't just monetization through simply increasing prices, but also through increasing customer value. So I would really be thinking in terms of new services and better customer experience. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Editor [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portions of this transcript that are marked (interpreted) were spoken by an interpreter present on the live call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dmitry Kononov, Director of Investor Relations and M&A. Please go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dmitry Kononov, MegaFon PAO - Director for IR & M&A [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our Board of Directors and management, welcome to MegaFon's investors and analyst call dedicated to financial results for the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2016. With that, please allow me to introduce participants on our side; our CEO, Sergey Soldatenkov; our CFO, Gevork Vermishyan; our COO, Anna Serebryanikova, Chief Commercial Officer, Vlad Wolfson, Director of Accounting and Reporting, Gagik Grigoryan and myself as Director of IR and M&A.Before beginning our discussion, I must remind you that some statements made on this call relating to future events, conditions or circumstances may be considered forward-looking statements. By their very nature, forward-looking statements may involve uncertainties that could cause the outcome of matters covered by such forward-looking statements to be different from the outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We give no assurance that the outcomes anticipated by such forward-looking statements will occur and expressly disclaim any obligations to update such forward-looking statements. We allocated one hour for this call to present four agenda items and to answer any of your questions. Key highlights for 2016 will be presented by our CEO, Mr. Soldatenkov. Network infrastructure development, shared services developments, update on first our Company, network and connectivity improvements, and 4G developments will be presented by our COO. Commercial developments will be presented by our Chief Commercial Officer, Vlad Wolfson; financial results, liquidity, balance sheet, and outlook for 2017 will be presented by our CFO, Gevork Vermishyan. With that, I'm turning over to Mr. Soldatenkov.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very happy to welcome you on our call to present MegaFon's results for 2016. I will now discuss the year's key highlights as well as our key initiatives and projects and my colleagues will then follow with a detailed discussion of our operating and financial results.I'm happy to report that despite a highly competitive environment in the Russian market, MegaFon was able to deliver on its three key targets of 2016, that is revenue, OIBDA, and CapEx. The growing pressure from tough competition -- during the year, we had to reduce prices for services while increasing spending on both subscriber acquisition and retention and network development. Thus MegaFon's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 closely reflect the market situation. Our consolidated net revenue remained broadly flat year-on-year at RUB316 billion. The growth in data revenue slowed down and our OIBDA margin declined to 38.3%. In this uncertain environment, we took a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening our current market position and which we hope will have a positive effect on our financial performance going forward.Read MoreWe shifted our focus away from continuing to aggressively build our subscriber base and made it our priority to ensure existing customer loyalty by improving the customer care quality and delivering customer value. We believe at present, the prices for certain mobile services are at their lowest economically viable levels that substantially limits their monetization potential. That is why at the end of December [2016], we made a decision to introduce limits in those of our plans that had previously been unlimited and to revamp our bundled offerings. Last year, we continued implementing a number of important projects aimed at improving our operating efficiency such as the unified billing that we have mentioned already, the Shared Services Center; an update on these will be presented by my colleagues in particular by Anna Serebryanikova.Our signature event for the period was the acquisition of a controlling voting stake in Mail. Ru Group. The transaction was closed in early February this year, receiving an overwhelming support from our shareholders. This step will enable us to transform our business and evolve from a mobile operator into an integrated digital communications company. The acquisition will also enable us to jointly with Mail. Ru develop brand new products and services for our customers, which will combine mobile data and digital technology capabilities. We hope that these services will open a new chapter in the history of both MegaFon and hopefully the entire telecom market in Russia.In 2016, we remained committed to ensuring regular distributions to our shareholders. In December 2016, the EGM approved the dividends in the amount of RUB15 billion. Thus, total dividend for 2016 amounted to RUB50 billion, which is in line with the 2015 amount. I'm also pleased to report that in March this year, MegaFon was chosen as an official provider of telecom infrastructure and additional services at all locations for the events of the FIFA 2017 Confederations Cup and FIFA 2018 World Football Cup. MegaFon will carry out construction, preparation, and operation of all engineering and telecom infrastructure at all locations for the international sports events. MegaFon will build test 5G zones and will offer guests and teams super-high speed mobile Internet and high quality network coverage.I would also like to mention that we are in the final stages of creating a new development strategy for the next three to five years including a review of how we approach our distribution network. We hope to be able to present the updated strategy at a dedicated event at the end of May. That is it from my side and with this, I'm turning over to Anna Serebryanikova, our COO.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Serebryanikova, MegaFon PAO - COO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Sergey. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I will start with a short update on the key projects which allow us to increase our operating efficiency. In 2016, we continued to implement our unified billing system project, which will, upon completion, replace legacy billing systems which we have currently in all our branches. Unified billing project will allow us to decrease the time to market and to make targeted offers to our customers in an efficient way. The unified technical solution is based on an open architecture with capacity to further scale up and expand the system going forward. In 2016, we achieved significant progress in rolling this system. We are start sales of our B2C mobile customers and B2B sales in more than 200 our retail stores across the country. Improvements of implementation process have already resulted in [shorter terms] of launch and rollout of new products.Turning to the next slide, it's another project we are proud of. In July 2016, we launched our Shared Services Center, which is aimed at optimization and unification of our back office functions including accounting, financial control, treasury, procurement planning, logistics, HR, and some others. This will in turn enhance our business scalability. We have opened a fully controlled Shared Services Center in Samara and we are currently in the process of transferring all branch offices and all our subsidiaries to this center and intend to finish this process by the end of 2017. As of now, three of eight our branches and six subsidiaries are already working from the Shared Services Center. Upon completion in 2018, we intend to start providing services to third parties, our B2B clients, which will generate additional revenue for our Company.Turning to the next slide, as you remember, in September 2016, the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders approved the spin-off of MegaFon's towers into a standalone company, First Tower Company. MegaFon plans to transfer more than 15,000, almost 16,000 this year towers to the tower company. Through this, we will create a market player with the best tower portfolio in Russia, simultaneously MegaFon will improve its operating efficiency via focused management of this tower portfolio. We expect to achieve a better return on CapEx and incremental gains from active involvement in a tower leasing market. You can see the key project implementation stages on this slide. The first stage is the actual spin-off of the tower infrastructure and related assets to the tower company, which is expected to be completed in summer 2017. According to our current plans, the First Tower Company will be ready for sale in 2019.On the next slide, I'd like to share our results in the network infrastructure development. We remain focused on improving the coverage and quality of our mobile telecommunications network, further network rollout and modernization. We also strengthened our fiber optic infrastructure, which supports further rollout of our mobile network. Our fiber optic infrastructure is the largest network among Russian mobile operators. During the year, the total number of base stations of all types increased by 9% year-on-year and exceeded 143,000 base stations. Also, the number of 3G and 4G stations grew by 16% to almost 76,000. Through organic construction and modernization of our network, we increased the total length of our fiber optic network by 5% to more than 190,000 kilometers and increased the percentage of base stations connected via fiber to 65%. We also entered into long-term leases on fiber optic lines in order to provide our customers in hard-to-reach regions in the Far East with high-quality services.On the next slide, you see the improving of the results of our activities on improvement of quality of connections and provided services for our clients. This is our key focus. During the year, we identified the needs of our subscribers in terms of network quality throughout the number of user satisfaction surveys and analysis of customer requests to contact centers. As a result, we introduced a key quality indicator system. We implemented serious solution additions to our GNOC facilities. In particular, we upgraded management and monitoring systems used at our GNOC and also adopted the performance management system which is aimed at registering usage and quality metrics of provided services.During the year, we continued to introduce solutions adding new functionality to our radio access network and optimized the parameters of backhaul network sections to improve the end-to-end quality metrics of our services. In 2016, we introduced the RAN Quality of Service technology, which enables a better distribution of 3G and 4G network resources among subscribers and services depending on the type of service. We implemented LTE 1800 as an additional layer and also continued to develop other layers depending on our customers' needs and regional situation. I'm also proud to say that MegaFon was the first operator in Russia who launched the full-fledged commercial voice over LTE network. It enables us to provide our subscribers so far in Moscow with high quality of voice services and faster call setup, reduced [cost] of Internet sessions when making a call via the LTE network and we plan to continue this rollout in 2017. All the efforts undertaken in 2016 allowed us to improve key connectivity quality metrics, seriously reduce the dropped call rates and increase the call setup success rate.A few words on the 4G network developments of the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we remained focused on the development of our 4G network infrastructure to maintain high-quality and high-speed of mobile Internet connections. As of the end of the year, the 4G network included more than 30,000 base stations. Our 4G services are available now in 82 regions of Russia while services of high-speed Internet LTE-Advanced are available in 27 cities and regions. The amount of 4G traffic generated in the fourth quarter increased by 60% year-on-year and accounted to 46% of the total mobile data traffic. The increase in traffic was achieved due to our attractive offerings, active marketing promotions, and growth in the number of 4G devices registered in our network through more than 10 million units at the end of 2016. With this, I'm turning it over to Vlad Wolfson, our Commercial Director, who will talk about further development of the product. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you, Anna. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me update you on the performance of our digital services that are becoming increasingly popular as well as B2X segments in 2016. I will start with MegaFon TV. Over the year, MegaFon TV's audience more than doubled to 1.6 million users at the end of December. More than 70% of active MegaFon TV users also use one of our all-included bundles. These are our core tariff plans and approximately 80% of active MegaFon TV users use their smartphones or tablets to consume the content. MegaFon TV offers our subscribers access to over 130 TV channels and a vast HD content library from largest Russian copyright holders and content providers. For example in 2016, MegaFon TV users had the unique opportunity to access the premier content of CTC or SCS entertainment channel before it was available to the free-to-air viewers. We intend to continue this practice in 2017 as well. I'm happy to report also that in 2016, MegaFon had approximately 9% of paid OTT content market across the nation.On the next page, I would like to give you more color on our new MegaFon card in 2016. The card is currently available for our users across Russia. In the three months of operating at a federal level, over 400,000 cards were issued and [approximately quarter of] cardholders used the card actively for regular transactions. This is our key customer base. Total turnover at the end of 2016, that is essentially in the four last months of the year was approximately RUB2 billion. This testifies that MegaFon cardholders actively use the card for payments including for MegaFon services. As of today, total turnover is already in excess of RUB4 billion, which means that we were able in January, February 2017 to double the turnover. At the year-end, average monthly turnover per card was RUB11,000. We have launched the product only recently and our advertising campaign is currently ramping up, but we are satisfied with the initial result.Another new product of ours is in IoT. From December 2016, Russian consumer electronics retail stores and MegaFon's branded retail stores in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and [near Catherineberg, current devices] under the new Life Control brand. Life Control is a unique ecosystem of devices in several product ranges: Smart Home, Fitness, and Geo-tracking. The system is developed by our subsidiary MegaLabs and includes a wide range of sensors that can be combined for individual solutions. MegaFon offers an affordable starter kit of devices that can be supplemented by other Life Control devices and later by devices from other vendors as well. All sensors are plug-and-play. The system is controlled through a mobile app available for iOS and Android smartphones. I'm confident that in a few years time the Life Control gadgets will become a household essential much as smartphones are today for modern people.In the next page, we will discuss the B2X segment development in 2016. The B2X segment continued to demonstrate strong operating and financial performance. Total B2X customers grew by 7% year-on-year and reached almost 300,000 legal entities while the number of B2X mobile users grew by a record 20% and exceeded 10 million. Total B2X segment revenue was up by 8% while B2X mobile revenue was up by 6%, higher than the mobile revenue growth rate across the Group. According to TMT Consulting, in 2016, MegaFon ranked second in B2X mobile revenue with a market share of 33.3%. Going forward, MegaFon is looking to move from competing on price to competing on quality of services. Over 2016, we completed and initiated several large and important projects in [B2C] and B2G segments. We signed a contract with GLONASS satellite navigation system to act as a full-MVNO partner. We started a project together with Rosseti national power grid company to install in 300,000 power stations intrusion monitoring and telemetry systems.In 2016, MegaFon provided comprehensive telecommunications and engineering support services for two major events, the Russia-ASEAN forum in Sochi in May and at the Confederation Cup Russia Draw Procedure, part of the preparation for the 2018 Football World Cup. I'm also pleased to report that MegaFon won the tender and signed a contract with Russian Federal Treasury to ensure broadband and mobile communications services. One of our focuses in 2016 continued to be M2M and as a result, our M2M subscribers were some 3.9 million SIM cards, which made MegaFon take some 40% of the market. We implemented the unique functionality of geo-tracking and new HR and car fleet monitoring technology. We also were the first in Russia to pilot test the narrowband IoT. With that, I'm turning it over to our CFO, Gevork. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will start with traditional overview of our earnings trends in fourth quarter and full-year 2016. Our total consolidated revenue for fourth quarter totaling RUB81 billion, decreased by 0.8% year-over-year. Revenue was impacted by 3.8% decline in wireless revenue as a result of decrease of traditional voice services. However, we continue to see strong growth in revenue from sales and equipment which increased more than 28% and we also saw stabilization of growth rates in wireline revenue in fourth quarter where revenue was up by 1% though it is important to highlight that fixed revenue in B2X demonstrated on a yearly basis [solely double-digit performance]. On an annual basis, our consolidated revenue was up 0.9%, which is completely in line with the guidance. OIBDA wise, in fourth quarter, our OIBDA declined by 1.6% year-over-year to RUB29 billion. Our OIBDA for the full-year 2016 totaled RUB121 billion which was also above our full-year guidance.I would like to stress out that we reported adjusted OIBDA, which is presented net of non-cash impairment charge in the amount of RUB3.4 billion relating to the goodwill allocated to the broadband Internet CGU which is NetByNet. Our adjusted OIBDA margin in Q4 was down by [0.3%] year-over-year, it came down to 35.7% while full-year OIBDA margin achieved 38.3%. Our net income decreased by 42.3% in the quarter and it was largely because of this RUB3.4 million non-cash impairment that I mentioned before and elevated D&A. Important to say that the adjusted net income for this NetByNet impairment shows over 20% increase on a quarterly basis.Next slide, the fourth quarter is traditionally a quarter with [higher CapEx] numbers as you know, this year was not an exception. In Q4 2016, we spent [approximately third] of our annual CapEx budget and as a result, succeeded in delivering on our full-year targets as well. Our actual CapEx 2016 came to RUB65.6 billion, which is [RUB2.4 billion] below the upper range of the full-year guidance. It's important to say that despite this decrease in CapEx, we've completed all natural KPIs in our technical plan of development and strong ruble helped us to deliver lower CapEx. Meantime, our unlevered free cash flow on a quarterly basis was up 2.1%.On the next slide, I will speak about revenue components. Q4 2016 wireless revenue was down 3.8% mainly as a result of continued contraction in voice. Due to growing popularity of bundled tariffs, which were revised in spring last year in response to the market competitive pressures and increasing number of subscribers using mobile Internet and shifting to digital technologies as a result of growing popularity of messages and OTT services. Our mobile data continued to be one of the largest contributors to total revenue with a share of more than 26%. The growth rates in mobile data stabilized and were standing at 1.9% in Q4 2016. We saw a continuing upward trend in data user base, which increased 5.8% to 31 million customers.Fixed line segment continued to perform well, but stabilized in fourth quarter at 1%, but as I said, one of the reason was -- I will say that one of the reason was equalization of comparable base. In 2015, there was an non-organic portion of GARS revenue. And it's important to say that on the annual basis, the fixed revenue is showing good results. Sales of handsets and accessories continued to show strong growth rates, increased 28%. The revenue in this segment benefited from higher demand from more expensive and high-end devices, which were marketed along with attractive bundled offerings. The average price of data-enabled devices sold in our MegaFon retail stores has increased by 85%.Few words about the customer base on the second slide. As said, previously it has increased by 1%, reached 75.6 million users. At the same time, our data user base continued to increase at a healthy rate of 5.8% on the back of higher adoption of data mobile devices coupled with our data offerings within bundled tariffs. Our data user base now accounts for almost 41% overall subscriber base compared to 39% a year ago.Now, I would like to give you an update on our KPIs. The expansion of data user base, higher data allowances increased sales of data-enabled devices and further development of our network allowed us to increase data usage per customer to more than five gigs per month in Q4 2016, which is increasingly high, 39% higher than the year ago. Despite higher data usage, our data ARPU decreased 4.2% year-on-year due to lower price per megabyte, an increasing share of users choosing bundled tariffs with higher data allowances. Profitability wise, which is on the next slide, adjusted OIBDA, net of non-cash impairment charge has decreased by 1.6% year-on-year. The key reason was the decline in gross profit by 3.3% as a result of the increased cost of services mainly attributable to higher sales of equipment and accessories, which posted strong growth rates and accounted for 10% of the total revenue versus 8% year ago. The increase in cost of services was partially offset by lower SG&A costs.Sales and marketing expenses have been under control, they decreased this quarter 5.4% due to lower advertising spend and smarter dealership spend. G&A costs were down 5.2% due to lower employee benefits and social charges, they went down 11.5% and decreased radio frequency fees by 25.7%. As a result of change of Roskomnadzor methodology relating to frequency charge calculation, which was introduced in late 2015. Few words about our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, our leverage stood at 1.63 times [net debt-to-EBITDA] mainly as a result of the increase in long-term portion of total debt and lower OIBDA 2016. We believe our leverage remains at the upper-end of acceptable range. Over one quarter, we continue to increase the portion of cash held in USD in order to mitigate the risks associated with the execution of our foreign exchange denominated liabilities. So this portion grew from [83%] to 92% sequentially. Here, I'm glad to say that our debt structure and leverage led to an upgrade of the outlook on Russian sovereign rating by Moody's from negative to stable. On next slide, you see our debt portfolio structure as well as of the year-end. As you may see, over one year, we have managed to significantly redesign the structure of our debt portfolio to mitigate risks associated with this refinancing and repayment.Now, over 90% of our debt portfolio is denominated in rubles, matching our revenue mix, significantly extended average portfolio life, now approximately half of our debt becomes due payable in five years or later, which is a comfortable situation. In early 2017, we continued to optimize our debt. In February, we signed an agreement with Sberbank, a total amount of RUB35 billion with a maturity in 2024. The funds and the proceeds were used to finance the purchase of economic interest in Mail. Ru. With this agreement, we also modified terms under three existing facilities, [jumbo] facility totaling RUB97 billion including lower interest rates and revised early repayment terms. Following that, in March this year 2017, we executed a partial refinancing of the existing ruble debt facility with Alfa-Bank and UniCredit, a total amount of RUB15 billion and also managed to significantly reduce interest rates and extend maturity.The conclusive slide in my presentation speaks about guidance traditionally. We expect our revenue to be flat or low-single digit growth rate in 2017. We also anticipate our adjusted OIBDA to be in the range of RUB112 billion to RUB118 billion and the decline in OIBDA will be offset by a reduced CapEx guidance, which now stands in the range of RUB55 billion to RUB60 billion as opposed to RUB65.6 billion demonstrated in 2016.It is important to refresh here that this forecast represent standalone numbers, they don't include financial results of Mail. Ru and financial forecasts, but based on Mail. Ru guidance, they expect a standalone revenue in 2017 to grow 16% to 19%, between RUB49.6 billion and RUB50.9 billion and they expect their OIBDA margin to be around 42%. Our guidance is intentionally conservative on OIBDA reflecting the uncertainties in the current environment and does not take into account synergies from Mail. Ru transaction nor any potential recovery in the market conditions. Thank you very much. With this, let's open Q&A session.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have three questions and all of them about the guidance please. The first one is about your revenue guidance, I think I just saw the interview, which Mr. Soldatenkov gave and he said 3.5% service revenue growth. So if you could confirm that this revenue guidance which you are giving of course includes the handsets as well and it's indeed 3.5% service, is that what you are expecting and I guess that is meaning that reduction on the equipment sales.Number two is vis-a-vis your CapEx, if you could give us a bit of color on how much of that is driven by FX again and how much of that, so to say, real reduction in the CapEx, if I may qualify so to say, real reduction in the CapEx and what is the main, so to say, purpose of this CapEx in any case, is it mostly coverage, is it mostly transport, where does it go?And lastly, on your [EBITDA] again, mostly recurring again to interview of Mr. Soldatenkov where he suggested that the Euroset could be split between yourself and VimpelCom possibly even within a month and I think as you mentioned, this [EBITDA] doesn't include any external, so to say, factors, but if you would consider for instance indeed the split of Euroset happening, how would that change your guidance for instance, could you give us a bit of color on that? Thank you very much.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Alex, thank you for your question. Let me start with question number three about the potential split of Euroset, this question is handled by Sergey Soldatenkov. We wouldn't want to comment on this. So when we are prepared to make a statement, we will let you know, we will update the market.As for your other questions, indeed, yes, earlier today, there was a press conference and I was given an interview and it wasn't 3.5%, but it was rather 3% to 5% that we are seeing for next year, not for 2017. 2017, we believe to be a year of stabilization when the focus on the development of our base will help us overcome the switching over of subscribers from our older tariff plans to the newer ones. So, next year is where we expect to see growth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Second question, with respect to the CapEx guidance here, straight answer to your question would be that the FX rate as we have in the business plan, which is the basis for building up the guidance on CapEx has zero impact on the difference numbers. So a fixed noise is absolutely omitted here. In reality, the structure of the CapEx easily it will be changing year-on-year in 2017 versus 2016, not dramatically, but still it is being changed. First and foremost, our investment governance prescribes that capital allocation are getting only those projects, which bear higher ROIC and we focus on that. So it is easy for us having set a monitory target for investments in next year to prioritize the investment projects, which will be put into gear.Secondly, when the standard technology is developing and on the back of heavy LTE investments over the past years, we feel base case as part of the investment budget shall not bear that much of 2G coverage kind of CapEx than it used to have in previous years. So basically, these are explanations why we believe that RUB5 billion to RUB10 billion decrease is acceptable and not risky and of course, that anticipates that should forex misbehave and ruble pop up [to 100], then obviously we would have a problem and we would come to the market explain and revise.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alex Kazbegi, Renaissance Capital - Analyst [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay understood, can I go back to this [EBITDA] guidance question, I understand it's all speculative about whether the split happens or not, but just to say it would happen, would that warrant revision of the guidance or not really.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------One of the disclaimers given in the guidance traditionally is that when we are making the guidance, we put into it the information, the management has at the point of giving this guidance. That's why now non-organic M&A, you don't see a Mail. Ru numbers in here nor you see any potential impacts of M&A transactions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Roman Arbuzov, UBS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Roman Arbuzov, UBS - Analyst [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much for taking the question. My first was actually a follow up on Alex's question around the [EBITDA] guidance, it feels somewhat more conservative and as he opened, say it is conservative, but I was just wondering is there anything, you made clear Euroset is not there, but is there anything else that maybe making it more conservative potentially, so things like Tajikistan, we saw some one-offs last year, we also saw historically some volatility with expenses coming from the long-term incentive program. So maybe there are a few things that are on your mind that can pop up in 2017. So if you could please just give us maybe a little bit more color, that will be very helpful.And then my second question is just on the dividends and so, obviously, it's a Board decision and you are limited in what you can say, but maybe you can comment on the dividends from the perspective of what you think the company can actually afford as opposed to what actually happens in terms of your ability to pay, you've mentioned that you are now probably towards the higher-end of the leverage range in terms of where you want to be.And also, you're talking about your [EBITDA] being down mid-single digits or potentially even worse in 2017. So with that in mind, do you think we're still in the times of when MegaFon can afford to pay out more in dividends than the cash flow that it makes as you have been doing for the last two years or do you think we should really be thinking as 100% of cash flow is sort of the top-end of where you should realistically be in terms of the dividend or potentially even lower to maybe have some deleveraging. I appreciate you are limited in terms of what you can say precisely here, but just some discussion on your ability to pay dividends, that will be helpful, thank you very much--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, you're right Roman, we are indeed limited in discussing the dividends. I think the only points that I can mention here is that, we of course talk freely to the sell side, we of course talk to buy side and we understand what are the areas of concern of the existing dividend policy, which was introduced prior to IPO back in 2012 on different market conditions and different times. So we understand that we need to add more transparency to this dividend policy and more predictability to the dividend policy.This is absolutely certain and this is work-in-progress today. Sometime later during this year, presumably in April, you will hear the Board's recommendation, so it's not long to wait and also we need to say that we promised to you that the strategy session will be held in format of Capital Market Day at the end of May and this Capital Market Day and strategy discussion obviously would have to be followed by an announcement of the concept of new dividend policy that this strategy can deliver. That's all I can say on the dividends.With respect to the first question, let's put it this way, so you see our revenue guidance, which is flat to single-digit growth rate, you also understand the inflationary pressures that the direct costs and the operational costs have in the P&L. You also hopefully recall that we are really striving and making cost management exercises on a daily basis and the good testament for that is fourth quarter OIBDA which came in absolute terms more or less flattish, but in reality, the guidance message that I'm trying to send to the market is that the market environment is still uncertain, the OIBDA guidance extrapolates the trend we previously saw with half rate dynamics. So I mean, we decelerate the decline trend in OIBDA, which is already something good achievement and any potential shortfall of OIBDA between the years is covered by and offset by CapEx to stabilize cash flows.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Herve Drouet, HSBC.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Herve Drouet, HSBC - Analyst [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, good afternoon. Thank you again as well for taking my questions. First question is trying to get your view on the data services, data ARPU which you know have been down. Do you see any room to start to improve those data ARPU looking forward, I mean, is it more matter of how the competition is going to do in certain regions or I mean do you feel that there is more to be monetized especially considering the [cheap] data pricing you got. So, I just wanted to get a bit of your view on what you think how promotions will evolve especially this year and where do you see competitions moving in terms of tariff and packages. And the second thing is again back to Euroset, can you tell us so far what prevented it to split Euroset between you and VimpelCom, what are the main hurdle that prevents you to do it and not to have already done it. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Vlad Wolfson, [will answer] your question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you. I will tackle your question regarding tariffs and tariff plans. You can see in our documents, the numbers that we announced and published demonstrating the data usage is significantly growing and it's over 5 GB per user in the fourth quarter. So that's approximately 40% growth and we can see that data ARPU is going down. So responding to your question whether there is any reason to believe that this could be changed, we do believe that this situation should start to turnaround in 2017. MegaFon has discontinued unlimited tariff plans for our users in our new sales. We believe this will help us to more accurately offer our services to our users and to monetize the traffic that we can see growing in our network. Thank you. And Sergey Soldatenkov is handling your question on Euroset.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) I would like to say once again to remind you that we are not commenting this today about any challenges of the splits. Please give us more time, we will get back to you when we are prepared to tell you about the potential split of Euroset. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good evening, two questions please. Firstly, can you update us on the data storage law. What are the latest developments, what are your latest expectations or what's the timeline -- any color you can give us on that would be very helpful and secondly, Gevork, if we understood you correctly, you said the leverage is now indeed at the upper-end of the acceptable range. So, is it so? Did you get it right, first and second, if it is so, that probably it means that the dividends will have to come down even though I understand that the dividend push is something to consider later on, but there are just some general guidelines here, which means that if you are at the upper-end of your comfortable leverage level than you have to [cap] the dividends. Any thoughts on this will be very helpful, thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Serebryanikova, MegaFon PAO - COO [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Ivan, this is Anna, I will take the first question on data storage. In terms of moving the timeline, which is now in the law, we don't see such indications currently, but what we see is that -- now you know the issue is within the government and we hope that the government has realized the potential negative impact to the industry of the full scale implementation of the law. So I think that there may be some positive developments in terms of duration of the storage and the pre-filtering systems. That's all I can say. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(inaudible - microphone inaccessible).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Serebryanikova, MegaFon PAO - COO [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think that in order to be able to implement the law, we need at least 10 to 12 months. So we don't have more time than summer. So I think that the government also understands that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan, yes, Gevork here again. On the leverage, we demonstrate 1.6 times leverage as of year-end. Post announcement events or post-subsequent events as you appreciate and know was a Mail. Ru transaction which obviously took the leverage up -- standalone MegaFon leverage up to two times. Of course, optically starting from first quarter this year going further would really show very nice leverage metrics as we consolidate Mail. Ru operations and sites, but understanding that this is an Internet company and our economic strategy is [15%] there, we think we have to be not sort of giving ourselves a free ride as a result of Mail. Ru consolidation into any discussions about leverage and dividend policy.And I know that I probably don't speak very pronounced on sending an pronounced messages on exact dividend policy but I urge you to wait a little bit until we give the privilege of dividend policy adoption to our Board of Directors. What I'm trying to say is that on a standalone basis, leverage metrics are a little bit elevated to my opinion and does not on one hand create any problems with respect to fundamental stability and financial stability of the Company since our corporate finance activities and fund raising activities and ability to manage that is at very high level. So we borrow cheap and we borrow long and we have very nice and comfortable amortization profile, but the carrying cost of debt has an impact on our free cash flow and the more you sort of see our standalone leverage, the more leverage that you have is declining. So we need to find a nice balance between fundamental value of the Company, capital allocation through dividends and prudent credit metrics, which we will do and communicate to the market sometime very soon.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(inaudible) Goldman Sachs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Participant [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Thank you for the presentation. I have a couple of questions, do you have more understanding about your interaction with Mail. Ru and can you perhaps share something about this even now, when can we expect any joint projects.And my second question is whether you see any potential for CapEx reduction in absolute terms in 2017 or will CapEx not go down in mid-term to long-term. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) So, since you're asking in Russian, I will be happy to answer in the Russian as well. In terms of interaction with Mail. Ru, certainly for us this is a very good transaction in terms of our differentiation, our digital strategy differentiation. As colleagues have mentioned, we'll be telling you more about this when we announce our strategy later this year, but even today, we can see two areas that are currently quite obvious for us and these are big data exchange that we will be launching very soon and the VKmobile project.We will also be presenting them separately. We have other sources of synergy we will be telling you about it later because it's hard to be telling you about something that we have thought about, but not yet implemented and good work continues in terms of our CapEx guidance, we can only limit ourselves to the yearly guidance, but the main reason why this annual guidance is going down and hopefully not just for us, but across the industry. So we believe that you can use it with good probability, but according our rules, we only guide for one year. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS - Analyst [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, thank you very much and I'm not sure which language is more appropriate. I will ask in English. In terms of further integration of [the quantum] after the acquisition of Mail. Ru, are you comfortable to expand your integration in content, in particular, if we take a look on your presentation, you highlighted you have provided premium access to your subscribers of MegaFon TV to the product of CTC Media, is there any chances that you might be looking at providing a stake in the company or in a related company?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Serebryanikova, MegaFon PAO - COO [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I can also take this question. First, we do not -- we never speak about potential M&A deals. Second, we do not think that the only way to make a successful partnership is by acquisition. We think that -- and we are now learning quite successfully that we can do partnerships not only by acquisition. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Libin, Raiffeisen BANK.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Libin, Raiffeisen BANK - Analyst [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello, thank you. So my question is whether you could share your estimates on cost savings from moving to Shared Services Center and also new headquarters in Moscow and if it's in anyway reflected in your guidance?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, Sergey, this is Gevork. So without telling you the split year-on-year, I think this [SCS project carries as much as RUB470 million] savings overall and there explained as an arbitrage between the salaries in a low-cost and high-cost environment as well as in lease expenses. So the Shared Service Center effect is inside the business plan and therefore is within the guidance. The other question was with respect to the savings from HQ office right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Libin, Raiffeisen BANK - Analyst [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Well in reality, year-on-year or sequential comparison does not show and should not show any savings as a result of consolidation of offices. The case that we provided when we acquired a 50% stake or 49.9% stake in the company, owner of this real estate was the legally binding obligation to see which was signed in 2011-2012 to see at very high rates and very expensive walk away fee. Instead, we negotiated better deals in ruble terms, no FX, long-term, and less space and here we are. So the difference is a little bit, I mean there is savings, but between it's like a delta case between forecast and reality. So it's not factored into the guidance, it cannot be factored. We're going to move premises in two, three months and so up until that time, we will carry the double lease rents, but we're going to be still in the money for that particular investment.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Libin, Raiffeisen BANK - Analyst [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, but you assume that you stop paying rent for the old offices starting from say second half this year and you also included in the guidance, right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gevork Vermishyan, MegaFon PAO - CFO [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, if the question was about that, yes you're right, we're stopping paying rent here. We start paying rent there, but again, you need to understand that we're consolidating like five offices including low cost lease offices of NetByNet, MegaFon Retail, Stolichny branch and more probably more expensive headquarter MegaFon and we're moving to a RUB27,000 per square meter per annum. So there's not much of a saving as a result of that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse - Analyst [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, good evening. Thank you very much for the question. The first one is on your own distribution chain, you've said several times that you have plans to reduce the number of your own stores, if I'm not mistaken by about 30% per annum. So I just wanted to see if there's any progress on that and maybe you can share with us number of stores you currently have in your own distribution network.And the second question on pricing, you mentioned that you have amended prices for the new subscribers at the end of December. Do you see any opportunity for you or in Russia in general to change pricing for the existing subscribers one way or the other and if you do, how do you think that will develop and when? Thank you very much.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Soldatenkov, MegaFon PAO - CEO [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) Olga, thank you for your question. It's handled by Vlad Wolfsan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vlad Wolfson, MegaFon PAO - Chief Commercial Officer [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(interpreted) In terms of our changes in our distribution strategy, they do exist indeed. We have a program to reduce our own retail stores MegaFon Retail, but we do not disclose the numbers about what we've done so far and we'll decide whether we want to disclose it at the end of the first quarter this year. So whether we want to disclose it reporting on our first quarter results in terms of prices, I think the question consists of two parts, the price changes that we implemented in December and that you're referring to is our business as usual, this is ongoing work. We have looked into different markets studies and then also we take customer service to really see how much they're willing to pay and what they want to see in the tariff plans. So that's an ongoing regular work. In terms of the pricing for the existing subscribers, I think that's not possible in a direct manner, but we are constantly working on promoting new services to the existing customer base and often due to the new product, we are capable of increasing the average sales per user.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It appears there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Dmitry Kononov for any additional or closing remarks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dmitry Kononov, MegaFon PAO - Director for IR & M&A [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Folks, we're about out of time. I thank you very much for participating with us on this call. As always, we're happy to take your questions either through direct calls or your emails and we look forward to hear from you when we discuss results for the first quarter of 2017. Thank you very much.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation, you may now disconnect.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Editor [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portions of this transcript that are marked (interpreted) were spoken by an interpreter present on the live call.

The unique Life Control ecosystem, which was developed by MegaLabs, includes a broad range of sensors that can be selected based on individual requirements.


The company is offering an affordable starter set of devices that can be added to with devices from Life Control and from other producers in future.


All the sensors are plug & play, meaning they are easy to connect and use.


The system is controlled through a mobile smartphone app available for iOS and Android.


        Starting 27 December 2016, devices produced under the Life Control brand will go on sale in Russian electronics shops, MegaFon stores and on the shelves of branded outlets. Life Control is a comprehensive ecosystem of affordable smart devices that are fully ready to connect and use instantly. The first devices are available in Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. They will work anywhere in the country.
      

        The Life Control system handles a whole range of tasks related to remote control of home systems and ensuring the security of a house or apartment. It includes a number of sensors to ensure the safe and efficient use of electrical appliances in the house. GPS trackers and fitness bracelets can also be connected to the system. The plan is to expand the range of devices and sensors available in future.
      

'Life Control is a brand new device ecosystem that encompasses several areas: Smart Home, Fitness and Geolocation. Thanks to its more than affordable price and also the reliability and convenience of using it to control the home, as well as its open architecture and the extensive range of use cases, we anticipate that Life Control will be a reliable assistant for most residents of the country. Today we are releasing reliable and useful devices from the Smart Home area on the market. I am confident that in the coming years Life Control gadgets will become a familiar element of any household, just like smartphones are today,' said Sergey Sobolev, Director of IoT Development at MegaLabs.


        The system is controlled through the site Lifecontrol.ru, as well as a mobile app for smartphones and tablets. Users remotely control the system, setting the parameters for devices themselves, as well as scenarios for how they work together. Information about important events is sent to users in real time as text message alerts, push notifications or emails.
      

        All that's needed for the system to work is the Smart Home Center (recommended retail price (RRP) 8,900 rubles), which, thanks to the fact it supports all communications protocols, accumulates information from all the sensors. All other devices can be chosen based on individual requirements and the configuration of their building.

Air quality sensor. Analyzes and reports carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compound (VOC) content in the air, as well as air temperature and humidity.
        

        Using the Life Control system makes it possible to react quickly to potential threats, remotely control electrical appliances and lighting, and track the location of children, pets or vehicles. Fitness trackers can also be connected into the ecosystem, accumulating information about their owner's physical activity and sleep.
      

        All devices have been tested in real-life conditions and have proven to be highly reliable. The Smart Home Center works using mobile internet so can be used in remote locations anywhere there is mobile reception, for example in an out-of-town house. It can also be used as a router for other internet devices.
      

        The Smart Home Center, as well as geo trackers, work using SIM cards from MegaFon, the Russian leader in the development of mobile-internet-based services. The operator has created a tariff specially tailored to how the Life Control system works.
      

        Depending on the number of options used and devices connected, the monthly fee for use of the Life Control system starts at 300 rubles. Use of the service is free until 1 April 2017.


'The new MegaLabs-developed product is undoubtedly the best value for money solution on the market. All leading global operators are showing an interest in similar systems. We are the first player on the Russian telecommunications market to launch a fully-fledged Smart Home ecosystem. Fast mobile internet from MegaFon makes it possible to play out a huge number of scenarios for using the system, from a simple text message about a sensor being activated through to high quality video streaming. Our network's broad coverage will ensure reliable functioning of the system anywhere in Russia,' said Yan Kukhalsky, New Business and Partnerships Director at MegaFon.


        The Life Control app can be downloaded from Google Play and the App Store. More information about the system can be found at lifecontrol.ru.

MegaLabs helps MegaFon win leading positions on adjacent markets (content and media, mobile finance, mobile ads, cloud solutions and others).
