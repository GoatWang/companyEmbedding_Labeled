HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. : A good buy now? Relative to peers, maybe. 
December 14, 2016 by CapitalCube 


Our analysis is based on comparing HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. with the following peers – Shaw Communications Inc. Class B, Sify Technologies Limited Sponsored ADR, Shenandoah Telecommunications Company and Sprint Corp. (SJR-US, SIFY-US, SHEN-US and S-US).
Relative Valuation
HKT Trust & HKT Ltd.’s price of USD 1.25 is lower than CapitalCube’s implied price of USD 1.91. CapitalCube believes that at these levels, HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. is undervalued and has upside potential. Over the last 52 week period, the stock has fluctuated between USD 1.17 and USD 1.63.


Company Overview

Considering peers, relative underperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a lagging position.


HKT Trust & HKT Ltd.’s current Price/Book of 1.91 is about median in its peer group.


We classify HKTTF-US as Harvesting because of the market’s relatively low growth expectations despite its relatively high returns.


HKTTF-US has relatively high profit margins while operating with median asset turns.


The company’s year-on-year change in revenues and earnings are better than the median among its peer group.


Over the last five years, HKTTF-US‘s return on assets has improved from median to better than the median among its peers, suggesting the company has found relative operating advantages.


The company’s relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.


While HKTTF-US‘s revenue growth in recent years has been above the peer median, the stock’s P/E ratio is less than the peer median suggesting that the company’s earnings may be peaking and the market expects a decline in its growth expectations.


The company is likely overinvesting in a business with only median returns.


HKTTF-US might have enough interest coverage to take-on additional debt prudently.


Investment Outlook
HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. has a fundamental score of 72 and has a relative valuation of UNDERVALUED. 
HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. is on the top left quadrant of the CapitalCube Value – Price Matrix. We classify this space a ‘Value Play’. Here, HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. is potentially undervalued, since it trades below its CapitalCube Implied Price of 1.91. At the same time, HKT Trust & HKT Ltd. is also fundamentally strong with a score of 72. This is a classic value stock definition.

Safety, Value Play, Value Trap, Speculative


Drivers of Valuation
HKTTF-US has a Harvesting profile relative to its peers.
We classify HKTTF-US as Harvesting because of the market’s low expectations of growth (P/E of 16.36 compared to peer median of 22.36) despite its relatively high returns (ROE of 11.78% compared to the peer median ROE of 6.65%).
The company’s current Price/Book of 1.91 is about median in its peer group.

Content of this website:

The content of this website has been prepared with the greatest possible care. However, LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG assumes no warranty for the accuracy, completeness or currentness of the content provided, particularly for price, market, exchange or other financial information. The prices displayed may vary significantly from the legally binding trading prices.

Lang & Schwarz TradeCenter AG & Co. KG will endeavor to offer the service on demand without any interruptions, as feasible. Even exercising all due diligence, however, downtime cannot be ruled out. LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG reserves the right to modify or discontinue its offerings at any time.
External links:

This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When incorporating the external links for the first time, LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG reviewed the third-party content for legal violations. At that point in time, no legal violations existed. LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG has no control whatsoever over the current and future design and content of the linked websites. The inclusion of external links does not signify that LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG has adopted the content referred to or linked as its own. Without specific indications of legal violations, LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG cannot be reasonably expected to continuously control these external links. However, should the company become aware of legal violations, the corresponding external will be deleted without delay.
No contractual relation:

By using the website of LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG, no contractual relation whatsoever comes about between the user and LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG. Hence, no contractual or quasi-contractual claims can arise against LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG. Should the use of the website nonetheless lead to a contractual relation, the following restriction of liability applies as a strictly precautionary measure: LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG shall be liable for intentional action and gross negligence and in the event of a breach of a material contractual duty. Limited to compensation for damage typically foreseeable upon the closing date of the contract, LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG shall be liable for damage based on any slightly negligent breach of material contractual duties by it or its legal representatives or vicarious agents. LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG shall not be liable in the event of a slightly negligent breach of ancillary duties that do not constitute material contractual duties. The liability for damage falling under the scope of protection of any representation or warranty issued by LANG & SCHWARZ Tradecenter AG & Co. KG and the liability for claims based on the Product Liability Act and damage based on injury to life, limb or health shall not be prejudiced hereby.

Explanation
The current ratio can give a sense of the efficiency of a company's operating cycle or its ability to turn its product into cash. Companies that have trouble getting paid on their receivables or have long inventory turnover can run into liquidity problems because they are unable to alleviate their obligations. Because business operations differ in each industry, it is always more useful to compare companies within the same industry.
Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry and are generally between 1 and 3 for healthy businesses.
The higher the current ratio, the more capable the company is of paying its obligations. A ratio under 1 suggests that the company would be unable to pay off its obligations if they came due at that point. While this shows the company is not in good financial health, it does not necessarily mean that it will go bankrupt - as there are many ways to access financing - but it is definitely not a good sign.
If all other things were equal, a creditor, who is expecting to be paid in the next 12 months, would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio means that the company is more likely to meet its liabilities which fall due in the next 12 months.
