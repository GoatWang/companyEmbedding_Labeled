中文摘要
子宮內膜異位症 (子宮內膜組織在子宮腔之外的地方增生)是一種常見的婦女疾病。子宮內膜異位症發生的成因很多也很複雜, 至今仍無一致的學說。子宮內膜異位症的形成過程與雌性激素的存在有高度相關性。雌性激素的作用是透過數種細胞生長因子促進細胞增長。目前已證實雌激素可以刺激正位子宮內膜組織表現纖維母細胞生長因子-9 (FGF-9)，並進而可以促進正位子宮內膜組織增生。由此可知FGF-9可能是促成子宮內膜異位症發生的成因之一。然而，FGF-9是透過何種細胞及分子機制去達成此作用目前仍不清楚。先前的研究也提出前列腺素E2 (PGE2) 的表現與子宮內膜異位症之嚴重度有高度的正相關性，腹膜液中過度表現的PGE2已證實是因異位組織及巨噬細胞過度表現前列腺素合成媒-2所造成。既然PGE2可以誘發固醇類賀爾蒙生成急性調控蛋白 (StAR) 及芳香環轉化脢 (aromatase)這兩個控制雌激素合成的基因的表現，我們合理的假設PGE2可能透過增加雌激素的合成進一步去誘發FGF-9的表現。所以本研究將主要探討PGE2如何作用去調控FGF-9。針對此目的，我將驗證以下兩個假說。 首先，異位基質細胞可以自行生成雌激素進而誘發 FGF-9的表現。接下來，PGE2可能促進異位基質細胞合成雌激素，而後進一步去誘發FGF-9的表現。實驗結果發現FGF-9及它的高親合性接受體FGFR2IIIc及FGFR3IIIc大量表現在異位內膜組織。若我們將細胞處理雌激素接受器的拮抗劑 (ICI 182,780)或是苯環酵素催化脢抑制劑 (4-hydroxyandrostenedione; 4-HA) 則會抑制異位基質細胞FGF-9表現，表示由異位內膜組織不正常表現之雌激素可以作用於異位內膜組織本身而促進FGF-9表現。相同的，另外我們也使用及ICI 182,780 以及4-HA去抑制細胞的增生，然而如此的抑制效果可藉由外給FGF-9而恢復。甚至，PGE2可以直接透過FGF-9促進異位基質細胞的增生表現，而此作用並不需要透過促進雌激素而達成。我們發現PGE2主要是透過與PGE2接受器EP3接合進而活化蛋白質磷酸化脢C- (PKC-)誘發FGF-9表現。PKC-進而活化細胞訊息傳遞因子ERK1/2 及轉錄因子Elk-1進而活化FGF-9轉錄表現。在FGF-9的促進子區域(-1324/-1329 及 -1046/-1051)各有一個轉錄因子Elk-1作用位置並由實驗證明對於PGE2誘發FGF-9表現具有關鍵性的意義。總而言之，我們是首度證實PGE2可以直接誘發FGF-9表現，並發現了一個新的訊息傳遞路徑:由PGE2藉由結合到其特異性接受器EP3後所活化之訊息傳遞分子PKC-，及ETS家族之轉錄因子Elk-1。總而言之，PGE2可以直接或間接透過FGF-9促進異位基質細胞的增生表現。就直接的途徑而言， PGE2是透過與EP3達成此作用; 而就間接的途徑而言，PGE2是透過促進雌激素而達成。PGE2可以藉由過度表現StAR及aromatase促進異位基質細胞合成雌激素。然而在生理上的意義，則是在人類動情週期中當卵巢雌激素表現很低時，異位內膜組織所不正常表現之雌激素可以藉由作用回異位內膜組織本身而誘發FGF-9及FGF-9接受器表現並進一步促進細胞增生以利於子宮內膜異位症之形成。雌激素誘發FGF-9表現可以增加異位內膜組織存活及生長以利於長期維持異位內膜異位症。我的研究發現對於PGE2作用在FGF-9所調控的胚胎發育及疾病，提供了一個重要的分子機制去解釋。進而針對過度表現環狀氧化脢(cyclooxygenase) 的疾病，亦可以依循此分子機制的脈絡用以發展治療及預防的方針。


英文摘要
Endometriosis, one of the commonest gynecological disorders, is defined as the presence of endometria-like tissues outside the uterine cavity. The etiology of endometriosis is complex and remains largely unknown. The progression of endometriosis is estrogen-dependent. However, estrogen rarely exerts direct growth effect but often mediates through peptide growth factors. Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) is reported as an estromedin in normal endometrium and acts as a mitogen for uterine endometrial stromal cells. It indicates FGF-9 is one of the potential candidates involving in the etiology of endometriosis. Nevertheless, cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of FGF-9 expression are mostly unknown. Previous study shows that concentration of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in peritoneal cavity is elevated due to aberrant expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in endometriotic tissue and peritoneal macrophage. Since PGE2 is a potent inducer for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and aromatase, two genes that control estrogen biosynthesis, it is reasonable to hypothesize that PGE2 might act through estrogen to regulate FGF-9. Therefore, this study aims to examine action of PGE2 on FGF-9 gene expression. Two hypotheses will be tested. First, FGF-9 is autonomously expressed by ectopic endometriotic stromal cell due to aberrant expression of estrogen. Second, PGE2 may stimulate FGF-9 gene expression possibly through increasing estrogen production in ectopic endometriotic stromal cells. Results reveal that FGF-9 and its high affinity receptors, FGF receptor 2IIIc (FGFR2IIIc), and FGF receptor 3IIIc (FGFR3IIIc), are effectively expressed by ectopic endometriotic tissues. In addition, expression of FGF-9 in ectopic endometriotic stromal cell is inhibited by treatment with ICI 182,780 (an estrogen receptor antagonist) and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (an aromatase inhibitor) indicating it is likely regulated by estrogen in an autocrine manner. Concordantly with these results, proliferation of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells is inhibited by treatment with ICI and is reversed by exogenous addition of recombinant FGF-9. Moreover, PGE2 can induce ectopic endometriotic stromal cells proliferation in a FGF-9-dependent manner. Further study reveals that PGE2-induced FGF-9 expression is independent of estrogen. I find that PGE2 induces FGF-9 expression through the EP3 receptor activated protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Activation of PKC leads to phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the transcription factor Elk-1 thereby promoting transcription of FGF-9. Two Elk-1 cis-binding sites locating at -1324/-1329 and -1046/-1051 of human FGF-9 promoter are identified to be crucial for mediating PGE2 actions. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that PGE2 can directly induce FGF-9 expression via a novel signaling pathway involving EP3, PKC and a member of ETS domain-containing transcription factor superfamily. Taken together, results from my current study demonstrate that PGE2 can induce FGF-9 expression thus endometriotic stromal cell proliferation through direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway is carried out via EP3 signaling while indirect one is mediated via induction of estrogen biosynthesis. PGE2 may cause overexpression of StAR and aromatase result in aberrant production of estrogen. It serves as primary source for induction of FGF-9 and its high affinity receptors via an autocrine mechanism when systemic estrogen is low. Estrogen-induced expression of FGF-9 may increase the chance for ectopic endometriotic lesions to survive and growth involving long-term maintenance of endometriosis. In a sense, my findings provide a new thinking direction of reevaluating effects of PGE2, estrogen, and peptide growth factors on the etiology of endometriosis and a molecular framework for future considerations in designing new regimens for therapeutic or preventive purpose against diseases with overexpression of cyclooxygenase.

中文摘要
本文研究的重點，著重於在車輛排氣管尾端所引發出來的流場與噪音分析，汽機車排氣管所排放的廢氣是一種具有脈衝式爆炸波的流體，它是非穩態及非線性的，不易以傳統的線性聲學理論來預測的。此脈衝式的流體流過排氣管出口之後會有一系列複雜的震波繞射現象發生，例如：繞射震波、渦漩的和膨脹波反射等現象。我們藉由高階的軸對稱尤拉與那維亞史託克解子，求解這些由震波與渦漩交互作用所引發出來的複雜的現象。為了節省計算的時間，我們在高階解子內加入了平行運算的技術。在數值方法上，使用由Jiang and Shu兩人所提出的五階準確度的加權基本不震盪法做為空間差分的方法，在時間的積分上則是採用四階準確度的 Runge-Kutta 方法。為了有效降低在排氣管口處由震波與渦漩交互作用所產生的噪音，我們設計了一個尾部平滑彎曲且漸擴的排氣管來代替傳統的直管排氣管。在文章中，詳細地研究排氣管下游的流場與聲場，並分析其噪音等級。當排氣管流場達到假穩態時，發現聲波會朝著某些主要的方向傳遞。在直管的例子中，最主要的聲波是朝著六十度角方向傳遞；在曲管的例子中，最主要的聲波是朝著零度角方向傳遞。	為了去估算脈衝式流體對排氣管流場和噪音的影響，我們在排氣管的入口處設置一週期性的入口邊界條件，這週期性的派衝波是經由實驗量測所獲得的，所量測的是三陽如意125機車，在測量時車子引擎的轉速是固定在每分鐘五千轉，車身是靜止不動。數值模擬的結果顯示，這週期性的入口脈衝波對於排氣管下游的流場及聲場有很大的影響，這些影響包括渦漩環的大小、渦漩中心的渦量值以及噪音量的等級。此外，為了考慮人耳對於聲音的響應頻率，A加權的噪音等級方法是被應用在分析噪音等級上。最後，對實驗量測的聲壓等級數據和數值模擬的聲壓等級值做比較。結果顯示，在直管例子中最大A加權的噪音等級誤差是0.8dBA；在曲管例子中最大A加權的噪音等級誤差是1.4dBA。再對最小噪音標準值做比較，結果顯示，在直管例子中最小A加權的噪音等級誤差是1.7dBA；在曲管例子中最小A加權的噪音等級誤差是0.9dBA。結果證實尾部彎曲且漸擴外形的排氣管確實達到縮小排氣管下游噪音範圍。


英文摘要
The present study focuses on the noise problem associated with a vehicle’s exhaust pipe. A pulsated flow with weak pulsating blast waves from a vehicle engine is discharged out of the vehicle’s exhaust pipe. The discharged pulsated flow and the induced shock/vortex interactions that result in radiated noise are numerically investigated by the axi-symmetric Euler/Navier-Stokes solver with the parallel computational technology. The numerical method used is a fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillation scheme of Jiang and Shu for spatial discretization and a fourth-order non-TVD Runge-Kutta method for time integration.In order to effectively reduce the radiated noise due to shock/vortex interactions near the pipe exit, the pipe shape near the exit is redesigned by using a smoothed curved, expanding shape near the pipe exit, instead of the traditional straight shape. The detailed flow field downstream of the pipe and its sound pressure level are studied. When the flow field has become a quasi-steady state, the major propagation direction of sound wave for the straight-pipe case is found in the 60° direction, which is different from the 0° direction for the curved-pipe case. Moreover, noise produced by the straight- and curved-shape pipe with periodic pulsating blast waves are analyzed and compared. The periodic pulsating wave is obtained by fitting the measured pressure data from a motorcycle exhaust pipe at an engine speed of 5000rpm at an idle condition. It is found that the periodic pulsating waves can greatly influence the downstream flow and sound fields such as the vortex–ring size, vortex-center vorticity and sound pressure level (SPL). In consideration of the frequency response of the human ear, the A-scale SPL method is applied to analyze sound pressure level. Experimental and simulated sound pressure levels are computed and compared. The results of sound pressure levels for experiment and simulation show that their absolute error in the maximum A-weighting SPL is 0.8dBA for the curved-pipe case and 1.4dBA for the straight-pipe case. Moreover, their absolute error in the minimum A-weighting SPL is 1.7dBA for the curved-pipe case and 0.9dBA for the straight-pipe case. It is proved that the partially curved, expanding pipe can reduce the noise region downstream of the pipe.

中文摘要
本研究之目的在於利用理論分析工業爐單燒和混燒高爐氣的熱能轉換特性，以作為實務上單燒高爐氣之參考依據，進而評估其操作條件與時機。首先探討燃料使用量、化學計量空氣需求量、絕熱火焰溫度、煙道氣排放量等四項重要參數對製程氣燃燒特性的影響，接著分析單燒和混燒高爐氣之加熱能力比。結果得到：在化學計量比且無預熱條件下，單燒高爐氣時需要大量的燃氣才可達到預定產熱；以高熱值燃氣混燒高爐氣，則燃氣量會因而減少，但燃燒空氣卻會因此增加，而絕熱火焰溫度與加熱能力比均會隨之上升。在固定製程氣混燒比例之條件下，當爐壁溫度越高，則混燒系統對爐壁之加熱能力比越低。當單燒高爐氣時，煙道氣富含進氣時高爐氣本身的不可燃氣，故其體積流率高；若混燒高爐氣，煙道氣體積流率會隨高爐氣的減少而降低。此外，最後更進一步探討增加10%的過剩空氣和0.1MW的預熱條件下，對製程氣混燒後之燃燒特性與加熱能力比的影響。    其次，本研究亦利用空氣-乙烯對沖流擴散火焰進行燃燒合成碳米碳管的實驗分析，探討溫度場、沉積位置與硝酸鎳濃度等三項參數，對於火焰合成奈米碳管的影響。結果發現火焰面溫度過高，易使金屬觸媒與火焰區內的不飽和自由基反應變成碳-金屬合金；反之，遠離火焰面溫度過低，會使觸媒失去活性而得到碳煙。在相同的徑向位置中，沿著火焰面往燃料端軸向移動，熱解離產生的不飽和自由基濃度變化為由少變多再變少，故奈米碳管生成變化為由無變有再變無。在鎳網格塗佈硝酸鎳條件下，可以增加碳管管長與生成量。


英文摘要
BFG is blast furnace gas, which is a fuel gas produced in quantities in the steelmaking process. For effective use of this BFG, it is significant to develop the technology of firing BFG individually without the support fuel, such as natural gas (NG) and heavy oil. However, as compared with the fuel of BFG in combination with coke oven gas (COG) or NG, BFG is low in calorie because of high rate of inert gas such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Owing to this special fuel condition, many technical problems, such as slow burning velocity and flame stability, remain to be solved in using BFG individually as the fuel for hot gas stoves and boilers. The combustion characteristics of firing BFG, individually or in combination with COG or NG, including fuel gas volume flow rate, air volume flow rate, adiabatic flame temperature, flue gas composition, and thermal efficiency were analyzed.     Results show that under the operating conditions of stoichiometry and without preheat at the same heat release rate, the fuel gas volume flow rate of firing BFG individually is greater than that of firing BFG with support fuel. The smaller air volume flow rate, the lower adiabatic flame temperature and the lower thermal efficiency of the former are found for the former as compared with the latter. However, the volume flow rate of flue gas for the former is greater than the latter because it contains a large amount of inert gases in the flue gas. Additionally, the combustion characteristics of firing BFG, individually or in combination with COG or NG were also discussed under the operating conditions of adding ten percent excess air and/or 0.1MW preheat.    Moreover, the synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a catalytic nickel substrate in counter-flow diffusion flames was investigated experimentally. The effects of sampling positions, gas temperature distributions and the concentration of nickel nitrate on the synthesis of CNTs were examined. Curved and entangled tubular multi-walled CNTs are harvested, which have both typical straight tubular and bamboo-like structures. Besides curved CNTs, helically coiled tubular CNTs are also synthesized.     Because of the flame surface with high temperature, the metal catalyst can easily react with the unsaturated free radical in the flame zone to form the carbon-metal alloy; whereas, the metal catalyst can lose its activity and obtain the soot in the position away from the flame surface in which the gas temperature is low. In the same radial position, the variation of the yield of CNTs is from no CNTs to agglomeration and then no CNTs. This is because the sample position moves along a vertical line from the flame surface to the upper burner corresponding to the concentration of unsaturated free radical from rare to dense and then rare. Using a Ni(NO3)2-coated substrate has advantages over uncoated Ni substrates, which can increase the length and the quantity of CNTs.

中文摘要
噴砂工法在國內已發展一段相當長時間，目前應用在工程界、工藝界、美容界甚至IC製造業均已相當成熟。國內近幾年來對古蹟之保存與修復相當熱絡，而古蹟立面與構件之修復常佔整體經費與工期之絕大部分，在國定古蹟「原台南州聽」與「台北賓館」均嘗試以噴砂工法進行外牆之去漆復舊，但對木料之去漆仍以剝漆劑、刨除法、火烤法等傳統工法，所以激起筆者對木料去漆工法是否可運用噴砂工法並改善其功率產生研究的興趣。     本文之研究方法乃先藉由「文獻資料整理」後，據以進行「專家訪談」，再依訪談專家所提供之意見進行「實驗」。本研究對象以省產檜木製木構件油漆表面為主要對象，範圍則選擇溼式噴砂工法為限。      本實驗針對噴砂工法設定變數為「噴擊次數」、「噴擊壓力」、「噴擊角度」三個變數，而鎖定「噴射距離」及「噴槍位移速度」進行實驗比對，期求出適合現場對木料去漆操作之理想建議值，期改善耗時之傳統工法，並供業界之使用參考。     本實驗變數之「噴擊次數」設定在一至四次；「噴擊壓力」設定5kgf/cm2、6 kgf/cm2、7 kgf/cm2；「噴擊角度」設定30O、45 O、60 O、90 O；噴擊距離則固定在60公分；噴槍位移速度固定在60cm/sec；依上述之規劃共完成240件試體。實驗具體成果綜理如下： 一、噴擊壓力：6kgf/cm2時最佳，5kgf/cm2時效果不佳，7kgf/cm2時易造成較嚴重之侵蝕現象。 二、噴擊角度：60 O時效果最佳，45 O時居次，90 O時效果適中，30O時效果不佳。 三、噴擊次數：噴擊二至三次效果最佳，噴擊一次效果不佳無法達到預期成果，噴擊四次造成侵蝕嚴重。 四、噴擊距離與噴槍位移速度，可因實際需要之效果再作調整。     本研究之噴砂工法去漆時所噴除之厚度，較其他傳統去漆工法（剝漆劑、火烤法、刨除法）所刮除厚度為小，所以在木料去漆使用本工法是可行的，且傷害木料的程度是較傳統工法輕微。此外對於可拆解或不可拆解之構件均可以施工，大幅改善了傳統工法高處作業之困難度。所以就「施工性」而言本工法較其他傳統工法為佳。     本工法亦可藉由調整上述各變數大小經試作而達到逐層去漆之效果，以符古蹟修復中「修舊如舊」之精神，且對環境之污染減至最小的程度。


英文摘要
Developed for a long time domestically, sand blast has been maturely applied in construction, art, cosmetology and IC manufacture. During the past few years, ancient monuments in Taiwan have been reserved and restored intensely;however, the restoration of surface and component always costs a great deal and takes a lot of time. In projects of the former Tainan City Government and Taipei Guest House, sand blast has been tried to remove the paint of the wall, but the paint of the timber part was still removed by traditional methods such as“paint stripping medicinal preparation”,“shaved off”,“heating.”Thus, I wonder if we can apply sand blast on timber paint removal to improve the power and efficiency.    First of all, I collected and coordinated related documents. Secondly, I interviewed specialists. Then I experimented according to specialists’ opinions. The object of study was surface of local juniper components. The method was focused on wet sand blast.    The variables were blast frequency, blast pressure and blast degree, while blast distance and blast displacement speed were set as constants for checking. I expected to get the ideal data suitable for timber paint removal and improve traditional time-consuming methods.    The blast frequency was set from 1 to 4 times; the blast pressure was set as 5kgf/cm2, 6 kgf/cm2 and 7 kgf/cm2 respectively; the blast degree 30O, 45 O, 60 O, 90 O respectively. The distance was fixed in 60cm; while displacement speed in 60cm/sec. According to above planning, I completed 240 tests. The outcome is described as below:1.	Blast pressure：6kgf/cm2 was the best one. The result of 5kgf/cm2 was not good and 7kgf/cm2 brought about serious erosion.2.	Blast degree：60 O was the best one. The results in order were 60 O >45 O >90 O >30O..3.	Blast frequency： 2 and 3 times made the perfect; while 1 time was not good enough and 4 times caused serious erosion.4.	Blast distance and displacement speed: flexible according to actual need.    The removed thickness by sand blast in this study was thinner than which by other traditional methods. This fact implies that sand blast causes slighter damage on timber than traditional methods do. Thus, sand blast is feasible on timber paint removal. Besides, it can be applied on both separable and inseparable components, reducing the difficulties of original high-place operation.     Sand blast method can also remove paint step by step with adjusting above variables to keep to the original and minimize the pollution.

中文摘要
先前的研究文獻指出，纖維母細胞生長因子-9 是神經細胞、前列腺細胞以及肺間質細胞的致裂原生長因子，可受類固醇賀爾蒙的調控，進而增加促性腺激素刺激生殖腺類固醇生成細胞的類固醇分泌。在生物胚胎發育時期，缺乏纖維母細胞生長因子-9 表現的小鼠，其性別轉換有從雄性轉變成為雌性，睪丸曲細精管發育不全的情況發生。顯示出纖維母細胞生長因子-9 在類固醇生成上扮演很重要的角色。我們先前的研究結果指出，在未成熟的雄性小鼠萊氏細胞，纖維母細胞生長因子-9是藉由結合到特定的纖維母細胞生長因子接受器3lllc，進一步的透過活化Ras-MAPK，PI3K以及PKA訊息傳遞機制而增加固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白表現以及睪固酮的生合成產量。然而，纖維母細胞生長因子-9刺激睪固酮的生成是透過如何調控固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白基因表現的分子調控機制，至今仍然未有定論。因此，本篇論文的目的在於探討纖維母細胞生長因子-9是否是透過活化依賴性環狀單磷酸環腺苷相關的轉錄因子去調控固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白啟動子上的特殊片段，而影響固醇類的生合成。近期內分泌分子機制的研究，常使用MA-10小鼠萊氏腫瘤細胞株作為動物細胞模式，由於此細胞株的17α羥化酶酵素量很低，所以偵測黃體酮為固醇類最終產物。結果顯示，隨著濃度的增加，纖維母細胞生長因子-9具有刺激黃體酮的生成。另外，我們在MA-10小鼠的萊氏腫瘤細胞上也偵測到FGFR2lllb, FGFR2lllc, FGFR3lllb, 以及FGFR3lllc這四種纖維母細胞生長因子接受器傳訊著核醣核酸的表現。西方點墨法結果顯示，纖維母細胞生長因子-9能有效刺激固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白的蛋白表現。進一步，我們使用已建構完成的載體，此載體帶有冷光酶的報導基因及全長1.3 kb的固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白啟動子的基因序列，將其轉植入MA-10小鼠的萊氏腫瘤細胞大量表現。根據測量轉殖後啟動子的活性結果，顯示纖維母細胞生長因子-9無法調控固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白啟動子的轉錄活性。然而，文獻顯示，在MA-10小鼠的萊氏腫瘤細胞中，經由環狀單磷酸環腺苷刺激固醇類的生合成機制是透過ERK 1/2 MEPK kinase磷酸化，繼而促使固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白基因的轉錄。相同的，我們證實在MA-10小鼠的萊氏腫瘤細胞中，纖維母細胞生長因子-9能有效刺激ERK 1/2 MAPK kinase的磷酸化，此磷酸化的現象可被我們加入的MAPK抑制劑U0126而抑制。 然而，MAPK抑制劑對纖維母細胞生長因子-9調控固醇類生合成急性調控蛋白的表現仍待未來進一步研究。總結，這些結果指出在MA-10小鼠的萊氏腫瘤細胞，纖維母細胞生長因子-9可能是透過調控MEPK-ERK訊息傳遞路徑，進而影響固醇類的生合成。


英文摘要
Previous studies demonstrated that FGF-9 was a steroid-regulated mitogen and survival factor for nerve cells, prostatic cells and lung mesenchymal cells. Besides, FGF-9 could modulate gonadotropin- stimulated steroid secretion in gonadal steroidogenic cells. During embryogenesis, FGF-9-knockout mice exhibited male-to-female sex reversal and seminiferous tubles hypoplasia in testis. These results indicated the critical role of FGF-9 on steroidogenesis. Our previous results demonstrated that FGF-9 increased the StAR expression and testosterone production by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor 3IIIc (FGFR3IIIc) and activating through Ras-MAPK, PI3K and PKA signaling pathways in immature mouse Leydig cells. However, the molecular mechanism on transcriptional level of StAR gene expression in FGF-9-stimulated testosterone production remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the steroidogenic effects by FGF-9 whether go through activating cAMP-dependent transcription factors to regulate the specific element of StAR promoter. In the present study, MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line was used to investigate the molecular mechanism. Results show that progesterone production was increased by FGF-9. In addition, four type FGF-9 receptors, 2IIIb, 2IIIc, 3IIIb and 3IIIc, were expressed in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. Using immunoblotting assays, FGF-9 could also increase StAR protein expression. Furthermore, MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were transiently transfected with plasmid containing luciferase gene with 5’-flanking 1.3kb StAR (-1278 ~ +32) promoter segments, which illustrated that FGF-9 did not regulate StAR promoter activity. However, FGF-9 might activate phosphorylation of ERK1, 2, MAP kinases pathway. Taken together, these data indicated that FGF9 might go through MEK-ERK signaling pathway to increase progesterone production rather than activate StAR promoter activity in MA-10 cells.

中文摘要
鹼激發膠凝材料是指各種矽酸鹽類和鋁矽酸鹽類礦物，在添加固體或液狀鹼激發劑的作用下所形成具有膠結性質的材料。由於原料和製作過程的不同，使得膠凝材料之硬化機制和水化產物與波特蘭水泥大不相同。近年來這類膠凝材料被認為具有特殊優良的性能，如抗壓強度、抗腐蝕性、抗滲透性和耐久性等都優於普通波特蘭水泥。     本文使用爐石和飛灰這些工業廢料作為鹼膠凝材料，為了試驗結果的討論我們將依照不同成分配比和固定水固比兩者方式進行，從材料外部的工作性質、抗壓強度試驗，到內部微觀構造作一完整分析。利用電子顯微鏡觀察發現這類膠凝材料的產物，包括土壤聚合物膠體以及各類水化物膠體。不過由於良好外觀與緻密微觀結構，這也是材料展現優越性能的原因。


英文摘要
The Alkali-activated cementitious materials refer to each kind of silicates and aluminosilicates which adds the solid or liquid state of alkali activator to initiate a reaction and produce a material with cementitious property. Due to the differences between the raw material and the manufacture process, the hardened mechanism and hydrates differ from those of Portland cement entirely. In recent years, this kind of material is considered to be fabulous performance, for instance, high compressive strength, corrosion resistance, permeation resistance, durability, etc., are much better than Portland cement.     In this study, the industrial waste such as granulated blast furnace slag, and fly ash were investigated as basic ingredient of alkali-activated cementitious materials, according to different mixture of materials we fix the water and solid ratio to discuss the experiment results, and make the analysis from material mechanics properties, compressive strength test, to internal microstructure completely. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the end products of alkali-activated cementitious materials, geopolymer gel and calcium silicate hydrate gel are included. However, because of its well apparel and firm structure, it is the reason mechanical excel in its performance.

中文摘要
了解細胞黏附力於生醫材料上的表現可最為評估生醫材料親合性的方法。細胞的黏附會影響細胞增生與分化。然而，量測細胞黏附力的設備大多需要精密的儀器，設備較複雜。所以我們設計一種簡單的動態施力設備，可快速測得細胞與基材的黏附力。利用已知力量的刮細胞量測技術來做細胞黏附力的比較。選用鈣磷生醫陶瓷與純鈦當作測試基材。因此本篇研究目的是設計量測細胞黏附力的方法，並以鈣磷生醫陶瓷與純鈦來觀察類骨母細胞的反應。實驗分成四部份：第一部份-確定射頻功率對鈣磷薄膜沉積性質的影響。以alpha-step、SEM、EDS和XRD分析結構與化學組成，實驗結果顯示披覆在試片上的鈣磷薄膜為非結晶相，經500℃熱處理後轉換為結晶相的鈣磷薄膜。第二部份製備兩種表面粗糙度，分別為以砂紙號數#180研磨與研磨到#1500號後使用Al2O3拋光。產生的表面粗糙度為(Ra = 0.48,0.04 micrometer)。第三部份-量測細胞在生醫陶瓷表面的黏附力，以我們設計的動態施力方式量測細胞黏附力並與刮細胞方式量測細胞黏附力作比較。實驗結果顯示細胞於Polish組黏附強度較高的為Polish CaP-h，次之為Polish和Polish CaP，與刮細胞的量測方式結果相同；#180組力量較高的為#180，次之為#180 CaP-h和#180 CaP與刮細胞方式相異，在統計上沒有顯著差異。由免疫螢光染色觀測細胞骨架經離心後無明顯變化。第四部份使用SEM評估細胞在不同條件試片上黏附型態，在Polish組和#180組可觀察到細胞於CaP-h表面黏附面積最大，其次是沒有鈣磷塗層的鈦，接著是CaP塗層試片。在Polish組細胞黏附面積與使用動態施力設備和刮細胞方式量測結果呈現正相關，然而較粗糙的#180組別在兩種方式的量測下無一致趨勢。因此推測動態施力設備可運用於較細緻的表面，不適合量測粗糙質較高的表面。此實驗結果得知CaP-h相對於CaP有較佳的生物活性而讓細胞展現較高的黏附力量。


英文摘要
Cell adhesion strength on biomaterials can assess biomaterials biocompatibility. Cellular attachment influences cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, quantitative methods for examining cell adhesion mostly need accurate instrument, which  is relatively complicated. We develop a simple and easy technique to quantitatively measure the adhesion force between cells and substrate. To utilize cytodetachment technique to make comparison that cells adhesion strength. We select the calcium phosphorus bioceramics and commercially titanium as substrate to make comparison. The aim of this study was to develop a dynamic technique to quantitatively measure the adhesive force between cells and substrata. The study is divided into four parts. PartΙ. To determine the influence of discharge RF power level on the properties of the deposited Ca/P films on titanium substrates. The structure and chemical composition were investigated with alpha-step (thickness), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that as-sputtered CaP coatings were amorphous, and 500°C heat-treated CaP coatings were crystalline. Part Ⅱ. Titanium alloy disks are prepared by wet grinding by grit silicon carbide paper #180 and wet grinding to #1500 then polishing by Al2O3 powder to the surface roughness with Ra values of 0.48 and 0.04 micrometer, respectively. Part Ⅲ. The measurement of cell adhesion force on bioceramics will be compared with dynamic applied forced and cytodetachment technique. The results showed that cell adhesion force on polish CaP-h more strength than polish CaP and Polish CaP that the same the cytodetachment. However, the cell adhesion force on #180 more strength than #180 CaP-h and #180 CaP that different to cytodetachment. Part Ⅳ. To evaluate the cells morphology in different conditions. Cells displayed well spreading on CaP-h coating than non-coated titanium and CaP. The cell attachment area and cell adhesion force is being connected on Polish group. However rougher #180 group not consistent tendency. Therefore, the dynamic technique utilize to smooth surface not roughness surface.

中文摘要
血管新生表現型的出現(血管新生作用開關)，是子宮頸癌化過程是必須的步驟。而血管新生作用開關是由血管新生活化因子與抑制因子兩者相互抗衡的所調控。第一型血小板活化素(thrombospondin, TSP-1)是一種內生性血管新生抑制因子，具有多處大分子特殊結構(domains)及多個受體(receptor)。首先，我們探討在子宮頸鱗狀細胞癌化過程中，第一型血小板活化素的表現與人體子宮頸鱗狀細胞癌及其癌前病變之子宮頸檢體中，在時間與空間上的關聯性；以及其與腫瘤血管新生表現型的關聯性。我們的結果顯示：第一型血小板活化素主要表現於正常子宮頸基底上皮細胞層，如柵欄(我們命名為“第一型血小板活化素柵欄”)一般阻止血管新生的出現。當子宮頸上皮細胞由低階鱗狀上皮內病變(LSIL)進入至高階鱗狀上皮內病變(HSIL)時，此柵欄發生崩解，與血管新生表現型的出現是同時發生的。由這樣的結果我們推測，第一型血小板活化素扮演抑制血管新生作用的調控角色。血管新生作用開始於子宮頸癌化過程中的早期，與增殖異常的上皮組織中發生第一型血小板活化素的下調節有相關。基質作用(stroma reaction)是指腫瘤癌化過程中，基質由本來抑制轉為幫助上皮細胞成長，形成適合腫瘤成長環境的反應。因為，第一型血小板活化素除了已知抑制血管新生的角色外，同時也扮演著影響其他基質細胞(如纖維母細胞等)的生理作用的角色。所以，我們假設第一型血小板活化素可以經由抑制基質反應，進而達到抑制腫瘤成長。可能的作用機轉是經由抑制纖維母細胞的活性(移動性、侵襲性等生物特性)、以及抑制基質標記表現量。在本研究中我們探討：一：在臨床子宮頸癌及其癌前病變檢體中，檢視第一型血小板活化素的表現量與基質標記表現量之相關性；二：藉由免疫不全鼠(SCID mice)的異體腫瘤移植實驗，探討第一型血小板活化素經由抑制血管新生，以及基質反應而達到抗腫瘤成長的能力；三：探討第一型血小板活化素經由抑制肌纖維母細胞(活化型纖維母細胞)的移動力、侵襲力，達到抑制基質反應的能力。實驗結果顯示：一、在臨床病人檢體的免疫組織化學染色中發現，第一型血小板活化素表現量消失，會同時合併兩種基質標記α-SMA與 desmin過度表現。顯示在子宮頸癌化過程中，第一型血小板活化素與腫瘤基質反應有關連性。二、經由轉染第一型血小板活化素進入子宮頸癌細胞株(SiHa)，建立第一型血小板活化素過度表現的子宮頸癌細胞株(SiHa-TSP-1)。在體外模式中，具有抑制血管新生作用的生理功能。同時在免疫不全鼠的異體腫瘤移植實驗中，第一型血小板活化素過度表現可以經由降低腫瘤血管生長以及減少基質標記α-SMA與desmin的表現，達到抑制腫瘤生長的作用。三、經由轉染建立第一型血小板活化素過度表現的纖維母細胞株(NIH3T3-TSP-1)或是外加純化的第一型血小板活化素至纖維母細胞株(NIH3T3)中，發現第一型血小板活化素並不會直接影響纖維母細胞株(NIH3T3)之α-SMA與desmin蛋白質的表現量。在乙型變型性成長因子(transforming growth factor β, TGF-β)處理的情況下(乙型變型性成長因子，會增加纖維母細胞的活化作用及其細胞分化及α-SMA與 desmin過度表現)，第一型血小板活化素也沒有抑制作用。相對地，第一型血小板活化素會明顯抑制乙型變型性成長因子處理纖維母細胞株(NIH3T3)後所增加纖維細胞移動力，並抑制金屬蛋白酶-2 (MMP-2)的活性及侵襲癌細胞群的能力。至於作用的細胞種類，不論是經由轉染至子宮頸癌細胞株中(SiHa-TSP-1)或是直接外加純化的第一型血小板活化素至子宮頸癌細胞株中時，對NIH3T3細胞株的侵襲癌細胞群的能力沒有影響。相對地，經由轉染至纖維母細胞株(NIH3T3-TSP-1)或是外加純化的第一型血小板活化素至纖維母細胞株(NIH3T3)中，對NIH3T3細胞株的侵襲癌細胞群的能力皆有影響。綜合這些結果，我們發現第一型血小板活化素具有抑制基質反應功能的新角色。第一型血小板活化素會抑制免疫不全鼠異體移植腫瘤形成模式中基質標記的表現，與臨床病人子宮頸病變檢體基質標記的表現相符合。第一型血小板活化素經由抑制肌纖維母細胞(非宮頸癌細胞)移動力及侵襲能力，達到抑制基質反應並可能回復腫瘤基質反應到正常狀態。在未來，藉由控制腫瘤基質微環境，可能可以提高治療癌症的有效能力。


英文摘要
The acquisition of an angiogenic phenotype (angiogenic switch) is essential for cervical carcinogenesis. The angiogenic switch is balanced by the angiogenic activators and inhibitors. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an endogenous angiogenic inhibitor with multiple functional domains and interacting receptors. Our study was firstly aimed to examine the spatial and temporal relationship of TSP-1 expression in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix and its precursor lesions, and to correlate its expression with tumor angiogenesis. Our results indicate the disruption of TSP-1 fence (the expression of TSP-1 in basal epithelia) and the switch to angiogenic phenotype occurred concordantly during the transition from low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) into high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). This concordance suggests that TSP-1 play a role in the regulation of angiogenic switch during cervical carcinogenesis. We conclude that the onset of angiogenesis is an early event in cervical carcinogenesis due, in part, to the down-regulation of TSP-1 by the dysplastic epithelium.Stroma reaction (also called stromagenesis) is a host reaction of stroma cells that, when induced in cancer, produces a progressive and permissive mesenchymal microenvironment, thereby supporting tumor progress. In addition to the well-known angiogenesis inhibitor, TSP-1 has been shown to exert different biological functions on various stromal cell types, e.g. fibroblasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that TSP-1 may play a role in stroma reaction, characterized by fibroblast activation. We firstly tried to elucidate the correlation between the TSP-1 expression and the overexpression of stroma markers in human cervical lesions; secondly, we tried to elucidate whether TSP-1 can exhibit its anti-tumor effects through the angio-inhibitory effects and the ability to inhibit tumor stroma reaction in SCID mice xenotransplant model; thirdly, we tried to elucidate whether TSP-1 can change the stroma reaction by inhibiting the migration and invasive ability of myofibroblast (activated fibroblasts) from invading tumor cell cluster. Our results revealed: First, immunohistochemistry staining of human clinical specimens showed the disappearance of TSP-1 coincided with the emergence of the overexpression of two stromal markers, α-SMA and desmin, in a stepwise pattern. Second, transfection of SiHa cervical cancer cells with a plasmid expressing the TSP-1 protein exhibited anti-angiogenic activity in vitro, and resulted in reduced tumor growth in SCID mice, which was accompanied by a decrease in tumor vascularization and lower expressions of α-SMA and desmin than those in the vector controls. Third, transfection with TSP-1 and purified TSP-1 added to NIH3T3 cells did not alter the protein levels of α-SMA and desmin which was increased by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), a potent fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation factor, but significantly inhibited matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) activity. The increased migration ability and the invasive ability into tumor cluster of TGF-β-treated-NIH3T3 cells were dose-dependently inhibited by TSP-1. In contrast, ectopic TSP-1 expression in SiHa cells has little effect on the invasive ability of the NIH3T3 cells. Together, these data demonstrate that TSP-1 possesses a novel role to reduce the expression of stromal markers in both human clinical specimens, and an in vivo tumor model. The inhibitory ability of TSP-1 to reverse stroma reaction could be partly attributed to the blockage of myofibroblasts from invading cancer. By targeting the tumor-stroma microenvironment, treatment effectiveness could be increased.

中文摘要
接地之目的是在確保人員與電氣設備之安全，一個理想的接地系統其接地電阻須接近於零歐姆，但實際上接地電阻是不會等於零歐姆。當故障電流流經接地系統時，會產生接地電位升，接地系統必須確保由於故障電流所產生之接地電位升不會造成人員感電及設備破壞，因此一般均要求接地電阻越低越好；然而在一些高電阻係數的區域，譬如砂礫、沙質土壤及岩石等區域，以直接埋設接地棒的方式是不可能獲得一個低的接地電阻值，所以加入接地電阻低減劑是一可用的作法之一。    本論文提出使用水淬爐石及轉爐石當作接地電阻低減劑之主要材料，加入不同比例的水、水泥及食鹽，考慮電阻係數與凝固強度等因素，找出一個有效組合作為接地電阻低減劑之用，並經由實驗驗證本論文提出之接地電阻低減劑可以有效地降低接地電阻。接著本論文也討論接地電阻低減劑之使用量並推導在減少相同接地電阻情況下之接地電阻低減劑最佳使用量，接地電阻低減劑使用量越多，接地電阻會越低，然而當接地電阻低減劑使用量增加至一定數量時，降低接地電阻的作用會出現飽和現象，所以接地電阻低減劑之使用量必須避開飽和區域以達到接地電阻低減劑之最高使用效率。最後本論文也提出計算埋入式接地棒連接絕緣引線之最大步級電壓及其位置之方法，由模擬結果可知；接地棒之接地電阻、地面電壓及步級電壓會隨著接地棒之埋入深度增加而降低。而推入式接地棒其接地電阻、地面電壓及步級電壓均高於埋入式接地棒連接絕緣引線之方法，所以本論文建議接地工程施工時採用埋入式接地棒連接絕緣引線之方法。本論文之研究結果不僅提出新型接地電阻低減劑且也探討接地安全之問題。


英文摘要
The goal of grounding is to ensure the safety of humans and electrical equipment. An ideal grounding system should provide near-zero ground resistance. In practice, however, ground resistance is not near zero. Ground potential should rise when the fault current flows into the ground system. The grounding system thus should ensure that ground potential rise that occurs due to fault current will not cause electric shock or equipment damage. Therefore, the lower ground resistance demands, the better. Nevertheless, in some areas with high soil resistivity, such as in gravel, sandy soil or rocky regions, it may not be possible to obtain low ground resistance. So, the addition of a ground resistance reduction agent may be one of most suitable measures.    First, this dissertation proposes using granulated blast furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag as the main materials in a ground resistance reduction agent. Adding different proportions of water, cement and salt, resistivity and clot strength of ground resistance reduction agent are considered in the quest to find an effective combination. The effectiveness of the identified combination in reducing ground resistance is experimentally verified. Then, this research discusses quantity of ground resistance reduction agent used for ground rod, and derives optimum quantity of ground resistance reduction agent needed to reduce ground resistance by the same amount. Ground resistance decreases with increasing quantity of ground resistance reduction agent used. However, ground resistance reduction effect will display the saturation phenomenon when the quantity of ground resistance reduction agent used increases to a certain level. Additional quantities of ground resistance reduction agent should be avoided in saturated areas in order to maximize its efficient use. Finally, this dissertation proposes a method for calculating the position and magnitude of maximum step voltage for buried ground rod with insulation lead. Simulation results show that ground resistance, earth surface voltage, and step voltage decrease as depth of buried ground rod increases. Ground resistance, earth surface voltage, and step voltage in driven ground method exceed those of buried ground rod with the insulation lead. Therefore, this dissertation suggests that grounding should be achieved by the use of buried ground rods with insulation lead. Results of this research not only provide a valuable method for decreasing ground resistance but also increase the safety of grounding.

History[edit]
Main articles: History of Toledo, Spain and Timeline of Toledo, Spain
Antiquity[edit]
Toledo (Latin: Toletum) is mentioned by the Roman historian Livy (ca. 59 BCE – 17 CE) as urbs parva, sed loco munita ("a small city, but fortified by location"). Roman general Marcus Fulvius Nobilior fought a battle near the city in 193 BCE against a confederation of Celtic tribes including the Vaccaei, Vettones, and Celtiberi, defeating them and capturing a king called Hilermus.[2][3] At that time, Toletum was a city of the Carpetani tribe, and part of the region of Carpetania.[4] It was incorporated into the Roman Empire as a civitas stipendiaria, that is, a tributary city of non-citizens. It later achieved the status of municipium by Flavian times.[5] With this status, city officials, even of Carpetani origin, obtained Roman citizenship for public service, and the forms of Roman law and politics were increasingly adopted.[6] At approximately this time were constructed in Toletum a Roman circus, city walls, public baths, and a municipal water supply and storage system.[7]
The Roman circus in Toledo was one of the largest in Hispania, at 423 metres (1,388 feet) long and 100 metres (330 feet) wide, with a track dimension of 408 metres (1,339 feet) long and 86 metres (282 feet) wide.[7] Chariot races were held on special holidays and were also commissioned by private citizens to celebrate career achievements. A fragmentary stone inscription records circus games paid for by a citizen of unknown name to celebrate his achieving the sevirate, a kind of priesthood conferring high status. Archaeologists have also identified portions of a special seat of the sort used by the city elites to attend circus games, called a sella curulis. The circus could hold up to 15000 spectators.[7]
During Roman times, Toledo was never a provincial capital nor a conventus iuridicus.[8] It started to gain importance in late antiquity. There are indications that large private houses (domus) within the city walls were enlarged, while several large villas were built north of the city through the third and fourth centuries.[9] Games were held in the circus into the late fourth and early fifth centuries C.E., also an indication of active city life and ongoing patronage by wealthy elites.[10] A church council was held in Toledo in the year 400 to discuss the conflict with Priscillianism.[11] A second council of Toledo was held in 527. The Visigothic king Theudis was in Toledo in 546, where he promulgated a law. This is strong though not certain evidence that Toledo was the chief residence for Theudis.[8] King Athanagild died in Toledo, probably in 568. Although Theudis and Athangild based themselves in Toledo, Toledo was not yet the capital city of the Iberian peninsula, as Theudis and Athangild's power was limited in extent, the Suevi ruling Galicia and local elites dominating Lusitania, Betica, and Cantabria.[12][13] This changed with Liuvigild (Leovigild), who brought the peninsula under his control. The Visigoths ruled from Toledo until the Moors conquered the Iberian peninsula in the early years of 8th century (711–719).
Today the historic center contains basements, passages, wells, baths and ancient water pipes that since Roman times have been used in the city.
Visigothic Toledo[edit]

A series of church councils was held in Toledo under the Visigoths. A synod of Arian bishops was held in 580 to discuss theological reconciliation with Nicene Christianity.[14] Liuvigild's successor, Reccared, hosted the third council of Toledo, at which the Visigothic kings abandoned Arianism and reconciled with the existing Hispano-Roman episcopate.[15] A synod held in 610 transferred the metropolitanate of the old province of Carthaginensis from Cartagena to Toledo.[16] At that time, Cartagena was ruled by the Byzantines, and this move ensured a closer relation between the bishops of Spain and the Visigothic kings. King Sisebut forced Jews in the Visigothic kingdom to convert to Christianity; this act was criticized and efforts were made to reverse it at the Fourth Council of Toledo in 633.[17] The Fifth and Sixth Councils of Toledo placed church sanctions on anyone who would challenge the Visigothic kings.[18] The Seventh Council of Toledo instituted a requirement that all bishops in the area of a royal city, that is, of Toledo, must reside for one month per year in Toledo. This was a stage in "the elevation of Toledo as the primatial see of the whole church of the Visgothic kingdom".[19] In addition, the seventh council declared that any clergy fleeing the kingdom, assisting conspirators against the king, or aiding conspirators, would be excommunicated and no one should remove this sentence. The ban on lifing these sentences of excommunication was lifted at the Eighth Council of Toledo in 653, at which, for the first time, decisions were signed by palace officials as well as bishops.[20]
The eighth council of Toledo took measures that enhanced Toledo's significance as the center of royal power in the Iberian peninsula. The council declared that the election of a new king following the death of the old one should only take place in the royal city, or wherever the old king died.[21] In practice this handed the power to choose kings to only such palace officials and military commanders who were in regular attendance on the king. The decision also took king-making power away from the bishops, who would be in their own sees and would not have time to come together to attend the royal election. The decision did allow the bishop of Toledo, alone among bishops, to be involved in decisions concerning the royal Visigothic succession. The ninth and tenth councils were held in rapid succession in 655 and 656.[21]
When Reccesuinth died in 672 at his villa in Gerticos, his successor Wamba was elected on the spot, then went to Toledo to be anointed king by the bishop of Toledo, according to the procedures laid out in prior church councils.[22] In 673, Wamba defeated a rebel duke named Paul, and held his victory parade in Toledo. The parade included ritual humiliation and scalping of the defeated Paul.[23] Wamba carried out renovation works in Toledo in 674-675, marking these with inscriptions above the city gates that are no longer extant but were recorded in the eighth century.[24] The Eleventh Council of Toledo was held in 675 under king Wamba. Wamba weakened the power of the bishop of Toledo by creating a new bishopric outside Toledo at the church of Saints Peter and Paul. This was one of the main churches of Toledo and was the church where Wamba was anointed king, and the church from which Visigothic kings departed for war after special ceremonies in which they were presented with a relic of the True Cross. By creating a new bishopric there, Wamba removed power over royal succession from the bishop of Toledo and granted it to the new bishop.[25] The Twelfth Council of Toledo was held in 681 after Wamba's removal from office. Convinced that he was dying, Wamba had accepted a state of penitence that according to the decision of a previous church council, made him inelegible to remain king. The Twelfth Council, led by newly installed bishop Julian confirmed the validity of Wamba's removal from office and his succession by Ervig. The Twelfth Council eliminated the new bishopric that Wamba had created and returned the powers over succession to the bishop of Toledo.[26]
The Twelfth Council of Toledo approved 28 laws against the Jews. Julian of Toledo, despite a Jewish origin, was strongly anti-Semitic as reflected in his writings and activities.[27] The leading Jews of Toledo were assembled in the church of Saint Mary on January 27, 681, where the new laws were read out to them.
The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Councils of Toledo were held in 683, 684, and 688. The Thirteenth Council restored property and legal rights to those who had rebelled against King Wamba in 673.[28] The Thirteenth Council also approved laws protecting the king's family after the king's death. In 687, Ervig took the penitent state before dying, and the kingship passed to Egica, who was anointed king in Toledo on November 24.[29] In 688, the Fifteenth Council lifted the ban on taking property from the families of former kings, whereupon Egica was able to plunder Ervig's family properties.[30]
In the late seventh century, Toledo became a main center of literacy and writing in the Iberian peninsula. Toledo's development as a center of learning was influenced by Isidore of Seville, an author and advocate of literacy who attended several church councils in Toledo.[31] King Chindasuinth had a royal library in Toledo, and at least one count called Laurentius had a private library.[32] Sometime before 651, Chindasuinth sent the bishop of Zaragoza, Taio, to Rome to obtain books that were not available in Toledo. Taio obtained, at least, parts of pope Gregory's Moralia.[33] The library also contained a copy of a Hexameron by Dracontius, which Chindasuinth liked so much that he commissioned Eugenius II to revise it by adding a new part dealing with the seventh day of creation.[34] Chindasuinth issued laws that were gathered together in a book called Liber Iudiciorum by his successor Reccesuinth in 654; this book was revised twice, widely copied, and was an important influence on medieval Spanish law.[35] Three bishops of Toledo wrote works that were widely copied and disseminated in western Europe and parts of which survive to this day: Eugenius II, Ildefonsus, and Julian.[36] "In intellectual terms the leading Spanish churchmen of the seventh century had no equals before the appearance of Bede."[37]
In 693, the Sixteenth Council of Toledo condemned Sisebert, Julian's successor as bishop of Toledo, for having rebelled against King Egica in alliance with Liuvigoto, the widow of king Ervig.[38] A rebel king called Suniefred seized power in Toledo briefly at about this time. Whether or not Sisebert's and Suniefred's rebellions were the same or separate is unknown. Suniefred is known only from having minted coins in Toledo during what should have been Egica's reign.[39] The Seventeenth Council of Toledo was held in 694. The Eighteenth Council of Toledo, the last one, took place shortly after Egica's death around 702 or 703.[40]
By the end of the seventh century the bishop of Toledo was the leader of the Spanish bishops, a situation unusual in Europe: "The metropolitan bishops of Toledo had achieved by the last quarter of the seventh century an authority and a primacy that was unique in Western Europe. Not even the pope could count on such support from neighbouring metropolitans."[37] Toledo "had been matched by no other city in western Europe outside Italy as the governmental and symbolic center of a powerful monarchy."[41] Toledo had "emerged from relative obscurity to become the permanent governmental centre of the Visigothic monarchy; a true capital, whose only equivalent in western Europe was to be Lombard Pavia."[42]
When Wittiza died around 710, Ruderic became Visigothic king in Toledo, but the kingdom was split, as a rival king Achila ruled Tarraconensis and Narbonensis.[43] Meanwhile, Arabic and Berber troops under Musa ibn Nusayr had conquered Tangiers and Ceuta between 705 and 710, and commenced raids into the Visigothic kingdom in 711.[44] Ruderic led an army to confront the raiders. He was defeated and killed in battle, apparently after being betrayed by Visigothic nobles who wished to replace him as king and did not consider the Arabs and Berbers a serious threat. The commander of the invading forces was Tariq bin Ziyad, a Luwata Berber freedman in the service of governor Musa.[45] It is possible that a king called Oppa ruled in Toledo between Ruderic's death and the fall of Toledo.[46] Tariq, seizing the opportunity presented by the death of Ruderic and the internal divisions of the Visigothic nobles, captured Toledo, in 711 or 712.[47] Governor Musa disembarked in Cádiz and proceeded to Toledo, where he executed numerous Visigothic nobles, thus destroying much of the Visigothic power structure.[48][49] Collins suggests that the Visigothic emphasis on Toledo as the center of royal ceremony became a weakness. Since the king was chosen in or around Toledo, by nobles based in Toledo, and had to be anointed king by the bishop of Toledo in a church in Toledo, when Tariq captured Toledo and executed the Visigothic nobles, having already killed the king, there was no way for the Visigoths to select a legitimate king.[50][51]
Toledo under Arab rule[edit]
Soon after the conquest, Musa and Tariq returned to Damascus. The Arab center of administration was placed first in Seville, then moved to Cordoba. With most of the rest of the Iberian peninsula, Toledo was ruled from Cordoba by the governor of Al-Andalus, under the ultimate notional command of the Umayyad Caliph in Damascus. Arab conquerors had often replaced former capital cities with new ones to mark the change in political power, and they did so here: "Toledo suffered a period of profound decline throughout much of the earlier centuries of Arab dominance in the peninsula."[52] The invaders were ethnically diverse, and available evidence suggests that in the area of Toledo, Berber settlement predominated over Arab.[53]
In 742 the Berbers in Al-Andalus rebelled against the Arab Omeyyad governors. They took control of the north and marched south, laying siege to Toledo. After a siege of one month the Berber troops were defeated outside Toledo by troops sent from Cordoba by the governor Abd al-Malik ibn Katan and commanded by the governor's son.[54] However, while Ibn Katan's troops were engaged with the Berbers, his Arab allies betrayed and killed him and took over Cordoba. After the Arabs' first leader, Talama ibn Salama, died, Yusuf al-Fihri became ruler of Al-Andalus. The Omeyyad dynasty in Damascus collapsed and Yusuf ruled independently with the support of his Syrian Arab forces. The Qays Arab commander As-Sumayl was made governor of Toledo under Yusuf around 753.[55]
There is evidence that Toledo retained its importance as a literary and ecclesiastical center into the middle 700s, in the Chronicle of 754, the life of Saint Ildefonsus by Cixila, and ecclesiastical letters sent from Toledo.[56] The eighth century bishop of Toledo, Cixila, wrote a life of Saint Ildefonsus of Toledo, probably before 737.[57] This life of Ildefonsus emphasized two episodes in the life of the bishop of Toledo. In the first episode the covering of the tomb of Saint Leocadia levitated while Ildefonsus was saying mass, with king Reccesuinth present. In the second episode Mary appears to Ildefonsus and Reccesuinth. These episodes are said to have resulted from Ildefonsus' devotion to Saint Leocadia, patroness saint of Toledo.[58] Collins suggests that Cixila's life of Ildefonsus helped maintain Ildefonsus' appeal and helped the church in Toledo to retain some of its authority among Christian churches in the Iberian peninsula.[59]
An archdeacon in Toledo called Evantius, who was active around 720 and died in 737, wrote a letter to address the existence of judaizing tendencies among the Christians of Zaragoza, specifically the belief that there are unclean forms of meat and the literal interpretation of Deuteronomic law.[60] A deacon and cantor from Toledo called Peter wrote a second letter, to Seville, in about the year 750, to explain that they were celebrating Easter and a September liturgical fast incorrectly, again confusing them with Jewish feasts celebrated at the same time.[61] These letters show that some of the primacy of the church of Toledo within the Iberian peninsula still existed in the 700s: "Not only were its clerics still well enough equipped in intellectual terms to provide authoritative guidance on a wide range of ecclesiastical discipline and doctrine, but this was also actively sought."[62]
There is a strong possibility that the Chronicle of 754 was written in Toledo (though scholars have also proposed Cordoba and Guadix) based on the information available to the chronicler.[63] The chronicler showed awareness of the Historia Gothorum, the Etymologiae, and the chronicle of Isidore of Seville, the work of Braulio of Zaragoza, the acts of the councils of Toledo, De Perpetua Virginitate by Ildefonsus, and De Comprobatione Sextae Aetatis and Historia Wambae by Julian of Toledo, all works that would have existed in the Visigothic libraries of seventh century Toledo and whose existence together "makes more sense in a Toledan context than in any other."[64]
In 756 Abd ar-Rahman, a descendant of the fallen Omeyyad caliphs, came to Al-Andalus and initiated a revolt against Yusuf. He defeated Yusuf and forced him to reside in Cordoba, but Yusuf broke the agreement and raised a Berber army to fight Abd ar-Rahman. In this conflict, Toledo was held against Abd ar-Rahman by Yusuf's cousin Hisham ibn Urwa. Yusuf attempted to march on Seville, but was defeated and instead attempted to reach his cousin in Toledo. He was either killed on his way to Toledo, or he reached Toledo and held out there for as many as two or three years before being betrayed and killed by his own people. Whether or not Yusuf himself held out in Toledo, Hisham ibn Urwa did hold power in Toledo for several years, resisting the authority of Abd ar-Rahman. In 761 Hisham is reported as again being in rebellion in Toledo against Abd ar-Rahman. Abd ar-Rahman failed to take Toledo by force and instead signed a treaty allowing Hisham to remain in control of Toledo, but giving one of his sons as hostage to Abd ar-Rahman. Hisham continued to defy Abd ar-Rahman, who had Hisham's son executed and the head catapulted over the city walls into Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman attacked Toledo in 764, winning only when some of Hisham's own people betrayed him and turned him over to Abd ar-Rahman and his freedman Badr.[65] Ibn al-Athir states that towards the end of Abd ar-Rahman's reign, a governor of Toledo raided in force into the Kingdom of Asturias during the reign of Mauregatus,[66] though the Asturian chronicles do not record the event.[67]
Under the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba, Toledo was the centre of numerous insurrections dating from 761 to 857.[68] Twenty years after the rebellion of Hisham ibn Urwa, the last of Yusuf's sons, Abu al-Aswad ibn Yusuf, rebelled in Toledo in 785.[69][70] After the suppression of ibn Yusuf's revolt, Abd ar-Rahman's oldest son Sulayman was made governor of Toledo. However, Abd ar-Rahman designated as his successor a younger son, Hisham. On Hisham's accession to the Emirate in 788, Sulayman refused to make the oath of allegiance at the mosque, as succession custom would have dictated, and thus declared himself in rebellion. He was joined in Toledo by his brother Abdallah. Hisham laid siege to Toledo. While Abdallah held Toledo against Hisham, Sulayman escaped and attempted to find support elsewhere, but was unsuccessful. In 789, Abdallah submitted and Hisham took control of Toledo. The following year, Sulayman gave up the fight and went into exile.[71] Hisham's son Al-Hakam was governor of Toledo from 792 to 796 when he succeeded his father as emir in Cordoba.
After Al-Hakam's accession and departure, a poet resident in Toledo named Girbib ibn-Abdallah wrote verses against the Omeyyads, helping to inspire a revolt in Toledo against the new emir in 797. Chroniclers disagree as to the leader of this revolt, though Ibn Hayyan states that it was led by Ibn Hamir. Al-Hakam sent Amrus ibn Yusuf to fight the rebellion. Amrus took control of the Berber troops in Talavera. From there, Amrus negotiated with a faction inside Toledo called the Banu Mahsa, promising to make them governors if they would betray Ibn Hamir. The Banu Mahsa brought Ibn Hamir's head to Amrus at Talavera, but instead of making them governors, Amrus executed them. Amrus now persuaded the remaining factions in Toledo to submit to him. Once he entered Toledo, he invited the leaders to a celebratory feast. As they entered Amrus' fortress, the guests were beheaded one by one and their bodies thrown in a specially dug ditch. The massacre was thus called "The Day of the Ditch." Amrus' soldiers killed about 700 people that day. Amrus was governor of Toledo until 802.[72][73]
"In 785, Bishop Elipandus of Toledo wrote a letter condemning the teaching of a certain Migetius."[74] In his letter, Elipandus asserted that Christ had adopted his humanity, a position that came to be known as Adoptionism.[75] Two Asturian bishops, Beatus and Eterius, bishop of Osma, wrote a treatise condemning Elipandus' views.[76] Pope Hadrian wrote a letter between 785 and 791 in which he condemned Migetius, but also the terminology used by Elipandus.[77] The Frankish court of Charlemagne also condemned Adoptionism at the Synod of Frankfurt in 794.[78] Although Ramon Abadals y de Vinyals argued that this controversy represented an ideological assertion of independence by the Asturian church against the Moslem-ruled church of Toledo,[79] Collins believes this argument applies eleventh century ideology to the eighth century and is anachronistic.[80] However, Collins notes that the controversy and the alliances formed during it between Asturias and the Franks broke the old unity of the Spanish church.[81] The influence of the bishops of Toledo would be much more limited until the eleventh century.[82]
By the end of the 700s, the Omeyyads had created three frontier districts stretching out from the southern core of their Iberian territories. These were called the Lower March (al-Tagr al-Adna), Central March (al-Tagr al-Awsat), and Upper March (al-Tagr al-A'la). Toledo became the administrative center of the Central March, while Merida became the center of the Lower March and Zaragoza of the Upper March.[83]
Following the death of Abd al-Rahman II, a new revolt broke out in Toledo. The Omeyyad governor was held hostage in order to secure the return of Toledan hostages held in Córdoba. Toledo now engaged in an inter-city feud with the nearby city of Calatrava la Vieja. Toledan soldiers attacked Calatrava, destroyed the walls, and massacred or expelled many inhabitants of Calatrava in 853. Soldiers from Cordoba came to restore the walls and protect Calatrava from Toledo. The new emir, Muhammad I, sent a second army to attack the Toledans, but was defeated. Toledo now made an alliance with King Ordoño I of Asturias. The Toledans and Asturians were defeated at the Battle of Guadacelete, with sources claiming 8000 Toledan and Asturian soldiers were killed and their heads sent back to Cordoba for display throughout Al-Andalus. Despite this defeat, Toledo did not surrender to Cordoba. The Omeyyads reinforced nearby fortresses with cavalry forces to try to contain the Toledans. Toledans attacked Talavera in 857, but were again defeated. In 858 emir Muhammad I personally led an expedition against Toledo and destroyed a bridge, but was unable to take the city. In 859, Muhammad I negotiated a truce with Toledo. Toledo became virtually independent for twenty years, though locked in conflict with neighboring cities. Muhammad I recovered control of Toledo in 873, when he successfully besieged the city and forced it to submit.[84]

The Banu Qasi gained nominal control of the city until 920 and in 932 Abd-ar-Rahman III captured the city following an extensive siege.[85] According to the Chronicle of Alfonso III, Musa ibn Musa of the Banu Qasi had, partly by war and partly by strategy, made himself master of Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca, and Toledo. He had installed his son Lupus (Lubb) as governor of Toledo. King Ordoño I of Asturias fought a series of battles with Musa ibn Musa. According to the Chronicle, Musa ibn Musa allied with his brother-in-law Garcia, identified as Garcia Iñiquez, King of Pamplona. Ordoño defeated Musa's forces at the Battle of Monte Laturce. Musa died of injuries, and his son Lubb submitted to Ordoño's authority in 862 or 863, for the duration of Ordoño's reign (up to 866). Thus, according to the Chronicle of Alfonso III, Toledo was ruled by the Asturian kings. However, Arabic sources do not confirm these campaigns, instead stating that Musa ibn Musa was killed in a failed attack on Guadalajara, and that Andalusi forces repeatedly defeated Asturian forces in the area of Alava from 862 to 866.[86]
By the 870s the Omeyyads had regained control over Toledo. In 878 Al-Mundhir led an expedition against Asturias, of which one of the main components was a force from Toledo. One source portrays this raid as an attack by the 'King of Toledo', but other sources portray it as an Omeyyad raid involving substantial Toledan forces. The forces from Toledo were defeated by Alfonso III of Asturias at the Battle of Polvoraria. Spanish chronicles state that twelve to thirteen thousand in the Toledo army were killed in the battle. Collins states that these figures are "totally unreliable" but demonstrate that Asturian chroniclers thought of this as an important and decisive battle.[87]
In 920s and 930s, the governors of Toledo were in rebellion against the Umayyad regime in Cordoba, led by Abd al-Rahman III. In 930, Abd al-Rahman III, having now adopted the title of caliph, attacked Toledo.[88] The governor of Toledo asked for help from King Ramiro II of Leon, but Ramiro was preocuppied with a civil war against his brother Alfonso IV and was unable to help.[89] In 932, Abd al-Rahman III conquered Toledo, re-establishing control of al-Tagr al-Awsat, the Central March of the Omeyyad state.[90]
In 1009 one of the last Umayyad caliphs, Muhammad II al-Mahdi, fled to Toledo after being expelled from Cordoba by Berber forces backing the rival claimant Sulayman. Al-Mahdi and his Saqaliba general Wadih formed an alliance with the Count of Barcelona and his brother the Count of Urgell. These Catalans joined with Wadih and al-Mahdi in Toledo in 1010 and marched on Cordoba. The combination of Wadih's army and the Catalans defeated the Berbers in a battle outside Cordoba in 1010.[91]
After the fall of the Omeyyad caliphate in the early 11th century, Toledo became an independent taifa kingdom. The population of Toledo at this time was about 28 thousand, including a Jewish population estimated at 4 thousand.[92] The Mozarab community had its own Christian bishop, and after the Christian conquest of Toledo, the city was a destination for Mozarab immigration from the Muslim south.[93] The taifa of Toledo was centered on the Tajo River. The border with the taifa of Badajoz was on the Tajo between Talavera de la Reina and Coria. North, the border was the Sierra de Guadarrama. Northeast, Toledo lands stretched past Guadalajara to Medinaceli. Southeast was the border with the taifa of Valencia, in La Mancha between Cuenca and Albacete. South were the borders with Badajoz around the Mountains of Toledo.[94]
In 1062, Fernando I of Leon and Castile attacked the taifa of Toledo. He conquered Talamanca de Jarama and besieged Alcala de Henares. To secure Fernando's withdrawal, king al-Mamun of Toledo agreed to pay an annual tribute, or parias, to Fernando.[95] Three years later in 1065, al-Mamun invaded the taifa of Valencia through La Mancha, successfully conquering it. Toledo controlled the taifa of Valencia until al-Mamun's death in 1075.[96]
After the death of Fernando I in 1065, the kingdom of Leon and Castilla was divided in three: the kingdoms of Galicia, Leon, and Castilla. The parias that had been paid by Toledo to Fernando I were assigned to the Kingdom of León, which was inherited by Alfonso VI.[97] However, in 1071, Alfonso's older brother Sancho II invaded Leon and defeated his younger brother. Alfonso VI was allowed to go into exile with al-Mamun in Toledo.[98] Alfonso VI was in exile in Toledo approximately from June to October 1071, but after Sancho II was killed later in the same year, Alfonso left Toledo and returned to Leon. Some sources state that al-Mamun forced Alfonso to swear support for al-Mamun and his heirs before allowing him to leave.[99]
In 1074, Alfonso VI campaigned against the taifa of Granada with the assistance of al-Mamun of Toledo. Alfonso received troops from al-Mamun in addition to the parias payment, facilitating his military campaigns. The campaign was successful, and Granada was forced to begin parias payments to Alfonso VI. After this, al-Mamun proceeded to attack Cordoba, which was then under the control of his enemy al-Mutamid, taifa king of Sevilla. He conquered Cordoba in January 1075.[100]
The parias of Toledo to Alfonso VI in the 1070s amounted to approximately 12 thousand gold dinars. This money contributed strongly to Alfonso VI's ability to project military strength throughout the Iberian peninsula.[101]
In 1076, al-Mamun of Toledo was killed in the city of Cordoba, which he had conquered only the year before. The taifa king of Sevilla took the opportunity to reconquer Cordoba and seize other territory on the borderlands between the taifas of Sevilla and Toledo. Al-Mamun was succeeded by his son, al-Qadir, the last taifa king of Toledo. Possibly keeping an earlier promise to al-Mamun, Alfonso VI at first supported the succession of al-Qadir. The taifa of Valencia, which had been conquered by al-Mamun, revolted against al-Qadir and ceased parias payments to Toledo.[102]
Taking advantage of al-Qadir's weakness, al-Mutamid of Sevilla took lands in La Mancha from the taifa of Toledo, and from there conquered the taifas of Valencia and Denia in 1078. After this, al-Qadir lost popularity in Toledo. There was a revolt against him, and he was forced to flee the city and appeal to Alfonso VI for help. The rebels invited the king of Badajoz, al-Mutawakkil, to rule Toledo. The king of Badajoz occupied Toledo in 1079, but Alfonso VI sent forces to help al-Qadir recover Toledo. Alfonso captured the fortress town of Coria, which controlled a pass from Castilian lands into the lands of the taifa of Badajoz. Since Alfonso now threatened him through Coria, al-Mutawakkil withdrew from Toledo and al-Qadir was able to return to Toledo. As the price of his help, Alfonso obtained the right to station two garrisons of his soldiers on the lands of Toledo, at al-Qadir's expense.[103]
A second revolt against al-Qadir took place in 1082. This time al-Qadir defeated the rebels in Toledo, chased them to Madrid, and defeated them there.[104] It was about this time at the latest that Alfonso VI decided to seize Toledo for himself, though some authors have argued that the plan to conquer Toledo existed by 1078.[105] In 1083, Alfonso VI campaigned against al-Mutamid, bringing his forces right up against Sevilla and reaching the city of Tarifa, with the intention of dissuading al-Mutamid from any resistance against the coming seizure of Toledo.[106] In 1084, Alfonso set siege to Toledo, preventing the city from being supplied and also preventing agricultural work in the area. Over the winter of 1084 to 1085 the siege was maintained, while the king spent the winter north in Leon and Sahagun. In spring 1085 Alfonso personally rejoined the siege with new forces. The city soon fell and Alfonso made his triumphant entry to the city on May 24, 1085.
Toledo experienced a period known as La Convivencia, i.e. the co-existence of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Under Islamic Arab rule, Toledo was called Ṭulayṭulah. After the fall of the caliphate, Toledo was the capital city of one of the richest Taifas of Al-Andalus. Its population was overwhelmingly Muladi, and, because of its central location in the Iberian Peninsula, Toledo took a central position in the struggles between the Muslim and Christian rulers of northern Spain. The conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI of Castile in 1085 marked the first time a major city in Al-Andalus was captured by Christian forces; it served to sharpen the religious aspect of the Christian reconquest.

On May 25, 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile took Toledo and established direct personal control over the Moorish city from which he had been exacting tribute, ending the medieval Taifa's Kingdom of Toledo. This was the first concrete step taken by the combined kingdom of Leon-Castile in the Reconquista by Christian forces. After Castilian conquest, Toledo continued to be a major cultural centre; its Arab libraries were not pillaged, and a tag-team translation centre was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Toledo served as the capital city of Castile intermittently (Castile did not have a permanent capital) from 1085, and the city flourished. Charles I of Spain's court was set in Toledo, serving as the imperial capital.[107] However, in 1561, in the first years of his son Philip II of Spain reign, the Spanish court was moved to Madrid, thus letting the city's importance dwindle until the late 20th century, when it became the capital of the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha. Nevertheless, the economic decline of the city helped to preserve its cultural and architectural heritage. Today, because of this rich heritage, Toledo is one of Spain's foremost cities, receiving thousands of visitors yearly. Under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638 CE) occurred; the Kingdom of Toledo followed up on this tradition (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486–1490 CE) including forced conversions and mass murder and the rioting and blood bath against the Jews of Toledo (1212 CE).[108][109]
During the persecution of the Jews in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, members of the Jewish community of Toledo produced texts on their long history in Toledo. It was at this time that Don Isaac Abrabanel, a prominent Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century and one of the king's trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, wrote that Toledo was named Ṭulayṭulah by its first Jewish inhabitants who, he stated, settled there in the 5th century BCE, and which name – by way of conjecture – may have been related to its Hebrew cognate טלטול (= wandering), on account of their wandering from Jerusalem. He says, furthermore, that the original name of the city was Pirisvalle, so-called by its early pagan inhabitants.[110] However, there is no archaeological or historical evidence for Jewish presence in this region prior to the time of the Roman Empire; when the Romans first wrote about Toledo it was a Celtic city.[111][112]

Modern Era[edit]
Toledo's Alcázar (Latinized Arabic word for palace-castle, from the Arabic القصر, al-qasr) became renowned in the 19th and 20th centuries as a military academy. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, its garrison was famously besieged by Republican forces.
Climate[edit]
Toledo has a typical cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk). Winters are cool while summers are hot and dry. Precipitation is low and mainly concentrated in the period mid autumn through to mid spring. The highest temperature ever recorded in Toledo was 43.1 °C or 109.58 °F on 10 August 2012; the lowest was −9.1 °C or 15.6 °F on 27 January 2005.

Economy[edit]

The metal-working industry has historically been Toledo's economic base, with a great tradition in the manufacturing of swords and knives and a significant production of razor blades, medical devices and electrical products. Soap and toothpaste industries, flour milling, glass and ceramics have also been important.[114] (The Toledo Blade, the American newspaper in Toledo's Ohio namesake city, is named in honor of the sword-making tradition.)

According to the Statistical Institute of Castilla-La Mancha, in 2007 the distribution of employment by sectors of occupation was as follows: 86.5% of the population engaged in the services, 6.6% in construction, 5.4% in industry and 1.5% in agriculture and livestock.[115]

The manufacture of swords in the city of Toledo goes back to Roman times, but it was under Moorish rule and during the Reconquista that Toledo and its guild of sword-makers played a key role. Between the 15th and 17th centuries the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where its products came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of King Carlos III. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers guilds of the city and it was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Carlos III commissioned the architect Sabatini to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.




Historical swords and souvenirs of Toledo.


In the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and after the Spanish Civil War, to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units. Following the closure of the factory in the 1980s, the building was renovated to house the campus of the Technological University of Castilla-La Mancha in Toledo.[116]

Unemployment[edit]
In the last decade, unemployment in absolute terms has remained fairly stable in the city of Toledo, but in 2009 this figure increased significantly: nearly 62% compared to 2008, with the number of unemployed rising from 2,515 to 4,074 (figures at 31 March each year), according to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha.[118] Of this 62%, one third of the increase took place in the first quarter.
According to other statistics from the same source, almost half the unemployed in the city of Toledo (1,970 persons) are among those whose education does not go beyond the compulsory secondary level. However, there are groups whose level of studies is such that they have not been registered as unemployed, such as those who have completed class 1 professional training, or those with virtually nonexistent unemployment rates (less than 0.1%), which is the case of unemployed with high school degrees or professional expertise.
The largest group among the unemployed is those who have no qualifications (27.27%).
Politics[edit]

Toledo City Hall.


Toledo has a 25-member City Council, elected by closed lists every four years. The 2011 election saw a pact made between the 11 members of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the 2 members of the United Left, to retain the position of the PSOE's Emiliano García-Page Sánchez as mayor, which he has been since 2007.
Culture[edit]
The old city is located on a mountaintop with a 150 degree view, surrounded on three sides by a bend in the Tagus River, and contains many historical sites, including the Alcázar, the cathedral (the primate church of Spain), and the Zocodover, a central market place.
From the 4th century to the 16th century about thirty synods were held at Toledo. The earliest, directed against Priscillian, assembled in 400. At the synod of 589 the Visigothic King Reccared declared his conversion from Arianism to Catholicism; the synod of 633 decreed uniformity of catholic liturgy throughout the Visigothic kingdom and took stringent measures against baptized Jews who had relapsed into their former faith. Other councils forbade circumcision, Jewish rites and observance of the Sabbath and festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font.[119] The council of 681 assured to the archbishop of Toledo the primacy of Spain. At Guadamur, very close to Toledo, was dug in 1858 the Treasure of Guarrazar, the best example of Visigothic art in Spain.
As nearly one hundred early canons of Toledo found a place in the Decretum Gratiani, they exerted an important influence on the development of ecclesiastical law. The synod of 1565–1566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the Council of Trent; and the last council held at Toledo, 1582–1583, was guided in detail by Philip II.
Toledo was famed for religious tolerance and had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were expelled from Spain in 1492 (Jews) and 1502 (Mudejars). Today's city contains the religious monuments the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca, the Synagogue of El Transito, Mosque of Cristo de la Luz and the church of San Sebastián dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, in their various diasporas, the family name Toledano is still prevalent—indicating an ancestry traced back to this city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various Spanish-speaking countries).
In the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of Alfonso X, called "El Sabio" ("the Wise") for his love of learning. The Toledo School of Translators, that had commenced under Archbishop Raymond of Toledo, continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The Palacio de Galiana, built in the Mudéjar style, is one of the monuments that remain from that period.
The Cathedral of Toledo (Catedral de Toledo) was built between 1226–1493 and modeled after the Bourges Cathedral, though it also combines some characteristics of the Mudéjar style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features the Baroque altar called El Transparente, several stories high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and multiple colors of marble, a masterpiece of medieval mixed media by Narciso Tomé topped by the daily effect for just a few minutes of a shaft of light from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tajo, the Alcántara bridge and the later built San Martín bridge.
The Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes is a Franciscan monastery, built 1477–1504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with Mudéjar ornamentation.
Toledo was home to El Greco for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, exhibited in the Church of Santo Tomé.
When Philip II moved the royal court from Toledo to Madrid in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.
Toledo steel[edit]
Toledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BC, and came to the attention of Rome when used by Hannibal in the Punic Wars. Soon, it became a standard source of weaponry for Roman Legions.[120]
Toledo steel was famed for its very high quality alloy,[121] whereas Damascene steel, a competitor from the Middle Ages on, was famed for a specific metal-working technique.[122]
Today there is a significant trade, and many shops offer all kinds of swords to their customers, whether historical or modern films swords, as well as medieval armors and from other times, which are also exported to other countries.
Gastronomy[edit]

Toledo's cuisine is grouped with that of Castile–La Mancha, well-set in its traditions and closely linked to hunting and grazing. A good number of recipes are the result of a combination of Moorish and Christian influences.
Some of its specialties include lamb roast or stew, cochifrito, alubias con perdiz (beans with partridge) and perdiz estofoda (partridge stew), carcamusa, migas, gachas manchegas, and tortilla a la magra. Two of the city's most famous food productions are Manchego cheese and marzipan, which has a Protected Geographical Indication (mazapán de Toledo).[123][124]
Holidays[edit]

Since the Civil War, most of the steps were burned or destroyed, so it had to create new steps or using images from other churches and convents Toledo. Being a city Toledo Castile, Holy Week is characterized as austere and introspective, as well as beauty, due in part to the beautiful framework in which it takes place: Toledo. Many people take advantage of the Easter break to visit the monastery churches that are only open to the general public at this time of year. [42]
Corpus Christi: Feast declared International Tourist Interest. Its origins lie in the thirteenth century and is probably the most beautiful Corpus Christi there. The processional cortege travels around two kilometres (1.2 miles) of streets and richly decorated awnings. In recent years, following the transfer of the traditional holiday Thursday present Sunday, was chosen to conduct two processions, one each of these days, with certain differences in members and protocol between them. [43]

To mark the fourth centenary of the publication of the first part of Don Quixote, the Council of Communities of Castile–La Mancha designed a series of routes through the region crossing the various points cited in the novel. Known as the Route of Don Quixote, two of the pathways designated, sections 1 and 8, are based in Toledo; those linking the city with La Mancha Castile and Montes de Toledo exploit the natural route which passes through the Cigarrales and heads to Cobisa, Nambroca Burguillos of Toledo, where it takes the Camino Real from Sevilla to suddenly turn towards Mascaraque Almonacid de Toledo, deep into their surroundings, near Mora, in La Mancha.
This stretch, Mascaraque-Toledo, of the Route of Don Quixote has recently been included in an official way on the Camino de Santiago in Levantine branch with origins in Cartagena, Alicante and Valencia, as both routes are declared a European Cultural Route on this stretch.
Infrastructure[edit]




Cambrón Gate.


Toledo has long been an obligatory stop in the centre of the peninsula. The roads leading to historic Toledo are still used and in many cases have provided the basis to existing roads leading into the city.
Roads[edit]
From Toledo part of N-400, which links this city with Cuenca by Ocaña and Tarancón. It is currently in the process of transformation in the future A-40 motorway Castilla La Mancha, which will link Maqueda (where it joins the motorway Extremadura), Toledo, Ocaña (where it attaches to the Motorway of Andalusia), Tarancón (where connects with the motorway Levante), Cuenca and Teruel.
The old National Road 401 Madrid-Toledo-Ciudad Real was transformed in the late 1980s in the current A-42 as a result of splitting and deleting the path that the various crossings counted (Illescas, Yuncos, etc.. ).
The split path can take 7 kilometres (4 miles) south of Toledo, in effect Ciudad Real, where it continues as conventional road. At this point, the A-42 connects with the Highway of the Vineyard that reaches Tomelloso. It is planned to extend the A-42, by a toll road, to Ciudad Real and Jaén.
In the early twenty-first century was built, in order to decongest the access of Madrid, the toll motorway AP-41.
Another way of State Highway Network that Toledo is part of the N-403, Toledo-Maqueda – Ávila – Adanero. Part of the route of this road will be replaced by that of the aforementioned Highway of Castilla La Mancha.
In addition to these roads, from Toledo depart several regional and provincial-level linking the capital with the regions of Montes de Toledo, La Jara and La Mancha.
Rail[edit]




Toledo Railway Station.


In the mid-nineteenth century Toledo was one of the first Spanish cities to receive rail service, being attached to the Madrid – Aranjuez line which was inaugurated by Isabella II on June 12 of 1858. The current station is in Neo-Mudéjar style, and was inaugurated on April 24 of 1919. It is a remarkably beautiful building, especially the paneling in the main hall of the same.
With several ups and downs in terms of technical equipment and services this is the line that served the city until the early twenty-first century: on July 2 of 2003 the last conventional train service between the two capitals ended and work began on the high-speed link, Madrid – Toledo, which entered service on November 16 of 2005, thanks to which travel time to Madrid has been reduced to just under 30 minutes.
Health[edit]




Hospital of Tavera (built between 1541–1603).


In the early 1960s began the construction of the Residence Health Social Security "Virgen de la Salud". The original building still remains in use, although successive extensions were added (maternity, outpatient clinics, operating rooms, etc.) into the existing complex. The complex was also extended to move the clinic to a new nearby building, now converted into Specialty Centre San Ildefonso.
On October 6, 1974 inaugurated the National Hospital of Paraplegics who becomes the centre of reference, both nationally and internationally, in the treatment of these lesions. Also carries out a major work of social integration of their patients.
The transfer of powers from the state health at the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha will give new impetus to the health infrastructure, manifested in 2007 with the commencement of construction of the new General Hospital of Toledo in the Santa Mary Benquerencia. Also have been provided to the different parts of the relevant health centres.
In the Toledo Hospital Complex [36] is also integrated Geriatric Hospital Virgen del Valle, a result of reform and modernization of old tuberculosis hospital built in the mid twentieth century. The centre is located outside the city, near the Parador Nacional de Turismo Conde de Orgaz.
With regard to private health, at present the city of Toledo has several centres: Hospital de las Tres Culturas, Clínica Nuestra Señora del Rosario, and so on.

Toledo suffered from a shortage of sports facilities.[citation needed] Much of this problem was resolved when the Central School of Physical Education of the Army moved its headquarters to the premises of the Academy of Infantry. In the 1990s, the city council took over the old facilities of the military centre, which now include an athletics track, Olympic swimming pool and an indoor sports hall, from the former military installations, and numerous outdoor courts built in the area of the former runway of application, having been demolished and the old gym complex pools (indoor and outdoor).
