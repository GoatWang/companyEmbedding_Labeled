generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in  apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system  a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities it remained the architectural basis for the classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between  and  as the first golden age of the macintosh apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh in the s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii the apple iie was discontinued in  – decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in  the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line and the illfated performa series this led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the s including digital cameras portable cd audio players speakers video consoles the eworld online service and tv appliances enormous resources were also invested in the problemplagued newton division based on john sculleys unrealistic market forecastscitation needed ultimately none of these products helped and apples market share and stock prices continued to slidecitation needed throughout this period microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued microsoft for using a gui similar to the apple lisa in apple computer inc v microsoft corp the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed at this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apples reputation and sculley was replaced as ceo by michael spindler the newton was apples first foray into the pda markets as well

themes for the bitten logo and jobs immediately took a liking to it however jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company the logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry the colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible and to represent the fact the apple ii could generate graphics in color this logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to alan turing with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide both janoff and apple deny any homage to turing in the design of the logo on august   the year following

many apple stores are located inside shopping malls but apple has built several standalone flagship stores in highprofile locations it has been granted design patents and received architectural awards

acquisitions by apple braeburn capital and filemaker inc corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has a directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon as an example when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apples official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app he was forced to resign unlike other major us companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in  apple had  fulltime employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware companies cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the macs early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late s beginning with apples adoption of the pci bus in the  power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wifi nvme pcie and others in its products firewire is an appleoriginated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee  and is a legally mandated port in all cable tv boxes in the united states apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the indian market in july  during a conference call with investors ceo

to getting product to market in october  indian apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and storewithinastore concepts in an effort to expand further into the

receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country in march the wall street journal reported that apple would begin manufacturing iphone models in india over the next two months and in may the journal wrote that an apple manufacturer had begun production of iphone se in the country while apple told cnbc that the manufacturing was for a small number of units labor practices further information criticism of apple inc § labor practices the company advertised its products as being made in america until the late s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the s almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the usa is no longer a viable option for most apple products in  the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions of the chinese factories where contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod the article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the ipod and other items had

worlds largest contract electronics manufacturer for clients including apple at the time the suicides drew media attention and employment practices at foxconn were investigated by apple apple issued a public statement about the suicides and company spokesperson steven dowling said apple is saddened and upset by the recent suicides at foxconn  a team from apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made the statement was released after the results from the companys probe into its suppliers labor practices were published in early  foxconn was not specifically named in the report but apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws including apples own rules and some child labor existed in a number of factories apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides also in  workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses after a high suicide rate in a foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones albeit a lower rate than that of china as a whole workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to nhexane a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products a  bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted despite apples promise to reform factory practice after the  foxconn suicides the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since  apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions in december  the institute for global labour and human rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the  workers at a zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen china which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for apples iphone

netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in hightax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of lowtax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october   which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only  percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and the cocacola company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax it is a matter of public record that apple inc is the single largest taxpayer to the department of the treasury of the

investigation by the eus competition commissioner that concluded that apple received illegal state aid from ireland the eu ordered apple to pay  billion euros  billion plus interest in unpaid taxes specifically the commissioner found that apple had benefitted from irish department of revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by apple sales international internally between its irish branch and a stateless head office entity lacking employees or premises permitted under irish law until  the chancellor of austria christian kern put this decision into perspective by
