ranks as vp product management we’re thrilled to introduce our newest taptican an experienced leader with degrees in business administration computer science executive education and strategic marketing management as well as years of industry experience at haystackz flash networks comverse and emblaze with a passion for technology products and offroad bikes tal is ready to drive taptica’s game plan to the next level   “until now the market has been fragmented making it hard to develop coherent products however as things begin to consolidate more efficient tools can be developed resulting in higher conversion rates and lower costs for advertisers” says tal   but why the major shift presently the ad tech industry is a given as the world becomes increasingly mobilefirst and connected embracing programmatic is no longer a leap of faith but a reality this has pushed traditionally marketfocused organizations to fall flat as they squander their resources on further dissecting an already defined market the resulting move toward a stronger product focus is critical as the key issue facing the mobile ad tech industry is no longer about attracting new users to join the market but addressing the specific needs therein still this is not to say that taptica will be straying from our consumersided focus either while product is certainly a key focal point we still appreciate the importance of taking all sides into consideration for fullyinformed decision making and improvement a keen market focus will always be essential to stay on top of the latest mobile innovations as taptica continues to lead the ranks in product growth and development you can expect to see tal’s energized vision take center stage as he pioneers new initiatives to perfect the
