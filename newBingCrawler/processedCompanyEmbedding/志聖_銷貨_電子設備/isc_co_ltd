capability of developing and manufacturing the highly customized semiconductor test socket isc co ltd offers the total test solution by way of technical innovation referring to integrated silicone contactor isc test socket takes advantage of the silky silicone to prevent harming the semiconductor much improved from the conventional test socket pogo pintype to realize the unique concept for the highly innovative product featured by isc test socket is its thinner structure than the conventional one for prompt signal transfer isc test socket is compatible with the micropitch semiconductors below um while successfully retaining the greatest part of current isc nsk micro precision co ltdproduct information from miniature ball bearings to subassembly unit products we provide a complete range of products for various needs home  product information miniature ball bearings have become essential components in the rotating elements of various equipments and machines in response to the trend toward equipment and machinery that gets smaller more compact thinner and quieter we manufacture hundreds of kinds of miniature ball bearings including specialized types from extremely small bearings with a  mm bore diameter and a  mm outer diameter to bearings that are about  mm in outer diameter consist of inner ring outer ring balls retainer and cage this type is the most generally used radial ball bearings for many applications extrathinsection deep grove ball bearings have a small radial crosssectional thickness they are used when extreme compactness is important deep groove ball bearings with extended inner rings are inch series bearings with their inner rings extended equally on both sides beyond the width of the outer ring this feature simplifies the design and fabrication of parts closely surrounding the bearing thrust ball bearing consists of flat washers without raceway groove and ballinstalled cage this type can support an axial load only from one direction this type has a raceway grove on both washers and holds a higher load rating pivot ball bearing consists of outer ring and several balls this type supports a tapered tip pivot of normally ° of spinning shaft deep groove ball bearings with flanged outer rings is a type that the flange extends around the entire circumference of the outer ring this feature simplifies a process of the mounting of the bearing into housing downsizing the ball screw supporting bearing with miniature size bearing for actuators and ball screw supporting unit iscs newly developed material tbn achieves much higher performance on corrosion resistance over existing stainless steel of susc this has been materialized by the optimum addition of four chemical elements and fine adjustment on the content of other minimal elements moreover higher mechanical flexibility is added on the material through our original heat treatment technology with these features this material can be expected to be widely applied starting from sea craft and fishing applications which are to be exposed on salt water to the outdoor machinery devices best solution for the machineries in outdoor saltwater and highly corrosive chemical environment   in order to minimize the stress of patients dental hand piece is required to hold high level of ultra high speed rotation and the lowest vibration isc has developed a dental bearing with ultra high speed rotation and lowest running torque in order to meet these requirements from the market in order to respond the market demand promptly isc has a full line of standardized dental bearing isc produces customized dental bearing which fits in all designs from major hand piece brands isc products comprise miniature ball bearings and high precision processing unit subassemblies utilizing our expertise obtained through manufacturing many types of ball bearings we achieve high precision and quality at a low cost we offer you the best solution both for selecting the most appropriate bearing and for designing a surrounding structure of bearing miniature ball bearing with moldedpushedup plastic on its outside face this type is widely applicable to various machineries which require precise guiding high precision ball bearing mounted with precisely processed parts this type provide a high running accuracy and is applied to magnetic tape device consists of a pair of inhouse made ultrasmall bearing housing and shaft this unit is applied to an actuator arm of hdd improves and supports a need for a precise fitting between shaft and bearing an extra small size cam follower mounted with inhouse made high precision miniature ball bearings miniature ball bearing with polyurethane rubber heatsealed directly on its outer diameter liner motion products with high precision miniature ball bearings high load capability roller type smooth linear motion product mounted with croxy applicable to belt type actuator high rigidity small support unit
