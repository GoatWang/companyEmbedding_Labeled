yeargarb has developed a system intended to recover rubber from used large offtheroad tires and has the rights to act as the nonunited states agent for technology for the remediation of radioactive

preseparating plant with the potential to process approximately  metric tons of ewaste per year a small garb ewaste plant requires  square feet of warehouse spaceeach garb ewaste plant can stand alone as a single economic unit in terms of revenue and profit in other words with one plant — revenue can be generated from that one plantrevenue is generated by reselling the copper the aluminum the plastics and the metals these are priced by market demandcurrently market demand for these products are copper  unusable waste  aluminum  plastic  metals average per ton  precious metals are contained in a variety of computer related products including electronics such as computer circuitry boards which are found in computers laser printers copiers papx systems faxes mobile phones microwaves and other every day productsat the lowest end of the revenue spectrum a sample garb presorting ewaste plant processing  metric tons of ewaste per year can be anticipated to produce roughly  m annual gross revenue this does not include government subsidies currently available to garbgarb’s computer waste scrap recycling plant is capable of handling two metric tons per hour of throughput and comes with a full buyback agreement on all throughput produced garb will sign a full long term buyback agreement on all output produced this plant is an effective option for both the national and international market the efficiency and cost will make the plant attractive to low cost startup companies interested in contributing to lowering the environmental impact of electronic wastee waste as a financial resourcesewaste is today both an important resource of primary raw material and a large percentage of hazardous waste further due to its very nature ewaste in all its streams tends to be voluminous in considering all of the above the collection handling disposing and processing of ewaste is a difficult and involving joba garb ewaste facility will collect the ewaste pre sort it and separate it the garb presorting ewaste plant sets aside all hazardous materials sorting and separating any and all easily accessible raw material such as copper aluminum and plastic furthermore this process will significantly reduce the voluminous impact of the waste as a wholethe garb ewaste presorting plant facilitates large waste management companies into channeling their ewaste to garb in doing so such companies extend the life of the landfill limit the amount hazardous material that actually flows to a landfill by converging ewaste to a garb plant large waste management companies also increase the life of the landfill as they reduce or eliminate the voluminous material that actually flows into the landfillgarb benefits from the revenue generated from sales and also further benefits from sharing agreements on the collections feesestablishing four plantsin regards to revenue growth garb’s strategy is to build own and manage its own plants revenues from this area is not anticipated to begin to flow until  qtr garb is actively involved in raising the money needed to establish its first four plants fund raising will be completed by the end of  with the first plant being delivered by end  qtr  the plants will reflect garb technology and know how garb does not expect any result here if any until the end of the year at the earliest garb expects its engineering division to drive sales in  with the ewaste plants once funded starting to participate in revenue from qtr  garb noted on october   that it expect to have a further update in  weeksgarb is considering building  ewaste plants in the united states between  and   each of these plants will process roughly  metric tons of output generating revenues in excess of  per plant with net profits in excess of  per yeargarb’s goal is to build own and manage  ewaste plants per year generating revenues in of  in the first full year of operation and with average  return on net profit the yearly contribution from the plants will position garb to take advantage of the growth of ewaste as both a resource and a raw material opening opportunity for expansions in europe central and south america middle east asia and the indian sub

worldwidegarb financial outlookgarb has come through a tough financial period but sees the economy turning with some interest being generated especially from overseas inquiries and expects some small orders from their engineering division from qtr next year and building from thereit has taken garb almost  months to organize and restructure this has created more efficient and nimble company capable

technology and development of the ewaste industry this industry as long term potential over  tons per year of ewaste will be produced by the us from ewaste will add to the over  tons of ewaste that the world market will be producing making ewaste  industry world wideewaste outlookewaste is one of the waste industry’s most important and strategically essential waste stream the united states will see a growth in ewaste from the current  tons per year to over  tons per year by  this makes ewaste the fastest growing waste stream in the industrygarb oil  power corporation is dedicated to the

it in its various components and reutilize each of the components to create another new or similar product leaving no waste this principle can be adapted to any technology or any productgarb has chosen the waste industry and within this industryrubber waste electronic waste waste to energy closedcycle will produce no waste as ideally input equals  of output this alleviates pressure on the

recycling systemsgarb offers turnkey solutions for electronic waste plants and is one of the leading project suppliers for ewaste plantselectronic waste is the fastestgrowing waste sector in the world and most people think of precious metals used in electronic equipment they think of silver and gold but even more costly metals such as platinum palladium ruthenium gold silver and iridium are also important elements primarily in producing corrosion free contacts because all these metals are both costly and scarce recycling them is an important process in recovering these precious metals for reuseinstead of using a high speed hammer mill to fraction the waste stream garb uses a slow speed fractioner to make sure a high range of sizes from too small to too big is avoided this avoids a lot of fines from valuable goods as plastics and metal leaves the process into the other streamsgarb is able eg in recovering  recyclables of household appliances with a pre separation process fridges can be recycled as well by extracting the liquid freon in pipes and compressors and by separating the foam where nearly  of the fcw is encapsulated the remaining material can be treated by the same
