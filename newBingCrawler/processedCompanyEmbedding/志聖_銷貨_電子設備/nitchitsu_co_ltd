relates to a denitrifying composition for microbially removing nitrate nitrogen and also to a process for producing the same the denitrifying composition is used for purifying water or as a substrate for culture medium in cultivation of microorganisms background technologyamong technologies for removing nitrate nitrogen intended for the purification of water heterotrophic denitrification with the use of methanol or an organic carbon source in sludge as a hydrogen donor has been known this process is influenced by decomposing systems other than the target microorganisms and its denitrifying efficiency per substrate is low however it is capable of removing nitrates nitrogen relatively simply and is put to practical use in those treating facilities which are strictly controlled not to discharge methanol or sludge to the outside after its use in denitrification that is the denitrifying operation according to this process cannot be completed by merely passing water to be treated through a single denitrifying tank and requires many treating steps and tanks and facilitiesin consequence it has been difficult to apply this process to effluent of underdrains in farms the effluent in question contains nitrogenous components mostly consisting of inorganic nitrate nitrogen and the concentration of nitrate nitrogen has become an issue in recent years moreover there is the possibility of newly generating water pollution unless a denitrifying substrate is injected precisely in an amount conforming to the flow rate of the effluent under treatment and to the amount of nitrate nitrogen therein contained and the operation of heterotrophic denitrification requires equipment and fulltime careful control such as installed and practiced in a sewage treating plantin contrast autotrophic denitrification with the use of sulfur or a sulfur compound is limited to denitrification by sulfuroxidizing bacteria hence it is effected at a high denitrifying efficiency per substrate and produces sulfate ions which are not limiting factors of water quality thus the process offers an advantage that where the content of sulfate ions is  or less the treated water can be discharged as it is after control of its ph by a calcium compoundan example of sulfuroxidizing bacteria is thiobacillus denitrificans and a reaction represented by the following equation is known s  no  ho  co  hco  nh  chno  n  so  h a number of processes for autotrophic denitrification with the use of sulfur or a sulfur compound have been proposed for example in the following patent literature jp japan patent  b  jp  b  jp  b  jp  b  jp  b  jp  a jp  a  jp  a and jp  a of the aforementioned processes those described in jp  b  and jp  b  have been developed for treating effluent containing a variety of nitrogen compounds and sulfur compounds and respectively require a pretreatment at ph  or less or a step for cultivating activated sludge seeded with a group of sulfuroxidizing bacteria as dominant in consequence they cannot be said to be efficient in the case where the principal target of denitrification is nitrate nitrogenthe processes described in jp  b  and jp  b  although not limited to denitrification aimed at nitrate nitrogen respectively carry out denitrification by sulfuroxidizing bacteria in the denitrification step following the nitrification step however they cannot carry out autotrophic denitrification efficiently because a sulfur component needs to be added in an amount conforming to that of nitrate nitrogen in the object to be treated or minute bubbles of nitrogen gas produced by denitrification cannot discharge by themselves and their discharge separately requires an aeration tankthe process described in jp  b  relates to simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphoric acid from effluent with the use of marble composed of calcium carbonate and sulfur particles however the particles of marble and sulfur are not used in the same step and the process is fundamentally an aerobicanaerobic activated sludge treatment therefore unlike autotrophic denitrification with sulfur alone as denitrifying substrate the process requires control of sludge and is not efficient for direct denitrification of nitrate nitrogenthe process described in jp  a  is fundamentally an anaerobicaerobic activated sludge treatment but it performs more stably in removal of nitrate nitrogen than the aforementioned processes because of the introduction of sodium hydrogen carbonate or calcium carbonate as carbon source the process however is not efficient for direct denitrification of nitrate nitrogen since it is low in denitrifying efficiency on account of pyrites being used as sulfur source and besides it remains in the category of activated sludge processes requiring a number of treating tanksthe process described in jp  a  relates to autotrophic denitrification by sulfuroxidizing bacteria with sodium hydrogen carbonate or calcium carbonate supplied as carbon source and a thiosulfate salt used as sulfur source and electron donor the thiosulfate salt must be injected in an amount conforming to that of nitrate nitrogen in the object to be treated and like the aforementioned the process is not efficient for direct denitrification of nitrate nitrogenthe process disclosed in jp  a  relates to autotrophic denitrification by sulfuroxidizing bacteria as a pretreatment in purification of water in this case as well the efficiency drops markedly unless sodium sulfite is added in an amount conforming to that of the object of denitrification contained in raw water and the process cannot be adapted easily to direct denitrification of nitrate nitrogenany one of the processes described thus far does not aim at direct denitrification of nitrate nitrogen as its object and most of them are no better than activated sludge processes and inefficient from the standpoint of denitrification on the contrary the process described in jp  a  can remove nitrate nitrogen efficiently by sulfuroxidizing bacteriathis process however uses sulfur powder that is highly reactive toward sulfuroxidizing bacteria and effects denitrification by passing raw water containing nitrate nitrogen and the like through a fluidized bed reactor vessel in which a layer filled with sulfur powder is formed motive power is necessary to release nitrogen gas adhering to and between the sulfur particles in the course of denitrification and unless the gas is released the sulfur particles exhibiting good denitrifying efficiency become wrapped in bubbles and cannot participate in denitrification any longer the same is true for the bubbles between particles other difficulties are a necessity for separate correction of the acidity of sulfuric acid being formed and a necessity for forced passage of raw water at all times to prevent the occurrence of high acidity which would stop the denitrificationthus general application of this process for example to the treatment of effluent of underdrains would be difficult to realize because it would incur considerable capital and running costsin addition the aforementioned processes do not provide any concrete measures for supply of carbon source which is just as important as sulfur source and for control of the ph namely keeping the ph in the vicinity of  in order to maintain the activity of sulfuroxidizing bacteria and effect denitrification with certaintyrecent knowledge obtained in a learned society for water treatment suggests the importance of taking the following actions in order to effect denitrification smoothly by sulfuroxidizing bacteriathat is it is essential to accelerate the multiplication of sulfuroxidizing bacteria in order to sustain the denitrification reaction by the bacteria in question and to accomplish this it is necessary to supply with certainty carbon source that is required for the synthesis of bacteria in addition to sulfur that is a source of nutrient and to control the ph generally at  or higher to maintain the microbial activity reference should be made to  removal of nitrate nitrogen from actual sewage by denitrification with sulfur the th national meeting for presentation of researches on water supply may  abstracts of papers pp   section of water purification japan water supply society however it is not always necessary to keep the ph at  or more as will be described belowas illustrated above the most efficient way for safe removal of nitrate nitrogen is autotrophic denitrification by sulfuroxidizing bacteria but it has been difficult to produce surely and easily the effect of this processaccordingly an object of this invention is to provide a denitrifying composition for microbially removing nitrate nitrogen which does not require supply of a carbon source that is essential to microorganisms exhibits a good balance in the system before and after the reaction reduces the influences of ph and chemical substances to the water area

calcium carbonate powdered or crushed limestone powdered or crushed seashell powdered or crushed fossil of seashell powdered or crushed dolomite and powdered or crushed coral and they may be used either singly or as a mixture of two kinds or morecalcium carbonate or a substance mainly consisting of calcium carbonate to be used for producing a denitrifying composition of this invention is prepared as powder with a specific surface area of  cmg preferably  cmg by air permeability determination the dispersibility to sulfur decreases if the specific surface area is too large or too small an average particle size of less than  mm is beneficial to good dispersibilitysulfur contained in a denitrifying composition of this invention is preferably amorphous sulfur that is obtained by rapidly cooling molten sulfur sulfur to be used for producing a denitrifying composition of this invention is under no restriction as long as it can be melted and solidified by rapid cooling for example sulfur recovered in a plant for desulfurizing petroleum or coal and natural sulfur are useful either as solid such as powder and granule or molten and such sulfur may contain contaminantsa microporous substance contained in a denitrifying composition of this invention is any substance with pores suitable for sulfuroxidizing bacteria to settle in preferably a mineral product or a processed product thereof and a carbide mineral products or processed products thereof include kieselguhr calcined kieselguhr tuff kokaseki perlite pearlite porous ceramic brick alc pumice stone pozzolan shirasu shirasu balloon calcined expanded shale attapulgite sepiolite cristobalite sericite acid clay and illite carbides are carbonaceous materials such as charcoal and include charcoal carbon derived from coconut shell carbon derived from rice hull coke carbon derived from bamboo and activated carbon other microporous substances include volcanic ashes soil fly ash cement and concretethe water content in a microporous substance to be used in the production of a denitrifying composition of this invention is preferably  or less while the particle size is preferably  mm or less more preferably  mm or less in length however carbon derived from rice hull uncaked shirasu uncaked volcanic ashes and uncaked soil may be used with no particular adjustment of the particle sizea microporous sustance contained in a denitrifying composition of this invention may advantageously be a cation exchanger such cation exchangers include natural zeolites synthetic zeolites and bentonite a cation exchanger when substituted for a microporous substance can remove ammoniacal nitrogen from effluent by adsorption and besides can hold the negatively charged microorganisms in the denitrifying composition by adsorbing calcium ions produced by the denitrification reaction if necessary it is possible to add sand slag and others to a denitrifying composition of this invention to the extent that the function of the composition is not adversely affectedthe ratio of sulfur to calcium carbonate in a denitrifying composition of this invention is not restricted as long as the sulfur works as a binder or matrix and gives a solid with a certain degree of strength but the ratio by weight of sulfur to calcium carbonate is preferably  to  more preferably  to  both sulfur and calcium carbonate serve as nutritents and gradually diminish and it is not advantageous to set the ratio in such a manner as to markedly destroy the balance of the two the amount of sulfur is kept in the range  preferably  of the whole even in the cases where a microporous substance and others are added a more preferable proportion is  parts by weight of sulfur  parts by weight of calcium carbonate or a substance mainly comprising thereof and  parts by weight of a microporous substancewhere a cation exchanger is used as a microporous substance zeolite is substituted to an amount corresponding to  preferably  or so of calcium carbonate while bentonite is substituted to an amount corresponding to  preferably  or so of calcium carbonatethere is no particular restriction to the shape of a denitrifying composition of this invention but it is advantageous for the composition to have a certain size and a surface area as large as possible in order to increase the contact area with raw water or effluent to be treated and to prevent the composition itself from flowing out therefore a preferable shape is massive granular or molded the molded form here means a form with a specific shape such as plate bar and honeycomb in case of a mass a particle diameter of  mm produces the anticipated effect faster than those with a particle diameter of  mm or  mm but a smaller diameter has a larger possibility of blocking and flowout loss hence the optimal size varies with the mode of usagethe average particle diameter for a longterm industrial use is adequately  mm and is advantageously kept below  mma denitrifying composition of this invention is produced as follows where sulfur calcium carbonate or a substance comprising mainly thereof and a microporous substance are used they are mixed the sulfur is melted by heating at  deg c preferably  deg c the mixture is rapidly cooled for example by throwing it into water and the resulting solid is crushed or granulatedinstead of melting sulfur by heating sulfur melted in advance may be used that is sulfur is melted first calcium carbonate a microporous substance and other substances to be added as needed are added mixed and rapidly cooled during this operation it is preferable to add calcium carbonate a microporous substance and other substances in the form of powder or granule as mentioned earlier here the specific surface area of calcium carbonate in use is  cmg preferably  cmg by air permeability determination alarger particle size is more advantageous where calcium carbonate is used in a larger amount and calcium carbonate with a particle diameter of  mm or so can be used up to approximately three times the amount of sulfurcalcium carbonate with a smaller particle diameter is more effective for enhancing the activity of microorganisms but a specific surface area in excess of  cmg by air permeability determination decreases the bulk specific gravity and it becomes difficult for calcium carbonate to coexist in an amount required for maintaining the ph at a neutral level with a specific surface area of  cmg it is possible to obtain not only good granules or masses but also the coexistence of calcium carbonate and sulfur at a weight ratio of approximately  the ratio of calcium carbonate to sulfur is  parts by weight preferably  parts by weight more preferably  parts by weight of calcium carbonate to  parts by weight of sulfur and most preferably the two are used in approximately the same amounta smaller amount of calcium carbonate causes a shortage of calcium carbonate necessary for the neutralization reaction while a larger amount causes a shortage of the ability to act as a binder of sulfur and makes it difficult to obtain a stable and strong solidfor incorporation of a microporous substance  parts by weight of sulfur  parts by weight of calcium carbonate and  parts by weight of a microporous substance are mixed the sulfur is melted to form a homogeneous dispersion and the dispersion is solidified by rapid coolingafter solidification by rapid cooling the solid is crushed to masses or granules or further processed to molded forms crushing renews the surface and exposes faces other than the sulfur layer with the resultant increase in performance as denitrifying materialthe solid obtained by this invention can be crushed or granulated in the usual manner and a special granulating step such as pressing is not required moreover when the solid obtained by this invention is so crushed as to conform to the target particle diameter the whole surface formed by crushing acts effectively to let microorganisms manifest their activity and while not in use is oxidized with difficulty by oxygen in air and exhibits good storage stabilitya denitrfying material of this invention comprises a denitrifying composition of this invention and mineral fibers mineral fibers to be mixed with a denitrifying composition include rock wool glass wool ceramic wool and carbon wool either singly or as a mixture of two kinds or more and inexpensive rook wool is preferable rock wool is readily processed to granular products exhibits excellent water retention has openings suitable for the growth of microorganisms and performs a function of neutralizing even highly acidic effluent because of its basic chemistryrock wool is obtained by melting a variety of metallurgical slags such as blast furnace slag and electric furnace slag natural rocks such as basalt and diabase or a mixture of the foregoing in an electric furnace or a cupola and converting the melt to fibers by application of centrifugal force andor pressurized gas rock wool is mainly composed of cao sio and alo and additionally contains mgo feo and the like granular rock wool is obtained by processing rock wool by a granulator and it is useful when its particle diameter is  mm preferably  mm also useful is a material obtained by molding a mixture of rock wool and a resin binder into a board followed by cutting or crushing or a material obtained by solidifying a mixture of granular rock wool and an inorganic hydraulic binderrock wool of this type can be mixed as it is with a denitrifying composition or if necessary after preparation of particles of uniform size by such operation as classificationmixing of a denitrifying composition and mineral fibers can be carried out by preparing the two in the desired shape and size by such means as crushing and then blending the two in a known mixer such as drum tumbler and ribbon blender the mixing ratio of the two is  parts by weight of the denitrifying composition and  parts by weight or more preferably  parts by weight of the mineral fibers a smaller amount of mineral fibers leads to a lower ability of the denitrifying composition to retain water and the portion of the denitrifying composition protruding from the surface of the water during a dearth of water becomes drymixing of mineral fibers in this manner allows a denitrifying material to maintain its ability to retain water even during a dearth of water that is water is sucked up from the mineral fibers in water to those above the surface of the water by capillary action and a denitrifying material containing a denitrifying composition and protruding above the surface of the water does not dry even during a dearth of water and sulfuroxidizing bacteria do not perish effluent sucked up into the denitrifying material above the surface of the water is also denitrifiedrock wool is rich in mineral ingredients such as mn zn cu mo fe and b and they elute and produce an effect to activate sulfuroxidizing bacteria moreover a large volume of openings present in mineral fibers is suitable for the growth of other microorganisms such as ammoniaassimilating bacteria and protozoa that decompose organic mattersa denitrifying composition obtained in this manner and a denitrifying material containing the composition are suitable for purifying water relating to nitrate nitrogen while removing nitrate nitrogen of high concentration and preventing the ph of treated water from becoming strongly acidicthe reason for this beneficial effect of a denitrifying composition of this invention is the coexistence of calcium carbonate and sulfur in the same particle furthermore the additional coexistence of a microporous substance simultaneously provides micropores for a carrier or a dwelling of sulfuroxidizing bacteria or for a place of colonization and growth of bacteria calcium carbonate and sulfur acting as nutrients make it unnecessary to supply from outside sulfur that is a source of nutrient and carbon that is necessary for the synthesis of bacteria and the active region of sulfuroxidizing bacteria is nearly neutral in ph where a high microbial activity is maintained with a composition such as this the ph is measured nearly neutral and ions are in good balancehence the denitrifying ability improves markedly and contributes a great deal to improvement of water quality for example nitrate nitrogen present even at high concentration exceeding  ppm in stagnant water can surely be removedthe aforementioned situation is explained with reference to fig  wherein calcium carbonate caco is dispersed in sulfur s a microporous substance is also present dispersed in sulfur s sulfuroxidizing bacteria dwell not only near the surface of the denitrifying composition but also inside the microporous substance and their principal active region is near the surface of the denitrifying composition this active region which is in contact with the water to be treated is nearly neutralin contrast in accordance with the method for mixing individual particles of calcium carbonate and sulfur as shown in fig  the ph of the treated water is seemingly neutral and the resulting balance of ions is seemingly good but the region near the surface of a sulfur s particle which is the active region of sulfuroxidizing bacteria becomes acidic and the microbial activity diminishes also the region near the surface of a calcium carbonate caco particle becomes alkalinea denitrifying composition of this invention can stably perform denitrification at all flow velocities excepting the limiting flow velocity moreover calcium carbonate in coexistence is in an amount sufficiently reactive to neutralize the produced sulfuric acid and the system does not turn alkaline nor acidic and affects the water area insignificantly furthermore negatively charged microorganisms can be retained as a result of adsorption of ammoniacal nitrogen by addition of a substance possessing an ion exchange capacity and adsorption of calcium ions effected separately it is also possible to let phosphoric acid adhere to a part of calcium carbonate and let plants utilize such adhering phosphoric acidfor example with the use of a denitrifying composition of this invention it is possible to promote purification of water by applying a yellow iris with a denitrifying composition of this invention used as culture mediuma denitrifying composition and a denitrifying material of this invention can be used for treating effluent containing nitrate nitrogen for example treating factory effluent city sewage and agricultural effluent such as effluent of underdrains in farms the composition or the material may be used in a variety of manners for example it is placed in a cage or a net and immersed in effluent a column is packed with it and effluent is passed through the packed column or it is dispersed in a tank and brought into contact with effluent however it is advantageous to immerse it in the channels for effluent of underdrains and use it over a long period of time continuous use for several years is feasible if the target is effluent of relatively low concentration of nitrate nitrogen such as agricultural effluent brief description of the drawingsfig  is a schematic illustration of the surface

raw water and the test was continued for another  days the removal of nitrogen after a total of  days was  example a denitrifying material was prepared as in example  except adding  parts by weight of carbon derived from rice hull and the denitrification test was carried out as in example  the removal of nitrogen was  after  days and it was also  after  days from the time of increasing the amount of the raw water or after a total of  daysas is apparent from the aforementioned examples where a denitrifying material was prepared by mixing a denitrifying composition with granular rock wool the denitrifying acitivity of sulfuroxidizing bacteria does not diminish even when the material in part protrudes above the surface of the raw water and the degree of denitrification as a whole can be prevented from dropping industrial applicabilitya denitrifying composition of this invention for microbially removing nitrate nitrogen performs excellently with a high degree of removal of nitrate nitrogen because of the coexistence therein of calcium carbonate and sulfur the composition excludes the need to supply essential nutrients for the microorganisms maintains a good balance in the system before and after the reaction and can be used directly as substrate for cultivation of the microorganisms moreover since calcium carbonate coexists in an amount sufficiently reactive to neutralize sulfuric acid being formed the composition turns neither alkaline nor acidic influences the water area insignificantly and can be applied to treating effluent containing a variety of nitrate nitrogena denitrifying composition of this invention which contains a substance mainly consisting of calcium carbonate and sulfur as main components and a microporous substance as a coexisting component performs excellently in removing nitrate nitrogen present in high concentration in effluent of underdrains in heavily manuring farms the growth of bacteria occurs smoothly as sulfur that is nutrient for sulfuroxidizing bacteria is oxidized as needed by the bacteria and carbon that is necessary for the synthesis of bacteria coexist and at the same time the removal of nitrogen proceeds efficiently as micropores provide places for colonization of bacteria moreover the ph is well balanced and maintained at  in the systemwith the use of a denitrifying composition of this invention water is retained during a dearth of water the substrate for removing nitrate nitrogen protruding above the surface of the water does not dry and sulfuroxidizing bacteria do not perish furthermore the mineral components in mineral fibers are effective for activating sulfuroxidizing bacteriaa process of this invention for producing the aforementioned denitrifying composition can be practiced
