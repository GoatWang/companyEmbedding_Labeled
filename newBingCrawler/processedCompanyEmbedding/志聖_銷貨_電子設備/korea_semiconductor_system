summary study objectives and process rising from obscurity  years ago korean electronics companies have come to own a significant share of the world electronics market today they are now the major dram suppliers in the world they conduct stateoftheart rd projects establish foreign ventures and support worldclass university science and technology st programs the purpose of this study was to provide a clear englishlanguage analysis of how korean corporations operate and what technologies manufacturing procedures capabilities and infrastructure have made them so successful this information coupled with understanding of the future direction of the korean electronics industry is vital to us competitiveness to help us businesses determine in which market sectors to compete and in which areas subcontracting outsourcing and partnership agreements would be beneficial the study was sponsored by the national science foundation through the world technology evaluation center wtec at loyola college in baltimore maryland and the calce electronic packaging research center at the university of maryland the full report of the study the korean electronics industrypecht et al  see also httpwwwcalceumdedu is based on the wtec teams visits in early summer  to korean electronics companies institutions and government agencies on conversations with company employees and on research of the available literature all korean hosts were given an opportunity to review and make corrections to the report prior to publication principal findings koreas electronics capabilities in the past  years have undergone remarkably consistent and rapid expansion in terms of  size and capacity of facilities  technological expertise and sophistication and  income earned and impact on the world market korea has built and is continuing to build a standalone capability in a broad range of electronics technologies including dram sram and asic design approaches electronics materials and packaging and development of key new information technology products eg displays the nations strategic focus is on achieving dominance not only in production and manufacture of electronics products and components but also in creation and innovation of new technologies in the field korea is determined to remain internationally competitive in electronics in the long run and is prepared to commit the required longterm financial and logistical resources to achieve its goals korean manufacturers dominate markets for drams and other such commodity devices the growth of the korean semiconductor industry has been stunning within a year period korean chaebols industrial conglomerates went from being virtual nonplayers to capturing onequarter of the world semiconductor market in  samsung is now the worlds largest dram manufacturer korean players in semiconductor markets are regarded by us and japanese counterparts as formidable competitors government support of electronics includes substantial tax benefits for rd and product testing plant improvement or facility construction and manpower development support has also included considerable direct funding of projects in line with national priorities government support is now turning to new priorities such as information technologies and startup of a domestic semiconductor equipment industry the government and chaebols have worked both independently and in concert to obtain foreign technology from industrialized nations through direct and indirect methods however their ultimate goal is for the country to transition from investmentdriven development to innovationdriven development in which the countrys major competitive advantage will be innovation capability this drive permeates the industry in striving to emulate the electronics expertise of japan and the united states koreans are zealously improving their educational infrastructure and domestic rd facilities solid public support for science and education carefully nurtured by government industry media and the educational establishment has provided a strong foundation for technological infrastructure development educators are focused on developing new creative independent and cooperative thinking skills within the population that will support national selfreliance in hightechnology they are also upgrading the quality of training for technicians and engineers and making rd contributions koreas willingness to invest heavily and longterm in rd plants and manpower is impressive some investment is catchup but as samsungs early prototyping of the  gbit dram and lgs development of its mpeg chip show this investment is increasingly contributing to leadingedge industry breakthroughs koreas rapid industrialization and its success in electronics manufacturing have been driven in part by capitalizing on human resources koreans exhibit high levels of motivation discipline loyalty pride and very hard work at all levels also important are mutuality of employeremployee relationships and a view of the workplace as an extended family and consistency and long range of vision at managerial levels korean electronics investments are global in scope koreas  rd centers in the united states most focused on electronicsrelated research especially semiconductor research make korea the thlargest foreign investor in such us facilities korea is building fabs in in the united states and europe as well as in countries with low labor costs the economic dominance of the huge chaebol conglomerates continues to restrict the viability of innovative small and mediumsized enterprises despite government programs to nurture smaller enterprises role of the government the korean government has placed a high priority on developing the countrys indigenous technological capabilities and creating a worldclass industrial infrastructure by the year  it has maintained an emphatically proactive position with respect to internal development of advanced technology that has been especially beneficial to the domestic semiconductor industry government nurtures the electronics industry in korea in at least four ways it provides a legislative basis for growth of hightechnology industry through means such as national banking regulations lowinterest loans tax incentives and dutyfree import of selected capital goods   it promotes education and rd for hightech industry by providing direct financial support to public and nonprofit institutes universities and other educational institutions primarily through the ministry of science and technology most the ministry of trade industry and energy motie and the ministry of information and communication moic such support often involves partnering with both established and emerging firms in costsharing new product or technology development   it funds infrastructure development including highways and transportation systems rapid dissemination of internettype services etc and through construction of science parks the most prominent of these is taedok twenty miles outside seoul infrastructure development still lags manufacturing growth however   it uses its authority and leadership in cooperation with industry the educational establishment and the media to promote development of a sophisticated technoculture in korea in this decade the government has taken steps to encourage establishment and growth of small to mediumsized companies including setting up institutes such as the korea electronics technology institute keti to assist small and emerging hightech industries in product development augmenting their tool bases and providing other specialized services to help them get started despite these measures the governments emphasis appears to still be on more mainstream siliconbased technologies this is in line with the development plans of the large chaebols which are pressing to move out from the dram market into the asic and display fields all pertinent activities of the korean government are organized around a general outline for technological development that recognizes major domestic as well as global market trends resulting from the socalled g joint government and industry study this study combined internal discussions of korean industry trends with the roadmaps of extranational agencies such as the us sia semiconductor development roadmap the governments highly advanced national han program was a product of the g survey over its tenyear life  through  this program will spend  billion on broadranging rd programs focused on strategic technologies and linking many disciplines and technologies together for synergistic advancement in the electronics area it coordinates ulsirelated projects and assists in the development of broadband integrated services digital networks bisdn highdefinition television hdtv and advanced manufacturing systems at the time of the wtec visit the government was planning investment of some  million for high definition television rd starting in  the han program began branching into such areas as advanced materials microelectromechanical systems mems and flatpanel displays the dram project started in the early s but now part of the han program is an example of direct government support for the electronics industry in such projects as this  costsharing has been expected revenues from licensing technology derived from this research go back to the ministries for reinvestment current industry sentiment in korea seems to run against government support for the dram project while the governments support is relatively constant industry costsharing is declining about  as projected from  this is a result of a perceived maturation of the industry and the fact that semiconductor research is so highly competitive that companies are reluctant to accede to the reporting requirements or the externally supplied schedules and milestones of the government program on the other hand industry appears to welcome some degree of government support in semiconductor and other electronics equipment development korea has little indigenous equipment supplier base although the nucleus of one exists  lg has robotics and control business units and koreas packaging assembly industry makes wafer handlers and positioners lithography tools vacuum deposition equipment and cvd reactors must all be brought in from abroad creating at least a perception of vulnerability and giving korean corporations a minimal role in defining designrule evolution in the area of displays the government apparently has a rather large funding and regulatory role due at least in part to the request in about  from the major electronics firms for government assistance their request led to establishment of edirak the electronic display industrial research association of korea motie funds about  of ediraks budget distributed as loans and matching funds edirak distributed about  million in  about  of that to small companies overall government funding of display projects is difficult for outside observers to tabulate complicated by the fact that various ministries have overlapping interests in some specific projects it appears however that government direct funding and tax breaks for display development will total over  million this decade while individual programs and projects identified and sponsored by the legislature and the ministries may be criticized by some their ultimate value is undeniable the government programs lower the cost of basic research and plant modernization and government funding of university and other educational programs improves the availability of skilled technologists and serves to maintain a pool of basic researchers and educators who serve as consultants to industry at large government planning and coordination reduces redundancy of effort and contributes to synchronized development in many related areas finally the government has made great strides in creating and promoting development of a nationwide science culture and a strong technological infrastructure within its society role of the chaebols koreas economy including its electronics industry is dominated by the relatively small number of singlefamilydominated industrial chaebols that often enjoy vertical monopolies ie the company and its subsidiaries control most of the steps in production from the acquisition of the raw materials to fabrication chaebols also extend horizontally across diverse industries similar to the japanese keiretsu in the immediate postkorean war years the chaebols took advantage of subsidized loans and tax breaks provided by the korean government that allowed them to grow very quickly by the early s the four most prominent chaebols samsung lg hyundai and daewoo were immense and were thriving in essence the story of the remarkable growth of koreas economy is the story of the growth of its chaebols their success and the success of koreas industrialization and modernization are inseparable the chaebols have based much of their success on foreign trade and exports continue to be essential to the stability and growth of the korean economy in  korea was the worlds th largest trading nation with  billion in exports and  billion in imports electronics goods have been among the chaebols most profitable exports korea expects to have steady export growth of  in industrial electronics  in electronic parts and  in consumer electronics kim  table  shows the rising level of total electronics exports of koreas leading firms table  shows total sales comparison of the two tables indicates the importance of exports to the chaebols successes table  value of exports by major electronics companies  table  total sales of major electronics companies  semiconductors have been especially important to koreas export earnings a total of  billion worth of semiconductors was exported in  of which  billion was attributable to samsung alone korean semiconductor companies have made significant strides in capturing global semiconductor market share in the past ten years at the time this report was written samsung had become the worlds highestvolume dram supplier and hyundai and lg were in second and sixth places respectively together they made up almost  of the revenues earned by the top  dram producers in the world a major factor in this considerable success is that korean manufacturers successfully implemented more efficient mass production techniques allowing more competitive unit pricing in  forecasts for korean semiconductor exports were revised downward several times due to a global market glut and plummeting prices for  mbit drams in response the industry pushed ahead with early transition to  mbit drams and highervalueadded memory chips korean companies have progressed to the point where they are able to develop products specifically for individual market requirements they have been very successful in europe despite specifications that vary considerably from country to country samsungs european sales increased from  million to over  billion from  to  it has experienced exceptionally high growth in the european market in recent years compared to european us and japanese firms as pressure has increased for manufacturers to develop more heavily integrated circuits in the sub µm range korean companies have have started to address the problem of indigenous manufacturing technology much of the equipment relevant to microelectronics manufacturing such as sputterers ion implanters and diffusion furnaces are supplied by foreign equipment manufacturers according to the korean semiconductor industry association ksia domestic chip makers in  relied on foreign manufacturers for  of equipment and  of materials to counteract this dependence on foreign equipment and materials suppliers the government has encouraged korean companies to develop indigenous semiconductor manufacturing equipment through tax incentives and lowinterest loans for rd contributions of corporate culture to economic success nationalism plays a key role in koreas culture among professionals and workers alike there is a common resolve for korea to become an economic giant in the world market business groups also appear to be like enormous families where the growth of the whole group is targeted but is accomplished through interdependent growth of smaller units at successively lower levels to a very great extent companies enjoy loyalty from employees and companies return that loyalty besides patriotism and mutual managementemployee loyalty and teamwork other standout characteristics of korean corporate culture include highly focused and extremely hard work manufacturing excellence investment of a high percentage  or more of revenues into rd and aggressive globalization acquiring technology from abroad vs building domestic capabilities a good deal of the technology crucial to the success of korean electronics firms historically has been transferred from other countries primarily the united states and japan aiming for ultimate selfreliance in technology innovation a key korean business strategy for remaining competitive in the global electronics market is to engage in joint ventures benefits include maintaining the flow of technology with leading foreign companies distributing rd costs mitigating the effects of rising domestic labor costs securing more favorable trade agreements and contributing to advancement of the human community korean government educational organizations and private companies all have collaborations with overseas universities goals for these collaborations include training korean engineers and advancing new technological frontiers another method espoused by korean government and industry to speed up technology transfer and increase technology selfreliance is recruitment of foreign nationals and overseas koreans with knowledge and experience in hightechnology fields korea has been actively recruiting useducated koreans or persons of korean descent and other foreign engineers to fill technology gaps korean companies continue to pay large royalties for foreign technology royalty payments from january  through february  reached almost  billion electric and electronics companies made the largest share of the payments samsungs payments far exceeded those of other companies an important aspect of the growth of koreas electronics industry has been its use of original equipment manufacture oem agreements which have allowed korean companies to sell products under other companies names to compensate for their own brands lack of name recognition korean companies now observe that to lead the global electronics market with products bearing their own names they must reduce exporting through oem agreements most of them are striving to become independent of oem agreements by increasing their prestige through innovations in design and technology role of the universities koreas national commitment to education is shared by government corporations and the population at large the literacy rate is  a high percentage of high school graduates enter universities and roughly  of college graduates obtain advanced degrees it is an absolute national priority to educate the population at all levels especially in math and sciences the korean university system is a source of great national pride both public and private industry universities offer strong programs in support of electronics as in industry nationalism and a drive to excel in st is evident in the university culture in korea government support for science and technology education the ministry of education administers public universities but most separately contributes funds to university science and technology programs  both public and private  through the korean science and engineering foundation kosef koreas equivalent of the us national science foundation kosef has established approximately  university st centers of excellence which it funds annually at the milliondollar level these centers are required to collaborate with at least three other institutions and are strongly encouraged to attract supplemental support from industry swinbanks  centers with the best reputations include the korean advanced institute of science and technology kaist and seoul national university snu kaist is the only national university administered under the auspices of most which has allowed it to skirt some government employment rules for example it offers triple the salary of other public universities to recruit the best professors worldwide its curriculum emphasizes research in applied fields defined by most as national priorities swinbanks  historically snu has been the premier korean university it continues to attract the best student population and it boasts one of the most prestigious faculties in the country special facilities and training in electronicsrelated disciplines offered by these institutions include kaists material surface engineering center snus research center for thin film fabrication and crystal growing of advanced materials and snus firstrate facility for teaching semiconductor processing this latter facility is a inch fab that can run a full cmos line with  micron design rules with equipment comparable to that of uc berkeley mit or stanford the facility has an ebeam directwrite lithography system that routinely processes runs of multiple project chips with designs from other universities of the  colleges and universities in korea approximately  have electrical engineering departments  of those are active in the integrated circuit design center idec at least  of the institutions active in idec are well regarded by the korean semiconductor industry for their teaching of ic design industrial support for st education korean industry takes the position that a welleducated workforce is critical to competitiveness corporations generally sponsor research of considerable educational value even if the practical applicability may not be immediately apparent industry leaders do not believe that research of individual university professors working with small groups of graduate students can lead to commercially important innovations nonetheless they do strongly believe that university research produces wellqualified graduates and therefore wellqualified employees  that is highly skilled and innovative engineers approximately half of the research money in the most highly regarded electronics programs such as those of kaist and snu comes from industry the universities then engage in the balancing act of trying to accommodate the research needs of professors while trying to train students that meet the needs of industry company executives develop close relationships with individual professors in order to have confidence in their abilities to attract and train top students that the companies will ultimately employ as a consequence professors often have a great deal of clout within the industry as the success and profitability of large korean companies have increased several have started their own educational institutions some of which are fullfledged universities that offer degrees up to the phd level the most highly regarded industrial universities include daewoos institute of advanced engineering iae samsung advanced institute of technology sait and pohang institute of science and technology postech owned and operated by the pohang steel company in less than a decade since postech opened its doors it has come to attract the top  of the nations college students pettit  like other industry schools postech pays competitive salaries to its faculty much higher than those offered at governmentrun schools and even more than at kaist there appear to be at least three factors contributing to the trend of companies founding universities dissatisfaction with the political climate within public korean universities desire to better guide training and recruitment of a skilled workforce and the philosophy of diversifying whenever and wherever possible an unstated goal of companyowned schools appears to be to build loyalty with top engineering students at the same time as training them so that they will come back and work for the company private industrys universities are completely independent of government agencies funded solely by the parent companies availability of cleanroom facilities at korean institutions of higher learning programs like idec and the excellent teaching programs at kaist snu postech and other fine technical universities puts korea on a par with the united states for educational resources to support the semiconductor industry electrical engineering students emerge from korean programs with strong skills in solid state device processing design and layout while industry emphasizes support for applied research at universities this does not suggest a weakness in basic science through kosef the government primarily supports basic research perceived weaknesses in university st education to wtec panelists there seems to be a surprising degree of selfcriticism within the university community considering the excellence of the facilities and the training offered an overwhelming proportion  of faculty at the more prestigious korean universities are educated in the united states a number of them express concern that their graduates are unprepared for the demands on creativity required to make new designs and more competitive products anticipating that the future does not remain with dram but with sophisticated and advanced circuit design many ustrained faculty members in korea appear to be committed to teaching global awareness and creative independent thinking skills as well as those technical skills their students will need they acknowledge that future competitiveness will require combining all fields related to electronics manufacture layout architecture systems fabrication analog and others and that it will take imaginative and resourceful minds and team efforts to achieve interdisciplinary solutions they also realize that they have a difficult job to overcome cultural hurdles in order to nurture a more creative workforce for the future the ministry of education also realizes this and has begun implementing changes to foster creative and independent thinking skills at the secondary and university levels the korean semiconductor industry memory technology dominates the korean electronics industry a very high percentage of koreas memory sales are overseas making the industrys revenues highly sensitive to the global market requiring korea to excel in the technologies that shape market trends korean electronics manufacturers are moving into higherperformance highervalueadded markets there is a shortage of engineering and research professionals in the korean industry among other efforts to build proficiency in advanced technologies korean firms are partnering with us and japanese manufacturers to build stateoftheart facilities in korea examples include anams sept   billion contract with ti to build nonmemory semiconductors involving tis transfer to anam of  µm processing technology cmos technology and future joint plans to commercialize  µm  µm and  µm processing technologies dram industry successesstrengths include the following world leadership in dram production  in  samsung was  hyundai  and lg    ability by all major firms to produce highspeed highly integrated as  mbit memory packages   several leadingedge technology developments including samsungs announcement in dec  of its  gbit dram ahead of all competition and lgs mpeg chip   combined processing capacity for  µm inch wafers by samsung hyundai and lg in excess of mo   worldclass training facilities at universitiesrd institutes including  ic prototyping centers and chaebols serving as foundries for fabricating chips designed by rd center researcherstrainees dram industry rdplanned improvements include the following design for faster speeds larger capacities lower power dissipation higher integration and wider io architectures   work on rdram sdram cdram to bring memory speed closer to microprocessor speed   enhance transistor and capacitor fabrication technologies to effect size reductions and design chips to operate at lower voltages to ensure transistor and capacitor stability as they become smaller   customize drams for telecom and video equipment sram industry successesstrengths include the following samsung was the worlds thlargest sram manufacturer in  with sales of  million   ability of korean firms to produce highly integrated products   a strong focus on sram because it is considered more ideal than dram for applications requiring lower power dissipation and increased speed since it doesnt require periodic refreshment   a steady and ongoing improvement in basic rd on the other hand korean companies lag market leaders by six months to one year in producing bicmos highspeed cmos highpincount and specialfunction srams sram industry rdplanned improvements include the following goals closely parallel to the main goals for dram   use of bicmos to shorten access time to  ns or less   use of heavily integrated architecture and pseudostatic dram technology to increase capacity   use of leadonchip architecture to reduce chip size and increase capacity   development of wider ios to supplant the x io standard   movement from resistancetype to tfttype structures to reduce voltage requirements korean industry is putting a premium on becoming a major player in flash memory expecting it to be a key market after  especially for portable computers the perceived advantages are  its low power consumption and high capacities because smaller cells do not require separate capacitors  it requires a relatively small facility investment and  it allows for highly integrated lowcost mass production development efforts in this area focus on nandtype flash memories the korean memory industry appears interested in ferroelectric random access memory because it is nonvolatile like flash memory but allows the freer bitaccess and bitrewriting capabilities of a ram the technology does have major difficulties which make some in the global industry skeptical however many in the korean industry believe these problems can eventually be overcome to give fram a significant market share in the next  years samsung is one of the worlds top producers of mask rom at fourth place in  mask rom should continue to be a central member of koreas memory market and a constituent of consumer applications such as game machines karaoke machines and electronic note pads and dictionaries in the future it is expected to compete with highdensity products like cdroms in such applications as fax machines and printers korean firms are competitive in the production of highcapacity and even specialfunction mask rom memory modules korean firms lag the market by about half a year in the production of highpincount products applications for other memory technologies are relatively minor and are concentrated in digital signal processing telecommunications large systems etc they include lowpower vlsi circuits cdma modem chip sets asics cmos and compound semiconductor devices in the area of process technology rd work is still focused on improving photolithography and plasma etching for mass production work is underway on xray and other new lithographic techniques for nextgeneration massively integrated circuits materials work is focused on new materials to improve homogeneity of wafer surfaces cvd is being developed to replace sputter method for al wiring importance is placed on new packaging technology like lead on chip d packages and chipsized packages especially for very thin packaging for memory cards for portable electronic equipment the korean display industry the korean display industry is only a decade old built through a concerted ongoing industrygovernment effort based on the perception that korean strength in electronics and information markets increasingly requires strength in display technologies overall koreas display industry is strong in conventional technology and weak in new technology but it has successfully entered the marketplace government funding of display rd has been considerable through various han projects and  government funding of edirak at the time of the wtec visit the government was supporting about  display development projects with emphasis on manufacturing technology for information displays ten of the projects were for flat panel displays based on wtec interviews it appears that fpd funding was in the neighborhood of  million in the first half of the s and  were for wide crts motie is investing some  million in display development as both direct funding and tax exemptions from  and other ministries have complementary programs some display development projects and some government diplomatic efforts involve participation from or technical cooperation with foreign entities including the us department of defense korean display
