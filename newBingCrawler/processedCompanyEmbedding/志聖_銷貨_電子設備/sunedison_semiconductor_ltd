centskwh in   reduction in cost of wind energy wind power change is in the air thanks to significant declines in the cost of wind energy recent advances in design mean that today’s wind turbines are converting a higher amount of wind into wind energy and that has reduced the cost of wind energy by an impressive  percent since    this has led to significant growth in wind capacity across america and the world for example fully onequarter of all new electricgenerating capacity added in the us in  came from wind power bringing the nation’s total installed wind capacity to almost  gw that’s enough energy to power over  million homes   at sunedison we’re doing our part to lead this important shift to clean affordable renewable energy not just in the us but also around the world the world of energy is on the cusp of major change people everywhere are seeking an alternative to conventional fossil fuels our commitment to solar and wind energy means we are ready to meet those changing needs whichever way the wind blows us department of energy august  wind technologies market report highlight share go big and stay home wind power in the sprawling deserts of utah you will find the state’s largest wind farm sunedison’s milford wind project generates a staggering  mw of clean power since its completion in  this facility has generated close to  million megawatt hours of clean renewable electricity to produce the same amount of energy a coalfired plant would have had to burn  million tons of coal   pictured here is sunedison project manager bill dent who is about to scale the inside of one of the foottall turbines there are  of them onsite that’s why bill and his team of almost  fulltime employees have made milford and the surrounding area their home that way with the help of sunedison’s remote operations centers they can monitor and maintain the facility  hours a day all year round   because when you build something big enough to supply energy for  homes right in your own backyard you want to make sure it keeps working just the way it was designed to share old ideas new technology wind power for thousands of years human ingenuity has created technologies to harness the power of the wind but to meet the growing energy needs of a rapidly expanding global population traditional methods need a little boost from modern technology   at sunedison we’re committed to bringing the latest technology to the world of renewable energy that’s why our wind farms utilize the most advanced turbines capable of transforming even a light breeze into clean electricity   the old windmill pictured here stands only a little ways away from one of our wind farms the  mw project near milford utah and it serves as a reminder that sometimes the simplest ideas

mw utilityscale solar project built by sunedison sits in the sprawling sundrenched avra valley northwest of tucson arizona it generates enough clean energy to power  homes and will do so for decades to come and each year that it operates it will save approximately  million gallons of water that would otherwise have been needed for fossil fuel generated electricity in addition the co reductions achieved by the avra valley project are equivalent to taking over  cars off the road   this is only one of dozens of utility scale projects sunedison has built or operates around the world which together generate over  gigawatts of energy share  years of community spirit solar solutions in the early s when the pilgrims settled the town of bourne massachusetts they were looking to create a community of likeminded individuals today that spirit of community is alive and well its latest expression can be found in the town’s innovative “community solar” project part of a growing trend toward shared renewable energy   rather than installing individual solar systems on homes and businesses a larger system is built people in the community can own or lease a portion of the system similar to a community garden where individuals work a plot of land in a larger garden not only are larger systems highly cost effective community solar enables those who might not otherwise be able to enjoy the benefits of solar to do so – for example apartment dwellers renters or people whose homes don’t get enough sunlight   sunedison is proud to have partnered with the residents of bourne to develop this pioneering approach to solar energy and to do so in the same spirit of community that the pilgrims would have recognized share  million in utility bill savings solar solutions affordable housing demands affordable energy that’s why  public housing authorities across massachusetts have partnered with sunedison to purchase solar energy solutions that will deliver an estimated  million in savings over the next  years   but the benefits are not just economic co emissions will be reduced by  million tons  that’s equivalent to taking some  cars off the road   all of which means the citizens of massachusetts can breathe a whole lot easier knowing that public housing energy costs will be stable and predictable for decades to come thanks to clean and reliable solar energy share

technology solar energy is at a tipping point it’s well on its way to becoming the lowest cost energy solution—not just in comparison to other renewables but the cost winner over fossil fuels as well   at sunedison we’re working to bring about this change by developing leading edge technology that will produce the lowest cost polysilicon in the world polysilicon is the basic building block of solar cells and with this stepchange in technology we’re well on the way to producing a  watt solar panel at a cost of  per watt   our proprietary technology now in operation at our joint venture facility in ulsan korea produces ultra pure polysilicon  times more efficiently than conventional technologies using  less energy lowcost clean solar energy will transform the way all of us use energy and it has the power to transform our planet as well share when catching the wind bigger is better transformative technology wind turbine technology is climbing to new heights—quite literally the average power output of newly installed wind turbines in the us has risen  in the past  years   this increased power output has been achieved in part by building up the average hub height of new turbines has grown by almost  now reaching over  feet at the same time the average rotor diameter has more than doubled add it all up and wind turbine blades are reaching higher than ever before   and if you’ve ever climbed to the top of a tall peak you’ll know the winds get stronger the higher you go  for wind turbines this means the taller they are the more wind there is to capture and transform

future of energy “net zero” refers to homes that generate as much energy as they consume and the energy they generate typically comes from clean solar power that means the amount of energy they need to draw from conventional sources is exactly zero   sunedison’s patented hybrid solar system has allowed users to transform their homes into selfsufficient net zero buildings our system not only generates electricity but also provides solar water heating solar home heating and solar home cooling – all under one roof   this is only one of many innovative systems we’re developing to take advantage of the virtually infinite power of the sun in the future more and more homes will be net zero freeing homeowners from their dependence on centralized power and from the uncertainties of energy pricing share the future is now the future of energy the world of solar energy has reached a remarkable moment of transformation thanks to three converging trends first costs have plummeted and we can confidently predict they will fall even further in the future we believe that solar will soon become the most cost effective way to produce electricity in fact in some parts of the world it already is   secondly the performance of solar panels has risen dramatically – up by  in just the last  years and finally the ability to store the energy produced by solar systems is improving every day thanks to innovations driven by the automotive industry and electric cars   taken together these changes mean that soon more of us will be using the abundant power of the sun to run our homes and our cars it gives a whole new meaning to the idea that the world revolves around the sun share growing together the future of energy solar energy is rapidly growing to satisfy more and more of our energy needs and as the industry grows so is the demand for skilled workers that’s why sunedison and grid alternatives have launched a us based initiative called rise to train new workers and ensure a more inclusive workforce   this initiative provides training for women and those in underserved communities but the benefits don’t stop there in addition to providing handson training this program also makes solar accessible to lowincome families allowing them to lower their energy costs   as our industry grows our hope is that everyone will rise with it especially those who need a little extra help share from  to  megawatts in  months the future of energy as the demand for solar energy grows so does the need for rapid deployment at sunedison we take special pride in being able to bring largescale solar projects online quickly and efficiently   consider our amanecer solar cap plant located in the atacama desert in chile this sprawling project consists of  solar photovoltaic “pv” panels spread over  acres and generates  mw of power it took less than  months to build by way of comparison the average coalfired plant would take  years or more to construct   as the pace at which
