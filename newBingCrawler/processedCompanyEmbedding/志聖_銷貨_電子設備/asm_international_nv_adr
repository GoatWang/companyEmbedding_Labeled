international nv adr asmi these semiconductor equipment companies deserve your attention published on august   at  am by the motley fool in news page  of next gtgtsee all in the highly cyclical semiconductor business only a few companies possess the necessary strength to survive and succeed through the constant ups and downs although many analysts would support the idea of investing in sector behemoths like applied materials inc nasdaqamat in other words playing safe i would advocate on taking a closer look at some smaller lessknown companies like asm international nv adr nasdaqasmi and klatencor corporation nasdaqklac which hold strong competitive advantages mainly due to their cuttingedge and specific product offerings and thus stand as highly compelling investment opportunities the jewel of the crown asm international nv adr nasdaqasmi is a leading provider of manufacturing process and technology solutions for semiconductor producers carrying out frontandbackend activities after selling out a  stake of its backend activities and distributing the gains among shareholders while implementing a restructuring of its frontend segment the company looks like a more appealing even undervalued investment although it reported strong secondquarter results a weak guidance for its thirdquarter revenue led its stock price to plummet by over  opening an attractive entry point for investors strong competition from applied materials inc nasdaqamat is expected to continue but considerable spending on rd should provide the firm with a competitive advantage over the next few years as a result analysts anticipate that asm international nv adr nasdaqasmi will outperform the sector’s eps performance in the long run mainly on the back of its cuttingedge frontend tools business moreover the progressive migration of its frontend manufacturing activities to the lowercost market of singapore should help asm international nv adr nasdaqasmi improve its margins and returns in addition its backend segment with lowcost operations in asia looks like a hidden gem for it remains consistently profitable returning industry leading results trading at a third of the industry average in relation to its sales and about half the mean in relation to its consensus earnings this stock looks quite undervalued moreover a  dividend yield makes the wait worthwhile i´d say buy and hold you will probably not regret it goliath is not so agile applied materials inc nasdaqamat is a leading provider of manufacturing equipment services and software for the semiconductor industry among others including the solar photovoltaic and flat panel display industries with almost ten times the market capitalization of asm international nv adr nasdaqasmi the competition it poses is considerably strong its scale broad product offering and strong brand name provide it with a wide economic moat allowing it to successfully compete in almost every segment of the industry moreover hefty rd investments keep the firm ahead of its competition while continuous costcontrol initiatives and increasing synergies make its prices more appealing however i consider that applied materials inc nasdaqamat is not an investment as attractive as asm international nv adr nasdaqasmi even though analysts expect it to outperform the broader sector in terms of eps growth in the long run for starters the width of its product offering can be seen as a pro but also as a con since many of its competitors specialize in particular products applied materials inc nasdaqamat runs disadvantaged in many of its endmarkets while smaller firms offer the best products in these particular niches furthermore the cyclicality of the semiconductor business a high fixedcost structure and the recent weakness in its solar equipment segment could strongly impact its future results finally its valuation at  times consensus earnings and a peg ratio of  both about double the industry averages lead me to advocate on holding on this stock for now a closer inspection klatencor corporation nasdaqklac is another interesting investment option in the semiconductor equipment business with a market cap of almost  billion it stands in between asm and applied materials inc nasdaqamat however holding a leading spot in the process diagnostic and control pdc market the company offers margins and returns which are among the best in the industry page  of next gtgtsee all related insider monkey articlesapplied materials inc amat klatencor corporation klac cree inc klatencor corporation klac
