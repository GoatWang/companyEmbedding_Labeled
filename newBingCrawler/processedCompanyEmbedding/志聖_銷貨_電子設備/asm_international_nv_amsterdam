frontend gross margins approximately  jobs will be lost in almere almere the netherlands january    asm international nv nasdaq asmi and euronext amsterdam asm today announced that it plans for a major restructuring of asm europe asme this plan involves the transfer from almere the netherlands of the remaining manufacturing and operational procurement activities for the vertical furnace product line to the companys frontend manufacturing operations in singapore fems and a reduction of the asme workforce in almere the implementation will take place over the next  months asmi expects the proposed measures will have a positive impact on the companys frontend gross margins and will lower the operating breakeven level for vertical furnaces by at least  anticipated initial benefits in  in terms of lower vertical furnace costs are expected to be approximately €  million reorganization charges of approximately €  million are expected to be included in the companys accounts mainly in  this includes an estimated €  million in noncash fixed asset impairment charges in making the announcement chuck del prado president and chief executive officer of asm international said lowered capacity utilization at our fems facility  the result of deteriorating global economic and industry conditions today allows us to execute several steps in our april  roadmap to frontend profitability simultaneously and to accelerate our roadmap the measures we are announcing today will lead to a leaner and more focused costcompetitive frontend operation and one that is capable of generating higher gross margins with a structurally lower costbase mr del prado continued losing loyal and dedicated employees is a painful process however we are committed to making tough choices and firmly executing on them in order to deliver improved frontend profitabilitywe will make every effort to ensure that an equitable social plan for those leaving the company will be determined in the framework of all applicable consultation procedures with the asme works council and the trade unions five years ago asmi established fems as its lowcost manufacturing hub for frontend production in singapore the transfer of manufacturing was planned in three stages as detailed in the roadmap to frontend profitability phase  includes the transfer of the manufacturing of generic parts and subassemblies which represent approximately  of the cost of goods sold for all products as of december  asmi has completed phase  for three of its core product groups vertical furnaces epitaxy and pecvd and is beginning the phase  transfer of its transistor products ald components the company is utilizing the current conditions of low production volumes to initiate the next step involving the transfer of vertical furnace final assembly and testing concurrent with the completion of phase  for the remaining product categories the proposed workforce reduction affects approximately  employees in almere the remaining asm europe workforce of approximately  people will concentrate on vertical furnace rd vertical furnace product management and regional sales  service activities for all frontend products mr del prado added asmi will maintain a strong highly skilled technology workforce at almere underscoring our commitment to retaining a strong base in the netherlandsabout asm international asm

changes which this stale and anemic company needs seriously needson other notes there are good medical and dental benefits k match up to  etc etcconsold middle management seriously most all need to go they do not treat their employees very good and there are many many smart people below them who are very good and eventually tire out on trying to get the improvements done the company seriously needs middle management has their little buddy system and they are ineffective and are truly the anchor to how great this company could be that its been damaging asms reputation for years now and it doesnt make it a pleasant place to work nearly everyone i know in my department is looking to leave asm pretends to be  company but the business units do not communicate or work together their block heads and they compete against each other does it make sense for asm korea to be developing their own same process module as asm japan just because their cultures dont like each other they wont work together if i was ceo id put a stop to that garbage instantly advice to managementthe executive level does not get fed the proper information up to them from the middle managers who are collecting fat paychecks and do very little that even the executive level doesnt really know whats going on so they can make proper decisions and its not their fault im sure chuck wouldnt want his company run this way if he really knew what was going on the company consistently gets feedback from customers that our field service is terrible at fixing the tools because nobody holds them accountable to strive and
