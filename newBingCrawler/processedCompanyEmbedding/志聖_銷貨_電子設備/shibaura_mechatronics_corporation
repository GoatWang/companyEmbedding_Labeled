toshiba  press releases  february  toshiba shibaura mechatronics and chlorine engineers together establish new chemicalreuse environmentconscious semiconductor resist stripping technology  february  toshiba corporation shibaura mechatronics corporation chlorine engineers corp ltd practical application of industrys first electrolyzed sulfuric acid method toshiba corporation shibaura mechatronics corporation and chlorine engineers corp ltd today announced codevelopment of an innovative semiconductor resist stripping technology that employs electrolyzed sulfuric acid the technology draws on toshibas cuttingedge semiconductor process technology shibaura mechatronicsexpertise in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and chlorine engineers knowhow in high durability electrolyzer technology for highpurity chemicals it is the first time that electrolyzed sulfuric acid has been applied to resist stripping resist is a masking material used in the lithographic process that forms semiconductor circuits on a chip substrate once circuits are etched the resist must be removed which is typically done with peroxymonosulfuric acid produced by mixing sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide however once the process is completed it is difficult to recycle the sulfuric acid because of dilution by the water released as a byproduct of the breakdown of the hydrogen peroxide in the mixture the new technology allows sulfuric acid to be recycled as electrolyzing sulfuric acid generates peroxymonosulfuric acid without producing water the new technology reduces the volume of sulfuric acid used in resist stripping by  percent and totally eliminates use of hydrogen peroxide as a result it reduces the overall environmental burden of the semiconductor wet process and adds to the efficiency of wastewater treatment the new process is also more efficient and contributes to improved productivity by shortening resist stripping time by  toshiba shibaura mechatronics and chlorine engineers have already developed a singlewafer resiststripping system that will be integrated into the resiststripping process at toshibas yokkaichi operations in april shibaura mechatronics corporation and chlorine engineers corp ltd also plan to market the overall system and an electrolyzed sulfuric acid generation unit that can be integrated into the current resiststripping process the new technology can be applied to overall process of circuit formation on wafers and the companies intend to promote such application outline of development the new technology was developed as a substitute for the current sulfuric acid hydrogen peroxide mixture spm technology applied to the “wet process of resist stripping  codevelopment development combined toshibas cuttingedge semiconductor

technology for direct electrolysis of concentrated sulfuric acid  comparison with current method current method the current spm resiststripping method activated sulfuric acid by mixing it with hydrogen peroxide accelerating the reaction with the resist the chemical reaction formula is as below reuse of sulfuric acid is difficult in the current method as sulfuric acid is diluted by water　 new method the new technology achieves the same reaction and result as spm but uses electrolyzed sulfuric acid this is achieved by exciting the acid as shown below   the new method allows reuse of sulfuric acid as the water is also electrolyzed and does not dilute the sulfuric acid  impact estimate  impact on resiststripping process pattern rework process sulfuric acid use reduced by

as a peripheral end face of a semiconductor wafer background artin the past an inspection system for detecting the roughness of the surface of an object being inspected has been proposed for example see patent document  in this type of inspection system a laser beam is fired at the surface of an object being inspected and the amount of laser beam scattered and reflected at that object surface is measured furthermore information showing the surface roughness of the object surface is generated based on the measured amount according to this inspection system it becomes possible to objectively inspect the surface roughness of a semiconductor wafer etc patent document  japanese patent publication a no  disclosure of the inventionproblems to be solved by the inventionhowever the conventional inspection system inspects a flat surface such as the surface of a semiconductor wafer when inspecting a curved surface such as a peripheral end face of a semiconductor wafer suitable inspection is difficult for example when inspecting the peripheral end face of a semiconductor wafer it is necessary to set the size of the laser spot to at least the thickness of the semiconductor wafer about  µm to  mm but if setting the size of the laser spot in that way due to the effect of the degree of curvature of the peripheral end face it is not possible to suitably receive the laser beam scattered at that peripheral end face therefore unless adjusting the sensitivity of the light receiving element or otherwise suitably changing the measurement conditions suitable data cannot be acquired the present invention was made so as to solve this problem in the prior art and provides a surface roughness inspection system able suitably inspect even a curved surface of an object being inspected ep  discloses a method and apparatus for inspecting surface irregularities of transparent plate a beam of light is irradiated toward a surface of a transparent plate at an angle of  to  degrees or  to  degrees for p or s polarized light and the reflected image is projected onto a screen a camera can pick up the reflected image to obtain density signals for calculating irregularities of the surface of the plate us  discloses a wafer inspection apparatus having a supporting means for rotatably supporting a wafer a circumferential edge imaging means for imaging a circumferential edge of the wafer a notch imaging means for imaging a notch a notch illumination part for illuminating the notch and a control means for processing image data imaged by the circumferential edge and notch imaging means means for solving the problemsa surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention is defined in claim  due to this configuration since the width of a line sensor is extremely small even if the surface of the object being inspected is curved by suitably setting the direction of curvature of the object surface and the orientation of the line sensor it is possible to scan the object surface in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the line sensor extends in the state greatly eliminating the effect of the degree of curvature of the object surface furthermore when that line sensor imaging unit scans the object surface the pixel density value is acquired for each pixel based on the density signal output from the line sensor and density state information expressing the state of density in the scan direction of the object surface is generated based on all of the pixel density values acquired for the object surface the level of the density signal output from the line sensor changes due to the direction of the local surface of the object surface or relief shapes etc so the density state information obtained based on the density signal from such a line sensor can express the state of roughness of the surface of an object being inspected in the scan direction due to this configuration when the line sensor is scanning the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer in the peripheral direction the pixel density value is acquired for each pixel based on the density signal output from the line sensor and density state information showing the state of the density in the scan direction of that peripheral end face is generated based on all of the pixel density values acquired for the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer furthermore that density state information expresses the state of roughness of the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer in the scan direction peripheral direction further the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention can be configured so that the processing unit has a display control means for making a display unit display a profile of density in a scan direction of the object surface based on the density state information due to this configuration the display unit displays a profile of the density in the scan direction of the object surface so the operator can view that profile and judge the roughness in the scan direction of the object surface further the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention can be configured so that the processing unit has a judging means for judging the roughness of the object surface based on the density state information due to this configuration the roughness of the object surface is judged based on the density state information able to show the state of roughness of the surface of the object being inspected in the scan direction of the line sensor so it becomes possible to judge the roughness of the object surface based on the judgment results furthermore the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention can be configured so that the density state generating means has a processing means shifting a one or more scan line window set with respect to image information expressed by all of the pixel density values acquired for the surface of an object being inspected in the scan direction of the object surface and calculating an area density value representing that window based on all of the pixel density values in the window at each scan position and generates the density state information based on the area density value at each scan position due to this configuration density state information is obtained based on the area density value calculated based on all of the pixel density values in the window so by suitably setting the width of the window number of lines it is possible to judge the roughness of the object surface based on the density state information from a greater perspective further the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention can be configured so that the processing means computes the sum of all of the pixel density values in the window as an area density value due to this configuration since the area density value representing the window is obtained by adding up all of the pixel density values in the window it is possible to easily obtain that area density value further the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention can be configured by having a window setting means setting a width of the window in the scan direction due to this configuration it is possible to set various widths of the window so it is possible to judge the roughness of an object surface under various conditions effects of the inventionaccording to the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention it becomes possible to scan the object surface in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the line sensor extends in the state greatly eliminating the effect of the degree of curvature of the object surface density state information able to express the state of roughness in the scan direction of the object surface is generated based on the density signal output from that line sensor so it becomes possible to suitably inspect the surface roughness even if the surface of the object being inspected is a curved surface brief description of the drawings fig  is a view showing the configuration of a surface roughness inspection

turntable ccd camera lens system line sensor light source unit power source processing unit operation unit monitor unit semiconductor wafer peripheral end face best mode for carrying out the inventionbelow embodiments of the present invention will be explained based on the drawings the embodiments of the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention are configured as shown in fig  this surface roughness inspection system inspects the surface roughness of the peripheral end face of a semiconductor wafer in fig  this surface roughness inspection system has a wafer rotary aligner  this wafer rotary aligner  turns a turntable  on which a semiconductor wafer  being inspected is set further a ccd camera  imaging unit is set so as to become a predetermined positional relationship with respect to the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer  set on the turntable  and a light source unit  emitting diffused light by the supply of power from a power source  is set so as to irradiate the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer  falling in the range of capture of the ccd camera  by the diffused light further this surface roughness inspection system has a processing unit  the processing unit  controls the wafer rotary aligner  based on the operation of the operation unit  to make the turntable  turn by a predetermined speed and processes the density signal for each pixel output from the ccd camera  the processing unit  can make a monitor unit  display unit display an image of the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer  and various information based on the density signal of each pixel from the ccd camera  the ccd camera  as shown in figs a and b is provided with a lens system  object lens and a line sensor  single color ccd line sensor the ccd camera  as shown in fig b is set so as to face the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  so that the line sensor  extends along the direction substantially vertical to the surface of the semiconductor wafer  further the ccd camera  is set in orientation as shown in fig a so that the light reflected from the light irradiated portion p of the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer  irradiated by the light from the light source unit  can be effectively received by the line sensor  since the positional relationship between the line sensor  and the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  being inspected is set in the above way see figs a b an extremely fine for example  µm scan line of the line sensor  is set in a direction substantially vertical to the surface of the semiconductor wafer  vertical surface that is perpendicular to the peripheral direction of the peripheral end face  due to this the line sensor  can scan the peripheral end face  in the peripheral direction in the state eliminating the effects of the degree of curvature of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  the processing unit  executes processing according to the routine shown in fig  in fig  the processing unit  controls the wafer rotary aligner  and makes the turntable  turn when a predetermined start operation is performed by the operation unit  along with turning of this turntable  the semiconductor wafer  turns at a predetermined speed and the scan of the peripheral end face  by the ccd camera  of the semiconductor wafer  is started s in the process of scanning that peripheral end face  the processing unit  receives as input the density signal for each pixel successively output from the line sensor  of the ccd camera unit  converts that density signal into pixel density values and stores the same in a predetermined memory s furthermore the processing unit  judges if the semiconductor wafer  has made one turn and the scan for the entire circumference of the end face has ended s and repeatedly executes the processing s when the processing unit  judges that the scan of the entire circumference of the end face of the semiconductor wafer  has ended yes at s it acquires the size of the window designated by the operation of the operation unit  s as shown in fig  a one or more scan line window formed on the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  by the line sensor  can be set that is a one scan line window w two scan line window w three scan line window w   n number scan line window wn etc can be designated note that at the time when the scan of the entire circumference of the end face of the semiconductor wafer  has ended all of the pixel density values obtained over the entire circumference of that end face are loaded in the memory as image information showing the total circumference °position to ° position of the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer  the processing unit  as shown in fig  sets the designated size of the window w in order from the scan position ° for the image information zei composed of all of the pixel density values loaded in the memory adds cumulatively all of the pixel density values included in that window w and calculates that sum as the area density value representing that window w s furthermore the processing unit  judges if the processing of the image information ei corresponding to the entire circumference of the end face has ended s and repeatedly executes the processing s while shifting the window w when the processing unit  judges that the processing of the image information ei corresponding to the entire circumference of the end face has ended yes at s for example it links the scan position θ and the area density value obtained for the window w set at each scan position and generates profile information regarding the density as the density state information showing the state of density in the scan direction of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  being inspected for example as shown in fig  if the image information ei includes portions d d d d and d where the density levels greatly differ compared with the density level of the background profile information pf where the area density values at the scan positions θ θ θ θ θ corresponding to those portions stick out is obtained the position resolution in this profile information is determined by the set width of the window w the processing unit  when generating profile information density state information regarding the density in the above way uses that profile information to perform processing for judging the roughness of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  being inspected s the local surface slant relief shapes etc of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  causes changes in the level of the density signal output from the line sensor  so the profile information density state information obtained based on the density signal from the line sensor  shows the state of roughness of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  in the scan direction therefore in the roughness judgment processing s it is judged if the area density value at each scan position in the profile information exceeds a predetermined threshold value lth furthermore it is judged that the surface of the portion of the peripheral end face  corresponding to a scan position with an area density value exceeding that threshold value lth is particularly rough and that at that portion there is a scratch or other defect for example from the profile information shown in fig  it is judged that the surfaces of the portions of the peripheral end face  corresponding to the scan positions θ and θ with area density values exceeding the threshold value lth are particularly rough and that at those portions there are scratches or other defects further the processing unit  together with the roughness judgment processing s can make the monitor unit  display the profile of the roughness based on the profile information display control in this case for example the profile pf shown in fig  is displayed on the monitor unit  so the operator can judge the state of roughness of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  being inspected based on the profile pf displayed on the monitor unit  further the roughness judgment processing s is not limited to the abovementioned processing for example as shown in fig  by comparing the profile information pfi pfj and pfk obtained for a plurality of windows wi wj and wk of different widths the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  can be judged for roughness the profile information obtained for a wide width window can express the state of the relatively low frequency component of the image information ei further the profile information obtained for a narrow width window can express the state of the relatively high frequency component of the image information ei in this way by comparing the states of the different frequency components of the image information ei the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  can be judged for roughness for example when the plurality of profile information pfi pfj and pfk corresponding to the different frequency components of the image information ei fluctuate in the same way the peripheral end face  can judge that the surface is relatively stable on the other hand when the deviation in scan positions of the peak values at the plurality of profile information pfi pfj and pfk corresponding to the different frequency components of the image information ei is large it can be judged that the portions of the peripheral end face  corresponding to the vicinities of the scan positions are rough furthermore in the roughness judgment processing s it is possible to calculate parameters corresponding to the parameters showing the roughness prescribed in the jis from the obtained profile information as shown in figs a b and c and judge the roughness of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  by that parameter note that the profiles shown in figs a b and c are for the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  of a diameter of about  cm the total peripheral length l from the scan position ° to the scan position ° becomes about  mm in the example shown in fig a it is possible to calculate the parameter corresponding to the arithmetic average roughness ra prescribed in jis b in accordance with equation  in the example shown in fig b it is possible to calculate the parameter corresponding to the maximum height ry prescribed in jis b in accordance with equation  further in the example shown in fig c it is possible to calculate the parameter corresponding to the mean span sm of the relief shapes prescribed in jis b in accordance with equation  according to the abovementioned surface roughness inspection system it becomes possible to scan the peripheral end face  in a direction perpendicular to the direction along which the line sensor  extends in a state eliminating the effect of the degree of curvature of the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  being inspected and profile information able to show the state of roughness in the scan direction peripheral direction of the peripheral end face  see fig  to fig  is generated based on the density signal output from that line sensor  so that it becomes possible to suitably inspect the surface roughness even if the peripheral end face  of the semiconductor wafer  is curved in the abovementioned example profile information was generated using the area density value of each window but the invention is not limited to this for example it is also possible to generate profile information based on the moving average of the area density value for a plurality of windows for example the value obtained by averaging the area density values while shifting a window one pixel worth at a time the abovementioned roughness judgment processing s in fig  will be explained in further detail further the result in this judgment processing can be utilized for confirming the endpoint of the process for mirror polishing the wafer end face endpoint of polishing when the semiconductor wafer  being inspected is a bare wafer there is a large amount of light reflected at the surface and the density level becomes low therefore in this case for example as shown in fig a profile information showing the area density value corresponding to each scan position θ prepared by a predetermined window width w becomes a relatively low density level of the background in roughness judgment processing predicated on profile information of a relatively low density level of the background a relatively low level judgment line th threshold value is set due to this for example as shown in fig b from profile information partially including the density level exceeding the judgment line th it is possible to judge objects where the surface roughness is not uniform and the state of polishing is not that good further from profile information that parts where the density level exceeding the judgment line th are uniformly present across the entire scan position  degree to  degrees the extent of polishing is still not sufficient but it is possible to judge that the roughness of the surface is uniform furthermore as shown in fig c from profile information with no locations where the density level exceeds the judgment line th it is possible to judge that the surface roughness is uniform and the endpoint of the polishing has been reached next when the semiconductor wafer  being inspected is for example a product wafer on which a film is formed the light reflected at the surface is affected by the film and the density level becomes higher than the case of a bare wafer therefore in this case for example as shown in fig a the profile information becomes a high density level overall for this reason in the abovementioned way it is not possible to use the judgment line th used for processing for inspection of a bare wafer as is for the case of inspection of a product wafer the difference between the profile information for a bare wafer see fig a and the profile information for a product wafer formed with a film see fig a is due to the offset value δo based on the difference of the density level of the background therefore by finding this amount of offset δo it is possible to judge the surface roughness of a product wafer by the same judgment reference judgment line th as the surface roughness of a bare wafer the density level of the background can be viewed as being substantially constant over the entire scan position θ therefore the profile informations obtained by changing the window width w in various ways have frequency characteristics in accordance with the window width w but the part corresponding to the density level of the background becomes substantially the same density level no matter what the frequency characteristic of the profile information from this for example it is possible to generate a plurality of profile information for a semiconductor wafer  and set the lowest density level among the density levels becoming substantially the same in the different profile information as the offset value δo for example it is possible to use the thus determined offset value δo and the judgment level th used in the case of a bare wafer to determine a new judgment value th in accordance with thlthδo in this case for example as shown in fig b even if the overall density level is high it is possible to judge that the surface roughness is uniform and that the endpoint of polishing has been reached from profile information with no locations of a density level over a judgment line th other than broken line part on the other hand as shown in fig c it is possible to judge that the surface roughness is not uniform and the state of polishing is not that good from profile information partially including a density level over a judgment line th in a semiconductor wafer  formed with a film excessive polishing sometimes results in the film being ground off in this case a greater amount of light is reflected at the parts from which the film has been peeled off and the density level becomes lower from this for example it is possible to set the offset value δo found as explained above as the lower limit judgment level tho in this case as shown by the broken line of fig b and further as shown in fig c from profile information including parts of a density level falling under the lower limit judgment line tho it is possible to judge that polishing has been performed over the endpoint of polishing furthermore specifically from the broken line parts of the profile information of fig b it is possible to judge that the surface roughness is relatively even but that excessive polishing has been performed from the profile information of fig c it is possible to judge that excessive polishing has partially been performed due to some sort of abnormality in the apparatus by the way this surface roughness inspection system detects the surface roughness of the object based on the optically detected density information area density value therefore the effects of slant or offset of the semiconductor wafer  being inspected on the wafer rotary aligner  and further warping of the surface of the semiconductor wafer  etc having nothing to do with surface roughness may also appear in the density information so sometimes it is not possible to accurately judge the surface roughness from just the profile information of a single frequency characteristic due to the slant or offset etc of the semiconductor wafer  the fluctuations appearing in the density information become relatively long in period for that reason the effects of slant or offset etc of the semiconductor wafer appear in the profile information with a relatively long period further the fluctuations appearing in the density information due to warping of the surface of the semiconductor wafer  become shorter in period compared with the case of a slant etc but become longer in period compared with the case of the abovementioned surface roughness for that reason the effects of warping of the surface of the semiconductor wafer  appear by a period of a medium length in the profile information if enlarging the window width w by  pixel at a time and generating profile information from the pixel density data acquired from the entire circumference of the end face of the semiconductor wafer  theoretically as shown by fig a showing the case of a bare wafer and by b showing the case of a product wafer it is possible to obtain profile information giving the shortest wavelength high frequency characteristic corresponding to one pixel pitch from profile information giving the longest wavelength low frequency characteristic where the scan position  degree to  degree becomes one wavelength as shown by fig a showing the case of a bare wafer and by b showing the case of a product wafer in this way from the profile information of the various frequency characteristics one or more profile information are selected from the remaining profile information after eliminating the profile information of the relatively low frequency large period where the effects of the slant or offset etc of the semiconductor wafer appear and profile information of the medium frequency medium period where the effects of warping of the surface of the semiconductor wafer  appear furthermore the surface roughness and the state of polishing are judged overall by applying the above judgment levels see fig  and fig  to that selected profile information by the way as explained above the judgment line used for judging the surface roughness can for example be determined in accordance with the routine shown in fig  in this case the processing is performed on a semiconductor wafer  found to be good in advance reference wafer in fig  the frequency of the profile information to be displayed is set s by changing the window width w for obtaining the area density value as explained above it is possible to change the frequency characteristic of the profile information if obtaining the area density value by a narrow window width high frequency profile information for example see fig  can be obtained while if obtaining the area density value by a wide window width low frequency profile information for example see fig  can be obtained therefore as the frequency of the profile information to be displayed a relatively high frequency s medium frequency m and relatively low frequency l are set after this as explained above the density level which becomes substantially the same in a plurality of profile information and becomes the lowest level is set as the offset value δo s furthermore profile information of the three frequency characteristics set as explained above for example see fig  is displayed on the monitor unit  s the operator can generally learn the state of setting of a semiconductor wafer  slant offset etc from the lowest frequency l among the three profile information displayed on the monitor unit  can generally learn the state of warping of the peripheral end face of the semiconductor wafer  from the profile information of the medium frequency m and furthermore can generally learn the state of the surface roughness of the peripheral end of a semiconductor wafer  from the profile information of the highest frequency s after this the lower limit judgment level tho is set based on the offset value δo s further the judgment level th is determined in accordance with equation  using the level of fluctuation of the relatively high frequency profile information and the offset value δo a plurality of sets of judgment levels th th are determined in accordance with the grade of the surface roughness to be judged the thus determined lower limit judgment levels tho th are registered together with the id identifying the reference wafer the operator id and the time stamp s for example the abovementioned judgment processing is performed using the registered judgment levels tho th for the semiconductor wafers at the filmforming step polishing step etc industrial applicabilityas explained above the surface roughness inspection system according to the present invention has the effect that the surface of an object being inspected can be suitably inspected even if a curved surface and is useful as a surface roughness inspection system detecting the roughness of the surface of an object being inspected such as the peripheral end face of a
