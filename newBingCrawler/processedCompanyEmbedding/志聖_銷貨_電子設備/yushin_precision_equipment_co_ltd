however it takes time to suppress the vibration in addition it is difficult to set conditions for suppressing the vibrationwith the related art according to jp  a it is necessary to separately prepare a dynamic vibration absorbing device that utilizes the viscosity of the fluid and generates an appropriate resonant vibration according to changes in pickup conditions thus the dynamic vibration absorbing device lacks versatilityit is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for taking out a molded product that is capable of suppressing a displacement vibration of an attachment mounted at a leading end of each of one or more approach frames by active control using one or more electromagnetic actuatorssolution to problemthe present invention is directed to an apparatus for taking out a molded product including a positioning servomechanism one or more approach frames and an active vibration suppressing system the positioning servomechanism uses a motor the one or more approach frames are controlled by the positioning servomechanism and each have an attachment mounted at a leading end thereof the active vibration suppressing system includes one or more actuators and is configured to perform active control to suppress a displacement vibration of the attachment mounted on each of the one of more approach frames by causing the one or more actuators to

approach frames the attachment includes a pickup head a posture controller including a reverse section to which the pickup head is mounted a chuck device a cutter device and so forth in the present invention the one or more actuators are one or more electromagnetic actuators the one or more electromagnetic actuators are mounted to the attachment mounted on each of the one of more approach frames or each of the one or more approach frames such that the one or more electromagnetic actuators do not collide with one or more molding dies disposed inside a molding machine the magnitude of vibration can be set as desired in the electromagnetic actuators compared to the dynamic vibration absorbing device thus the active control can be applied to the apparatus for taking out a molded product with high versatilitythe one or more approach frames include a first approach frame having an attachment mounted at a leading end thereof and configured to pick up a molded product from the molding die or to be attached with an insert component to be inserted into the molding die and a second approach frame having an attachment mounted at a leading end thereof and configured to remove a waste part from

approach frames may also be inserted in an oblique direction or the horizontal directiondefining that a z direction denotes a direction in which one of the one or more approach frames moves into the molding die a y direction denotes a direction orthogonal to the z direction in which the attachment mounted on the one of the one or more approach frames approaches to or retracts from the molded product within the molding die and an x direction denotes a direction orthogonal to the y and z directions the one or more electromagnetic actuators include a first electromagnetic actuator operable to suppress at least the displacement vibration of the attachment as caused in the y direction this is because in the apparatus for taking out a molded product the vibration of the attachment as

actuator operable to suppress the displacement vibration of the attachment as caused in the y direction and a second electromagnetic actuator operable to suppress the displacement vibration of the

electromagnetic actuators are preferably mounted on the posture controller while the posture controller has a builtin mechanism operable to control the posture of the pickup head it is easy to secure a mounting space for the electromagnetic actuators in the posture controller and the posture controller efficiently transfers the vibration to the pickup head the posture controller is replaced much less frequently than the pickup head which significantly reduces the cost to implement the active control thus the posture controller preferably includes a container portion to receive the one or more electromagnetic actuators the presence of the container portion can prevent unwanted interference of the electromagnetic actuators with surrounding partsif the attachment mounted on one of the one or more approach frames includes a posture controller provided with a pickup head the one or more electromagnetic actuators may be mounted on the pickup head if the electromagnetic actuators are mounted on the pickup head the vibration can be suppressed most efficientlyalternatively the one or more electromagnetic actuators may be mounted relative to the housing of the posture controller such that the one or more electromagnetic actuators are positioned outside a bottom surface of the housing of the posture controller when the molded product is picked up from the molding die this allows the electromagnetic actuators to be mounted to the housing of the existing posture controllerif the attachment mounted on one of the one or more approach frames is constituted from a posture controller having a pickup head mounted thereon a pickup head fixture is preferably attached to an outer side of a housing of the posture controller so as to be rotatable between a first position and a second position preferably the pickup head extends along the approach frame and the one or more electromagnetic actuators are positioned below the posture controller when the pickup head fixture is situated in the first position and the pickup head extends in a direction orthogonal to an extending direction of the approach frame and the one or more electromagnetic actuators are positioned by the side of the posture controller when the pickup head fixture is situated in the second position with the use of the pickup head fixture when the pickup head is situated between the molding dies the electromagnetic actuators are positioned below the posture controller and therefore do not collide with the molding dies when the pickup head is situated outside the molding dies and in the second position the pickup head is in a posture for releasing the molded product also at this time the displacement vibration of the pickup head can be suppressed by causing the electromagnetic actuators to operatethe one electromagnetic actuator may be mounted onto an outer periphery of the leading end of each of the one or more approach frames so as to be positioned in proximity to the attachment the leading end of the approach frame usually does not get into a space between the molding dies thus if the one or more electromagnetic actuators are disposed on the outer periphery of the leading end of each approach frame the vibration for suppressing the displacement vibration can be efficiently applied to the attachment which is located in proximity to the one or more electromagnetic actuatorsthe active vibration suppressing system preferably performs active control for a period from the time before one of the one or more approach frames uses the attachment to pick up the molded product from the molding die or to place an insert component in the molding die until the molded product is released in a releasing position this not only increases the speed of pickup of the molded product and insertion of the insert component but also effectively prevents the molded product from being deformed by the vibration applied before the molded product is curedthe motor for the positioning servomechanism operable to move the one or more approach frames may be constituted from an ac servomotor and a transport mechanism of belttype ropetype or carriagetype may be provided between the ac servomotor and each approach framethe active vibration suppressing system further includes a displacement vibration detecting section an additional vibration detecting section and a drive signal generating section the displacement vibration detecting section is operable to output a displacement vibration detection signal a signal indicative of a detected displacement vibration proportional to a displacement vibration of the attachment the additional vibration detecting section is operable to output an additional vibration detection signal a signal indicative of a detected additional vibration proportional to an additional vibration generated by the one or more electromagnetic actuators the drive signal generating section is operable to generate a drive signal required for active control of the one or more electromagnetic actuators so as to suppress the displacement vibration of the attachment mounted on each of the one or more approach frames based on the displacement vibration detection signal and the additional vibration detection signal in the present invention the displacement vibration detecting section is capable of outputting the displacement vibration detection signal without using a sensor to be inserted into the molding die in the present invention the output from the displacement vibration detecting section is not affected by the temperature of an atmosphere between the molding dies and thus the active control can be reliably executed in addition it is not necessary to insert a sensor into the molding die and thus the sensor and the molding die do not collide with each otherthe displacement vibration detecting section which does not use a sensor to be disposed in the molding die may be configured to output as the displacement vibration detection signal a motor current signal of the motor used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the one or more approach frames or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal in the active control it is necessary to detect the displacement vibration as a displacement vibration detection signal including information on a displacement vibration frequency component proportional to displacement vibration of the attachment the inventors have found that a motor current signal of the motor used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the one or more approach frames or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal includes information on a displacement vibration frequency component proportional to the displacement vibration of the attachment from this finding it is found that the displacement vibration detecting section may be configured to output as the displacement vibration detection signal proportional to the displacement vibration of the attachment a motor current signal of the motor used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the one or more approach frames or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal if the displacement vibration detecting section detects a motor current signal of the motor used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the one or more approach frames or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal and obtains from such a signal information on a displacement vibration frequency component proportional to the displacement vibration of the attachment as caused in the x direction or the y direction it is no longer necessary to provide a sensor around the attachment or the molding die in order to detect a displacement vibration of the attachment the motor current signal of the motor and the torque signal can be measured at all times therefore according to the present invention the active control can be performed even when the apparatus operates outside the molding diethe displacement vibration detecting section may be configured to output as the displacement vibration detection signal a displacement feedback signal of the motor used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the one or more approach frames or a signal proportional to the displacement feedback signal this is based on the finding from the study by the inventors that the displacement feedback signal also includes a component varied in proportion to the displacement vibrationif the electromagnetic actuators are inserted into the molding die or disposed so as to be proximate to the molding die an additional vibration detection signal proportional to additional vibration generated by the electromagnetic actuators is preferably outputted without using a sensor to achieve a sensorless configuration specifically the additional vibration detecting section may be operable to detect a counter electromotive force caused when an electric power proportional to the drive signal is supplied to the one or more electromagnetic actuators and to output a signal proportional to the detected counter electromotive force as the additional vibration detection signal further the counter electromotive force can be calculated from a voltage applied to a resistor connected in series with an excitation coil a voltage across both ends of the excitation coil and an excitation voltage of the excitation coil the resistor is hardly affected by variations in temperature which contributes to achieving a sensorless configurationif the electromagnetic actuators are disposed outside the molding die the additional vibration detecting section may be constituted from an acceleration sensor attached to a mover of each of the one or more electromagnetic actuators and operable to detect an acceleration of the mover besides the acceleration sensor a strain gauge can also be used as the sensorthe term “displacement vibration” used herein means vibration of the attachment displacement the displacement vibration includes a plurality of vibration frequency components based on firstorder vibration secondorder vibration and so forth caused by operation of the one or more approach frames and the attachments thus the active vibration suppressing system may further include a phase shift correcting section operable to correct a phase shift of the displacement vibration detection signal outputted from the displacement vibration detecting section based on predetermined phase shift information and to generate a corrected displacement vibration detection signal in this case the drive signal generating section is preferably configured to generate the drive signal so as to suppress the displacement vibration of the one or more electromagnetic actuators based on a displacement vibration frequency component included in the corrected displacement vibration detection signal and having a phase shift corrected and an additional vibration frequency component included in the additional vibration detection signal a phase shift due to various factors such as the configuration of the displacement vibration detecting section is caused between the displacement vibration detection signal and the actual displacement vibration once setting is completed for the apparatus for taking out a molded product the shapes and the weights of the pickup head and the molded product to be taken out will not be varied thus the phase shift can be calculated in advance by prior measurement performed before pickup operation is started thus it is preferable to correct a phase shift of the displacement vibration detection signal based on predetermined phase shift information to generate a corrected displacement vibration detection signal and to suppress oscillation based on the phase shift in many cases the electromagnetic actuators are mounted on the approach frame or the attachment in order to suppress vibration of the pickup head the additional vibration detecting section detects additional vibration as caused in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction generated by the actuators and outputs an additional vibration detection signal including information on an additional vibration frequency component of the additional vibration if the actuators are caused to operate based on the corrected displacement vibration detection signal to perform vibration suppressing operation the active control is performed with the additional vibration frequency component of the actuators in the horizontal direction included in the displacement vibration frequency component if the active control using the actuators is performed with the additional vibration frequency component included in the displacement vibration frequency component however it may take time to suppress the displacement vibration or the vibration suppressing operation may cause oscillation thus the drive signal generating section generates a drive signal required to suppress the vibration of the pickup head as caused in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction so as not to be affected by the additional vibration frequency component based on the displacement vibration frequency component included in the corrected displacement vibration detection signal and the additional vibration frequency component included in the additional vibration detection signal as discussed earlier since additional vibration additional vibration frequency component generated due to the vibration of the electromagnetic actuators is included in the displacement vibration frequency component the vibration cannot be suppressed only with a drive signal generated based only on a detection signal including information on the displacement vibration frequency component thus the drive signal generating section can generate a drive signal which is not affected by the additional vibration frequency component by using information on the additional vibration frequency component due to additional vibration of a vibrator for each of the electromagnetic actuators operable to generate vibration for suppressing the vibration of the pickup head as caused in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction in addition to a detection signal including information on the displacement vibration frequency componentspecifically the drive signal generating section is configured to adjust a gain of the corrected displacement vibration detection signal and a gain of the additional vibration detection signal and then to perform computation to reduce or remove an effect due to the additional vibration frequency component generated by the additional vibration of the one or more electromagnetic actuators and included in the displacement vibration frequency component gain adjustment enables computation by adjusting the difference in dimension and amplitude between the corrected displacement vibration detection signal and the additional vibration detection signalaccording to the consideration by the inventors the additional vibration frequency component detected by the additional vibration detecting section is preferably a frequency component of a velocity of the additional vibration this is to prevent oscillation by increasing attenuation of the additional vibrationa displacement sensor may be disposed by the side of the releasing position so as to be operable to detect lateral displacement vibration as the attachment mounted on one of the one or more approach frames moves toward a releasing position where the molded product is released from the attachment oscillating in the x direction in this case the active vibration suppressing system is preferably configured to perform active control in which the

vibration suppressing systemthe apparatus  according to the present embodiment includes an active vibration suppressing system  illustrated in fig  and provided at the control section not illustrated in fig  the active vibration suppressing system  includes a displacement vibration detecting section  a phase shift correcting section  the electromagnetic actuator  an additional vibration detecting section  and a drive signal generating section  the electromagnetic actuator  is mounted on the reverse unit  to suppress the vibration of the attachment  as caused in the horizontal direction the electromagnetic actuator  is operable to apply a vibration to the attachment  in particular the electromagnetic actuator is operable to generate vibration with desired power and at a desired frequency in the embodiment an electromagnetic actuator manufactured by sinfonia technology co ltd product number rm is used in the embodiment the attachment  is constituted from the reverse unit  mounted on the approach frame  and the pickup head  mounted on the reverse unit  therefore as discussed earlier the electromagnetic actuator  is mounted to the reverse unit  this is because the reverse unit  has predetermined rigidity and therefore can effectively suppress the vibration in order to suppress the vibration as caused in the horizontal direction y direction or x direction the electromagnetic actuator  is mounted to generate a vibration in the horizontal direction y direction or x direction in order to suppress the vibration as caused in the vertical direction z direction the electromagnetic actuator  is attached to generate a vibration in the vertical direction z directionin the embodiment the displacement vibration detecting section  outputs a displacement vibration detection signal s including information on a displacement vibration frequency component proportional to the displacement vibration of the attachment  in the horizontal direction y direction the displacement vibration includes a plurality of vibration frequency components based on firstorder vibration secondorder vibration and so forth caused by operation of the approach frame  and the attachment  the vibration frequency components included in the displacement vibration are varied depending on the structure of a transport mechanism whether belttype or carriagetype provided between the ac servo motor  and the approach frame  in the embodiment the displacement vibration detecting section  outputs as the displacement vibration detection signal proportional to the displacement vibration of the attachment a motor current signal of the servomotor  used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the approach frame  in the horizontal direction y direction or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal it is necessary that the attachment  of the apparatus  should be advanced into a space between two molding dies therefore there is a limit to the increase in size of the attachment  to which the electromagnetic actuator  is mounted and there is little room in proximity of the molding die to dispose a sensor operable to detect motions of the attachment  to which the electromagnetic actuator  is mounted for such reasons even though technicians would have thought that the active control might be effective in suppressing the vibration of the attachment  it has not been proposed to suppress the vibration of the pickup head by active controlthe inventors who studied application of the active control to the apparatus for taking out a molded product has found that a displacement vibration frequency component proportional to the displacement vibration of the attachment  as caused in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction is included in a motor current signal of the motor used in the servomechanism operable to move the approach frames in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal and that there is no need to dispose at the attachment  a sensor operable to measure the vibration of the attachment  as caused in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction or to dispose around the molding die a sensor operable to measure the vibration of the pickup head as caused in the horizontal directionthus in the embodiment the displacement vibration detecting section  detects as the displacement vibration detection signal s a motor current signal of the servomotor  used in the servomechanism operable to move the approach frame  in the horizontal direction y direction or a torque signal of the motor or a signal proportional to the motor current signal or the torque signal if information on the displacement vibration frequency component is obtained from the signal s it is no longer necessary to dispose around the attachment  or the molding die a sensor operable to detect the vibration of the attachment  in the horizontal direction y direction as a result it has become practically possible to apply the active control to the apparatus for taking out a molded product in the embodiment in order to actively suppress the vibration of the approach frame  in the horizontal direction y direction the displacement vibration detecting section  acquires a motor current signal or a torque signal from an output from a motor driving amplifier  for the servomotor  in order to suppress the vibration of the approach frame  as caused in the vertical direction the electromagnetic actuator  may be driven based on a motor current signal or a torque signal acquired from an output from a motor driving amplifier for a motor operable to move the approach frame  in the vertical direction in this case the mounting position of the electromagnetic actuator  may be varied such that the electromagnetic actuator  generates vibration in the vertical direction as discussed later the attachment  may be mounted with a first electromagnetic actuator operable to suppress the vibration as caused in the y direction a second electromagnetic actuator operable to suppress the vibration as caused in the x direction and a third electromagnetic actuator operable to suppress the vibration as caused in the z directionfig a is a waveform chart illustrating a vibration waveform a representing the vibration of the attachment  during extraction operation as measured by a laser displacement gauge available from keyence corporation product name ils and a torque command waveform b for the servomotor  in contrast with each other the torque command waveform b was taken from a torque command output terminal of a servo amplifier available from fuji electric co ltd product name rytdlsz when the waveform a and the waveform b are compared with each other it is found that the waveforms a and b are proportional to each other when seen in terms of the peak values of the waveforms although there is a phase shift therebetween this is illustrated in fig b this is confirmed from the result of plotting the absolute values of points on the torque command waveform and the absolute values of outputs from the laser displacement gauge this relationship is also found to appear for the motor current signal of the motor when focus is placed on the first peaks and the second peaks of the two waveforms it is seen that there is a shift lead of  to  seconds between the two waveformsthe phase shift correcting section  corrects a phase shift of the displacement vibration detection signal s outputted from the displacement vibration detecting section  based on predetermined phase shift information and generates a corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ a phase shift due to various factors such as the configuration of the displacement vibration detecting section  is caused between the displacement vibration detection signal s and the actual displacement vibration once setting is completed for the apparatus for taking out a molded product the shapes and the weights of the attachment  and the molded product to be taken out will not be varied thus the phase shift can be calculated in advance by a prior measurement performed before pickup operation is started then in the embodiment a phase shift of the displacement vibration detection signal s is corrected based on predetermined phase shift information to generate a corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ to prevent oscillation based on the phase shiftthe additional vibration detecting section  detects additional vibration as caused in the horizontal direction y direction generated by the electromagnetic actuator  and outputs an additional vibration detection signal s′ including information on an additional vibration frequency component of the additional vibration if vibration suppressing operation is performed by causing the electromagnetic actuator  to operate using only the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ an additional vibration frequency component of the electromagnetic actuator  in the horizontal direction is included in the displacement vibration frequency component if the additional vibration frequency component is not taken into consideration however the vibration cannot be quickly suppressed using the electromagnetic actuator  without causing oscillation in the embodiment the additional vibration detecting section  is constituted from an acceleration sensor  attached to a mover of the electromagnetic actuator  and operable to detect an acceleration of the mover currently a semiconductor acceleration sensor for example may be used as the acceleration sensor  semiconductor acceleration sensors sized to be attachable to the mover are commercially available in the embodiment an acceleration sensor available from kionix inc product name kxr is usedthe drive signal generating section  generates a drive signal required for active control of the electromagnetic actuator  so as to suppress the vibration of the attachment  as caused in the horizontal direction y direction based on the displacement vibration frequency component included in the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ and the additional vibration frequency component included in the additional vibration detection signal only with a drive signal for driving the actuator that is generated based only on the displacement vibration detection signal s including information on the displacement vibration frequency component vibration may not be fully suppressed this is because the additional vibration additional vibration frequency component generated by vibration of the actuator is included in the displacement vibration frequency component then a drive signal sa is obtained for use by removing the additional vibration detection signal s′ from the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ is obtained by correcting the phase of the detection signal s including information on the displacement vibration frequency component the additional vibration detection signal s′ is proportional to the speed obtained by integrating an acceleration signal s from the acceleration sensor  including information on the additional vibration frequency component due to the additional vibration of the vibrator of the electromagnetic actuator  operable to generate a vibration for suppressing vibration of the attachment  as caused in the horizontal direction consequently it is possible to increase attenuation of the additional vibration to prevent oscillation thereby making the active control using the electromagnetic actuator  more effective as a result it is possible to reliably suppress the vibration of the attachment  in a short time compared to the related artfig  illustrates together with waveforms the configuration and process of generating the drive signal sa for the electromagnetic actuator as illustrated in fig  the drive signal generating section  includes a first gain adjusting section a a second gain adjusting section b and a computing section c the first gain adjusting section a adjusts the gain of the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ outputted from the phase shift correcting section  the second gain adjusting section b adjusts the gain of the additional vibration detection signal s′ outputted from the additional vibration detecting section  the first gain adjusting section a and the second gain adjusting section b enable computation by adjusting the difference in dimension and amplitude between the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ and the additional vibration detection signal s′ the computing section c executes computation to remove the additional vibration detection signal s′ which has been subjected to the gain adjustment from the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ which has been subjected to the gain adjustment in order to reduce or remove the effect due to the additional vibration frequency component generated by the additional vibration of the actuator and included in the displacement vibration frequency component if the polarity of the output from the acceleration sensor  is negative the computing section c performs an additionthe active vibration suppressing system  is preferably operating at all times when the apparatus for taking out a molded product is in operation with this arrangement the vibration of the attachment  is suppressed at all times thus it is possible to take out a molded product without deforming the molded product and to prevent the molded product which has not been completely cured from being deformed after being taken out by the pickup head in addition the molded product can be taken out early and reliably by the attachment  if the active vibration suppressing system  is operating at least when the attachment  is being stopped in the molding diefurther the active vibration suppressing system  may be operating when the attachment  is being stopped at a releasing position with this arrangement it is possible to prevent the molded product which has not been completely cured from being deformedresults of feedback controlthe results of verifying the effect of feedback control in the active vibration suppressing system used in the embodiment will be described below with reference to figs  and  first in fig  x indicates the result obtained when the active control is not performed x indicates the result of the active control performed utilizing an output from a laser position sensor as the displacement vibration detection signal and x indicates the result of the active control performed using the torque signal waveform s as the displacement vibration detection signal and using the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ obtained by correcting a phase shift lead of  seconds as in the embodiment the settling time is the time since a target position is reached until the amplitude of vibration of the reverse unit  falls within ± mm from these results it was confirmed that the same vibration suppression effect as the effect obtained when the laser displacement gauge was used was obtained in the embodimentfig  illustrates the test result x of vibration suppression when phase correction was not performed in addition to the results illustrated in fig  from these test results it was confirmed that the settling time was reduced to  seconds or less by performing phase correctionfigs a and b are a perspective view and a sectional view respectively of an example electromagnetic actuator ′ that can be used in the embodiment in the electromagnetic actuator ′ a mover ′b is disposed at the center portion of a tubular stator ′a and the mover ′b is supported on the stator ′a by three plate springs ′c the movable range of the mover ′b is restricted by stoppers ′d the electromagnetic actuator ′ operates on the same principle as a socalled cylindrical linear motor the stator ′a is fixed to the pickup head and the active control is performed when vibration of the mover ′b is transmitted to the stator ′a the acceleration sensor  discussed earlier is attached to the mover ′bother examples of displacement vibration detecting sectionthe displacement vibration detecting section  may be configured to output as the displacement vibration detection signal a displacement feedback signal of the servomotor  used in the positioning servomechanism operable to move the approach frame  or a signal proportional to the displacement feedback signal the displacement feedback signal is obtained by integrating the “feedback speed” that can be acquired from a commercially available servo amplifier for example it is indicated that the “feedback speed” can be outputted in the state display block diagram illustrated on page  of the users manual of a servo amplifier available from fuji electric systems co ltd trade name alphafig  is a waveform chart that is used to explain that the displacement feedback signal obtained by integrating the “feedback speed” is proportional to motor torque the waveforms in fig  illustrate the “feedback speed” outputted from the servo amplifier alpha manufactured by and sold by fuji electric systems co ltd a displacement feedback signal derived by adding a time lead compensation  ms to the result of integrating the “feedback speed” and the waveform of the motor torque of the servomotor driven by the servo amplifier the time lead compensation of  ms means that the phase of the integral value is delayed by an amount corresponding to a lead time calculated based on a prior measurement as is clearly known from fig  the displacement feedback signal is in phase with the motor torque and thus the displacement feedback signal can also be used as the displacement vibration detection signal as with the motor torque as discussed earlierother examples of additional vibration detecting sectionin the embodiment described above the acceleration sensor  is used as the additional vibration detecting section  however the additional vibration detecting section  can also be constituted without using an acceleration sensor as with the displacement vibration detecting section  that is the additional vibration detecting section  may be configured to detect a signal proportional to a counter electromotive force caused when an electric power proportional to the drive signal is supplied to the electromagnetic actuator and to output the detected signal proportional to the counter electromotive force as the additional vibration detection signal fig  illustrates an example circuit operable to utilize a voltage es across both ends of a shunt resistor with a resistance value r in

proportional to a counter electromotive force er generated in the excitation coil w the voltage es across both ends of the shunt resistor can be represented as esr×ir×vo−errorrror×vo−erkvo−er it should be noted however that k is a known proportionality constant represented as krror from the above formula the counter electromotive force er can be calculated as ervo−eskfig  is a waveform chart illustrating a component waveform of the counter electromotive force er obtained from computation and a waveform of integrated acceleration of an additional system additional vibration detection signal detected by the acceleration sensor  as is known from the chart the component waveform of the counter electromotive force er obtained from computation and the waveform of the integrated acceleration additional vibration detection signal are in phase with each other thus a signal proportional to the counter electromotive force er can be used as the additional vibration detection signalfig  illustrates together with the waveforms the configuration and process of generating a drive signal sa for the electromagnetic actuator using as the additional vibration detection signal the component waveform of the counter electromotive force calculated using the voltage outputted from the shunt resistor as illustrated in fig  the drive signal generating section  includes a first gain adjusting section a a second gain adjusting section b and a computing section c the first gain adjusting section a adjusts the gain of the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ outputted from the phase shift correcting section  the second gain adjusting section b adjusts the gain of the additional vibration detection signal s′ outputted from a counter electromotive force computing section  constituting the additional vibration detecting section the counter electromotive force computing section  computes a counter electromotive force er based on the formula ervo−esk discussed earlier the first gain adjusting section a and the second gain adjusting section b enable computation by adjusting the difference in dimension and amplitude between the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ and the additional vibration detection signal s′ the computing section c executes computation to remove the additional vibration detection signal s′ which has been subjected to the gain adjustment from the corrected displacement vibration detection signal s′ which includes the component waveform of the counter electromotive force which has been subjected to the gain adjustment in order to reduce or remove the effect due to the additional vibration frequency component generated by the additional vibration of the actuator and included in the displacement vibration frequency component if the polarity of the component waveform of the counter electromotive force is negative the computing section c performs an additionoperation periodthe active vibration suppressing system  preferably performs active control for a period from the time before the approach frame  uses the attachment  to pick up the molded product from the molding die or to place an insert component in the molding die until the molded product is released in a releasing position this not only increases the speed of pickup of the molded product and insertion of the insert component but also effectively prevents the molded product from being deformed by a vibration applied before the molded product is curedthe active vibration suppressing system  may be operating when the attachment  is being stopped at a releasing position rp as illustrated in fig  with this arrangement it is possible to prevent the molded product which has not been completely cured from being deformed a displacement sensor  may be disposed by the side of the releasing position so as to be operable to detect the lateral displacement vibration as the attachment  mounted on the approach frame  moves toward a releasing position rp oscillating in a lateral direction orthogonal to the horizontal direction and the vertical direction in this case the active vibration suppressing system  is configured to perform active control with an actuator not illustrated which is operable to suppress the lateral displacement vibration based on the output from the displacement sensor  mounted to the attachment  with this configuration it is possible to suppress most of the vibration applied to the molded product when the molded product is releasedsecond embodimentfigs a to d are a schematic

stopping movement of the approach frame while the molded product is being moved to the releasing position after having been taken outfigs a to c are a schematic perspective view illustrating an example of use in which the molded product m taken out by the pickup head  of the attachment  mounted at the leading end of the approach frame is cut off using an external nipper and enlarged

frame sf the external nipper unit nu includes three actuators ay ax and az mounted on a frame structure fc to which a nipper is attached the vibration of the frame structure fc as caused in three directions of the frame is suppressed by the active control using the three actuators ay ax and az thus according to this example of use the cutting work can be performed with both vibration of the molded product and vibration of the external nipper unit nu being suppressed when the molded product m is cut off by the nipper of the external nipper unit nu at the releasing position after having

electric power consumed by various types of manufacturing apparatuses including an apparatus for taking out a molded product japanese patent application publication no  jp  a discloses a conventional apparatus for taking out a molded product including a controller that allows selection of one of a powersaving operation mode in which the electric power consumption is reduced compared to the

mode the apparatus for taking out a molded product also includes a plurality of air driven devices that suction and take out a molded product besides electric devices such as motors that directly consume electric powerhowever the conventional apparatus for taking out a molded product does not allow a user to check how much electric power consumption has been reduced due to changed set conditions in addition the conventional apparatus for taking out a molded product does not allow the user to check the amount of air consumed by the plurality of air driven devices in use therefore the user has not been able to know how to change the set conditions in order to reduce the total amount of energy consumed by the apparatus for taking out a molded product according to the molded product to be taken out if it is attempted to positively reduce the energy consumption it is necessary to consult with a person who maintains the apparatus for taking out a molded product to determine the set conditions each time the molded product to be taken out is changed in the conventional apparatus since the user has not been able to know the amount of consumed air corresponding to the set conditions a compressor in particular must be operated at a capacity more than required if a plurality of apparatuses for taking out a molded product are used in a plant the total energy consumption can be known by providing measuring devices such as a wattmeter and a flowmeter for each of the apparatuses for taking out a molded product however such a configuration is costly and requires the

devices therefore according to the present invention it is possible to inform a user of the air consumption and the electric power consumption per predetermined period corresponding to the set conditions without using measuring devices then the user can be informed through display on the display section of the air consumption and the electric power consumption per predetermined period for the conditions set by the user himselfherself to check if the set conditions are appropriate this consequently allows the user to set conditions that reduces the total energy consumption the

alternately display of the air consumption and display of the electric power consumption may be switched by an operation made by the userin a specific example the display section may include a display screen the air consumption the electric power consumption and the instantaneous electric power may be displayed on the display screen in arbitrary formats for example the display control section may have the air consumption and the electric power consumption which are obtained for operations in one cycle and thus are not changed during one cycle displayed in numerical values meanwhile the instantaneous electric power which is fluctuated in real time is preferably displayed in a bar graph to allow the user to recognize such fluctuations this configuration allows fluctuations in air consumption and electric power consumption to be displayed in a quantitative manner and allows fluctuations in instantaneous electric power to be displayed in an intuitive manner which provides adequate information to a viewer or userthe consumption information storage section may be configured to additionally store individual air consumption information on an air driven device newly added to the apparatus and individual electric power consumption information on an electric device newly added to the apparatus this configuration allows the air consumption and the electric power

plurality of electric devices used in the apparatus  are divided into motor and one or more nonmotor electric devices and the individual electric power consumption information storage section  stores

power value if the motor is in the first constantspeed state the consumption computing section  adds the value of pnr to the integrated electric power value if the motor is in the second constantspeed state the consumption computing section  adds the value of pnr to the integrated electric power valueif the motor is in the first accelerating state the consumption computing section  adds a value of the instantaneous amount of consumed electric power instantaneous electric power corresponding to the speed of the motor to the integrated electric power value if the speed is v for example the consumption computing section  adds the electric power consumption pac to the integrated electric power value if the motor is in the first decelerating state the second accelerating state or the second decelerating state the consumption computing section  adds the electric power consumption pac pac or pac corresponding to the speed of the motor to the integrated electric power value the consumption computing section  computes the instantaneous electric power every unit time determined in advance through one molding cycle and integrates the computed values of the instantaneous electric power to compute the amount of electric power consumed by the one or more nonmotor electric devices per one molding cycle in the embodiment the resulting integrated electric power value is divided by the time of one molding cycle when one molding cycle is completed to compute the amount of electric power consumed by the motor average electric power consumptionthe method of computing the electric power consumption without using measuring devices is not limited to that described above if electric power consumption information on a motor as the electric device and electric power consumption information on one or more nonmotor electric devices are separately stored as individual electric power consumption information as in the embodiment the consumption computing section  preferably computes electric power consumption information in consideration of information obtained from the motor in the operating state such as actual operation time and information on electric power regeneration this configuration makes it possible to accurately determine whether each of the motor and the one or more nonmotor electric devices are in the operating state or in the standby state which enhances the accuracy of computation of the electric power consumption in this case it is a matter of course that a part of the individual electric power consumption information storage section  may be constituted from a storage unit provided in a motor drive devicethe consumption computing section  preferably executes computation upon termination of operation for each molding cycle this allows display of more accurate computation air consumption and electric power consumption obtained particularly in consideration of information obtained from the motor in the operating state also in this case the display control section  may be configured to cause the display section  to continue displaying when a command for display on the display section  is given this configuration allows the air consumption and the electric power consumption which are displayed according to a change in settings made by the user to be updated every molding cycle which allows the user to immediately recognize that the air consumption and the electric power consumption have been reducedthe consumption computing section  adds the computed amount of electric power consumed by the motor and the computed amount of electric power consumed by the one or more nonmotor electric devices to compute the amount of electric power consumed by the apparatus  in addition the consumption computing section  adds the computed instantaneous electric power consumed by the motor and the computed instantaneous electric power consumed by the one or more nonmotor electric devices to compute the instantaneous amount of electric power consumed by the apparatus  if an additional air cylinder or an additional motor device is added to the apparatus  in use the amount of electric power consumed by each electric device in one molding cycle may be calculated for addition in the same manner as in figs  a and bfig  shows an example of an image that the display control section  causes the display section  to display on the display screen  based on the air consumption and the electric power consumption computed by the consumption computing section  in the example of fig  the air consumption and
