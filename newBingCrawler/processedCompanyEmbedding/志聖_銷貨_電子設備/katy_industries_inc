products including consumer storage janitorial supplies scouring pads electrical cords surge protectors and garden lighting the firms customer base includes commercial and consumer retail outlets as well as original equipment manufacturers katy industries has facilities in eleven states and three countries early history katy industries was born out of an acquisition of the missourikansastexas railroad mkt a financially troubled operation that was in need of a profitable parent company wallace carroll whose knowledge of railroads dated back to his job as a section hand that helped pay his way through boston college became acquainted with mkt many years later when he was persuaded that the ailing railroad had some attractive aspects that outweighed its reputation as a moneyloser in particular carroll was attracted by its new york stock exchange listing and the  million tax loss it would provide for his own company american gage katy industries became the parent holding company of mkt because the railroad company purchased  of the stock of carrolls american gage with this purchase wallace carroll became the chairman and majority stock owner of katy industries which listed on the new york stock exchange in  carrolls experience with company acquisitions and expansions began in  when he established a gauge business in illinois he had left new england for chicago in  after he was hired as a salesman for a rhode island precision gauge maker four years later he was selling gauges on his own however producing the gauges seemed a more profitable business than selling them and thus carroll borrowed  and took on a partner to start his manufacturing business carroll did not regret moving into the manufacturing business but he did regret going into a partnership i promised myself id operate alone from that moment on he stated and he has held to that promise ever since carrolls entry into the gauge manufacturing business was timely as with most manufacturing companies during world war ii carrolls american gage grew rapidly because of an insatiable wartime demand for products such as gauges by the end of the war american gage was doing so well that carroll was able to begin purchasing other small manufacturing businesses carroll wisely made his acquisitions based on a peacetime economy in particular one of the companies that he bought after the war was a manufacturer of pots and pans by  carrolls holdings had grown large enough that he established american gage and machine company of which he became sole owner as a way in which to contain his holdings during this time carrolls formula for acquiring companies as a general rule was to pay cash he looked for small familyowned businesses that produced both a good product and a substantial profit his preference was to keep the original management but if the management was comprised of older men then his policy was to make them consultants or honorary officers and hire a younger generation to manage the company while carroll was successfully developing american gage the mkt railroad was having its share of problems several years before the creation of katy industries mkt was on the verge of bankruptcy the katy as the railroad is nicknamed included  miles of damaged roadbed from missouri to texas on which derailments were likely to occur if the cars were moving faster than  miles per hour shipment of stock would often he damaged and very few shippers would allow their products to be transported on the katy as a result by march  only  cars were moving on a daily basis however by october   cars were moving daily the cause for this substantial increase in activity on the katy lines was a nonstop talker name john barriger who came on board to save the railroad from its bankrupt condition barriger did not expect that the katy would ever become a prosperous railroad but he did hope that he could rebuild it so that a larger railroad company would be enticed into a merger barriger had spent many years around the railroads of the country after his graduation from mit in  he worked for the pennsylvania railroad and then moved on to calvin bullock limited a wall street firm where he worked as an industry analyst and inspected the nations railroads during world war ii he was associate director of the office of defense transportation after the war he headed the monon railroad which was almost bankrupt when he left in  barriger had managed not only to save the railroad from bankruptcy but also to establish a sound financial basis for its future operations in  barriger was nearing retirement age at the pittsburg  lake erie railroad company when he heard that the katy was in need of talented management preferring the excitement of his work and the challenge of the katy over retirement he took on the job as the new president of mkt barriger relied on his friends to help improve the railroad by repairing the roadbeds as much as he could within the first few weeks of his presidency and by making deals with his numerous railroad friends to the effect that their use of the katy would be returned through payment of back damage claims and improved service barriger was able to increase the number of cars moving on the katy lines within a short period of time the return to creditable service on the katy was a difficult task the poor condition of the roadbed meant spending any profits on the railroad still its reputation as a moneyloser had not prevented barriger from saving it from bankruptcy and although his hope that a merger with a larger railroad would take place was not realized the railroad company looked strong enough for a parent company to give it the kind of support it needed barriger continued his presidency only long enough to get the katy in a strong operating position diversification of katy in the late s and s katy industries quickly began to diversify after the acquisition of the mkt carroll separated the company into four very different groups the electrical equipment and products group the industrial machinery equipment and products group the consumer products group and the oil field and other services group by  the company was expanding into european and canadian markets particularly within the oil and gas exploration fields one of the most important acquisitions for katy industries in the late s was that of bee gee shrimp a collection of companies that operated a trawler fleet off the coast of georgetown guyana that harvested and sold shrimp bee gee shrimp was primarily responsible for doubling the sales and earnings of katys consumer products group in  and this allowed katy a degree of comfort during the recession years even the mkt was showing a profit for the first time since  in  the katy made a  profit which proved its ability to operate on a breakeven basis however the profits were put back into the railroad particularly in the area of track maintenance which was a high  percent of operating costs that year by  another man with a reputation of being able to tackle tough jobs was at the katy reginald whitman became president and chairman of mkt in  and is credited with keeping the company headed in a profitable direction whitmans confidence that the katy would not only be profitable but that it would also grow was an important aspect of the future earnings of the company by  neither the railroads negative book value of  million nor its net deficit was consolidated in katys annual report the company did not have to write off the railroads losses against its consolidated earnings in addition katy no longer had to carry the railroads large debt on its balance sheet for katy the railroad provided a shelter that was important to its acquisitions between  and  katy purchased  companies for approximately  million most of the companies were small and privately owned once they were put behind the tax shelter of the railroad their profits increased significantly by this time katy was considered to be a diversified investment fund which was different from others of its kind because it usually owned a majority if not  percent of its affiliates stock wh murphy treasurer of katy regarded this policy as one which allowed a uniformity of overall corporate policy as well as the exchange of technology marketing purchasing and financial assistance within the companies katys formula for acquiring companies did not change significantly over the years carroll continued to purchase small companies that had good product lines and presented small risks as carroll stated if it is profitable or we could make it profitable we buy it it was also carrolls policy to buy companies that already had good management in order to give the division manager a sizable amount of autonomy in addition katy offered incentives to its subsidiaries which were based on earning increases as a means of keeping the companies productive and efficient this formula was a successful one for katy its net growth increased from  million in  to  million in  katy managed to increase sales throughout the recession years of the early s in fact its earnings were so good that katy expanded its pump manufacturing company labour pump which was located in ireland in  katy began to expand into the silverware business carroll first purchased wallace silversmith inc in august and then purchased insilco corporations international unit around october of the same year these new acquisitions and investments in the early s represented some of katys efforts to offset the uneven earnings of the companys railroad and machinery operations by  plans were in the air to sell mkt union pacific had made an offer that required mkt to obtain  percent of the outstanding income certificates on the company mkt had only purchased  percent by mid union pacific then terminated the offer chairman carrolls comment on this turn of events in early  was that katy would keep on running the railroad its a good property katy needed to increase its earnings for  the company had some significant losses which were blamed on the casualty and property insurance business midland insurance midlands problems were caused by difficulties in the market katy liquidated the insurance company in the early part of  but net sales dropped from  million in  to  million in  in other areas however katy was experiencing new developments early in  katy announced that its subsidiary katyseghers incinco systems inc had been awarded its first contract to build a wastetoenergy plant it had taken the company six years to win a contract since the start of the business in  and the subsidiary was expected to see some profits in  at the time carroll saw the wastetoenergy plants as the future direction of katy industries and expected that there will be great demand and competition for these plants because of the increased environmental concerns of the nation specifically state and local governments were considering this form of incineration and if the trend continued in this area katy expected to be in the midst of the development of these plants a transformation begins late s during the late s and into the s however the direction of katy industries would change dramatically carroll retired leaving jacob saliba as chairman and ceo and william murphy as president under new leadership katy began its transformation which was marked by takeover threats restructuring and divestiture in  the company finally sold the mktwhich was in financial crisisto union pacific katy also divested its seafood business and by  its main business segments included industrial machinery and components consumer products and energy resources as katy streamlined its operations it became attractive as a takeover target in fact the carroll family which owned approximately  percent of the firm in the early s launched an effort to take the company private certain shareholders believed the offer undervalued katy and a takeover war began by  potential suitors included rosecliff inc pensler capital corp and steinhardt enterprises inc during this time katy elected a new management team john prann was named president while philip johnson became chairman saliba was named chairman again in  when johnson left the firm the company also moved headquarters to englewood colorado in order to maintain its independence katy distributed a  per share dividend to its shareholders to reduce its available cash and make it less attractive as a target the plan worked and katy was left to focus on a new restructuring effort that left consumer products electronics testing equipment food packaging machinery and specialty metals as its core business units the firm continued to sell off unrelated subsidiaries including panhandle industrial co and also made strategic acquisitions in  katy purchased gc thorsen inc a electronic parts distributor the following year the firm made a  million purchase of woods industries inc another electronicsrelated concern during  and early  katy made five acquisitions that included contico international inc a manufacturer of consumer storage home and automotive products and janitorial and food service equipment and supplies specialty abrasives firm bay state gritcloth wilen products inc a professional cleaning products concern the consumer electrical division of noma industries ltd and disco inc a cleaning products manufacturer catering to the food service industry by this time katy had also divested six companies and its machinery division a new focus for the new century as katy prepared to enter the new century it adopted yet another focusmaintenance supplies and electrical and electronic products revenues jumped from  million in  to just under  million in  as a result of its aggressive acquisition strategy in  however sales fell to  million and the company reported a loss of  million then in  the firm reported a loss of  million that year the firm took  million in charges related to restructuring and the write off of certain assets in addition sales fell by  percent in  due to weakening demand and the slowing economy as part of the companys cost cutting efforts it moved headquarters from colorado to connecticut and closed an office in chicago it also completed a recapitalization with kkty holding company llc it sold  million in stock shareswhich was mainly used to pay off debt saliba retired from his post in  and left c michael jacobi as president and ceo in  jacobi continued to focus on cutting back on expenses improving profit margins and new product development competition remained fierce and the recovery of the us economy was crucial to the success of the firm while katy had come along way in
