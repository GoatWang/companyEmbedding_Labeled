channels for bmw and mini dealer showrooms across the uk and ireland the music selection for each channel is designed to encapsulate the spirit of both the bmw and mini brands immedia has developed a music strategy with heightened brand symphony creating a closer demographic alignment between the music and their customers historically franchisees have been tasked with creating their own music playlists for showrooms ipods local radio stations cds and in some cases no music at all in every case providing the right audio ambience for the retail space has proven to be difficult now franchisees can order one or both of the official digital music channels relevant to each brand each channel is carefully mastered with hundreds of ‘brand tracks’ updated monthly “music and first

users to see every move fans could click presenter pics and get a mention to camera “it was a bit like seeing the first images from a radio astronaught saying hello to you by name” said brookes the station and its pop up audiovisual player soon attracted audiences from around the globe including thousands of developers notably from ebay and lots of search engines the project inspired further launches of interactive services in retail including impulse live specific to  convenience stores across the uk in partnership with the sun news of the world spar londis texaco and more back back the

service subscribe to the cool couture music channel ‘salon sound’ the mismanagement of music in a hair salon is one of the biggest issues in the business the cool couture music channel salon sound was created in collaboration with one of the industry’s leading global product manufacturers this enabled immedia to work with indepth consumer insights often used when creating new product innovations music is critical to the high end salon business not unlike the fashion business glamour is ‘multi sensory’ and the right music at the right time is imperative salon sound delivers a highly specific music library compiled by experts a combination of luxury sounds and expensive production cool and appropriate and sometimes fun effectively we have created an ever increasing library of  ‘sound images oozing in style’ whatever the trend from celebrated artists across a range of music genres a trip to the salon for a woman has to be an inspirational and invigorating experience a couple of

share the vibes start the conversation shake hands create fans anytime anywhere any place so what about the next  years as modern technologies connect billions of humans at the speed of a meteorite the window to the world has revealed the absolute realities of the planet in which we live for the good and bad almost every piece of the internet’s content sits in your pocket useful if you need to know something but is the stark commercialism of this technological phenomenon abusing its power over people we wonder how long this “push and pull” relationship will last strong indications of future trends suggests that the world is turning faster than we thought people will prioritise core values around their family as the generations merge with the elderly feeling younger fitter and healthier there will be new communities for the elderly and the new beauty is to share and care for those less fortunate give up on the greed eat fresh protest against waste and support the working class hero we will seek self sufficiency and an inner calm with mobility we will work no more than  hrs a week in an office there will be a new movement of urban nomads         we will want to feel safe and rely on new technology to make trusted decisions morph traditional with technologies only responding to relevant and personalised marketing we will become advocates and have the power to turn off blatant ad bombs thousands of new age communities will evolve wholly dependent on core values modern culture and varied interests digital media’s will be specifically controlled by those communities from the tiniest communities to brand giants people will be looking for that ‘emotional and honest connection’ interacting with completely relevant information at the right time in any place and powered by one

limited and avcme holdings limited together the avc companies for a cash consideration of £ payable in full at completion     established in  the avc business is a media and communications business and digital technology specialist the avc business encompasses a range of services which the board of immedia consider are highly complementary to immedias activities these include audio visual solutions video conferencing event productionmanagement video and d animation web and graphic design and app development  the avc companies work across many sectors and are particularly well known in oil  gas football and tourism  its past and current clients include leading brands and global businesses such as fa fifa shell bp aker sky and bt sport   the revenues of the avc business have declined rapidly over the last  months as prevailing low oil prices caused a number of oil exploration and services clients to reduce significantly their spend this has impacted the avc businesss trading performance significantly since avc medias last audited accounts for the year ended  march  which showed revenue of £m profit before tax of £m and net assets of £m  this decline resulted in the avc companies being placed in administration on  september    the board of immedia considers that the avc business can be returned to profitability by implementing certain identified cost savings synergies and cost sharing with immedia and other measures to be implemented post completion of the acquisition     as of today the acquired business will be renamed avc immedia and will operate as a division of immedia broadcast ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of immedia group plc   bruno brookes chief executive of immedia said    we have been aware of the avc media business for many years and believed that should an acquisition opportunity arise the business would be an excellent fit with immedia allowing us to enhance and broaden our client services  avc media has an awardwinning specialist offering and a very experienced team  unfortunately market conditions severely affected the business but this has enabled us to acquire avc media at a price which we consider to be advantageous    the acquisition of avc media strengthens immedias multimedia content offering for clients in the groups primary target sectors of retail workforce sport and education  avc has a strong client list and we believe that both businesses will benefit from working closely together generating excellent access and crossselling opportunities and providing a wider range of integrated digital services and solutions   in my chief executives report in april  i said that we have been extremely encouraged by an unprecedented number of strong and relevant opportunities from exciting businesses who want to work with immedia  this continues to be the case and we believe that the acquisition of avc media will both strengthen and enhance immedias offering and ultimate appeal to clients   i

broader client base within four strategic business sectors retail workforce sport and education we are at various stages of business development in all of these sectors   as the digital landscape continues to evolve brands and businesses are seeking to establish every opportunity to communicate with their audiences in the most cost effective and engaging way as content is king and relevance is key immedia has evolved its delivery to spaces and places together with rapid developments to its mobile offering i firmly believe this to be one of our most innovative and exciting areas of growth   results   revenue reduced to £ h  £ a decrease of  on the corresponding period in  generating ebitda of £ h  £ these reductions resulted from the expiration of our contracts with game and lloyds banking group in june  and a slower than anticipated conversion of our new business pipeline   the company has net cash of £ million at the period end   immedias investment in audioboom group plc the
