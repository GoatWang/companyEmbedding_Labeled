financier charles flint from these humble beginnings sprang the company that thomas watson sr would mold into a global force in technology management and culture in  biplanes dotted the air and ford model ts appeared in the streets forwardthinking people wired their homes for electricity and installed their first telephones in a belfast shipyard workers were finishing the hull of the biggest passenger ship ever the titanic the booming us economy was creating a new hunger for information there was a need to keep track to understand and to inform into that milieu stepped financier charles ranlett flint he worked out of an office on broad street just off new york’s wall street and invested in shipbuilding munitions rubber starch and the production of caramel by the early s flint had become friends with theodore roosevelt william mckinley orville wright andrew carnegie and other giants of politics and business starting in  flint attempted to build a number of trusts by merging several small companies to create one dominant player one of these trusts was in time clocks—the kind factory workers would punch on the way in and out of work the clocks helped employers keep track of hours worked and hourly wages flint took a number of companies that made recording time clocks including the time recording business of bundy manufacturing in binghamton ny rolled all the companies into one and called it international time recording co itr early international time recording company products the first dial recorder  model time clocks in itr service office  employees punching in on itr dial recorders  the  lineup of time recording products from itr employees of mexico’s power and light co clock in on itr time clocks around the same time flint rolled up several companies that made computing scales which weighed items and added up the cost of whatever was placed on the scale one of the largest of those companies was the dayton scale company of dayton ohio flint rolled all the companies into the computing scale company of america and made dayton the trust’s headquarters early computing scale company products a dayton meat slicer a dayton coffee mill a dayton coffee mill a dayton meat grinder “dayton money making machines” “the complete computing scale” scales in a mexico butcher shop  a dayton computing cheese cutter a dayton candy scale the dayton scale assembly plant  through the early s itr grew modestly and computing scale struggled flint searching for a way to help the companies realized that both were at their core about collecting quantifying and analyzing information—a mission that would actually be the mainstay of the company through the next century he was also at the time becoming interested in another informationbased company herman hollerith’s tabulating machine co based in washington dc hollerith had built the tabulating machine to count the  us census it sorted and counted information recorded by punching holes in cards and hollerith had begun selling the machines to governments railroad companies and retailers in  flint bought out hollerith and then merged the tabulating machine co with computing scale itr and what remained of the bundy manufacturing co the new informationbased entity was named the computingtabulatingrecording company or ctr headquarters moved to new york and the company operated factories in endicott ny dayton ohio and a few other cities very quickly hollerith’s tabulator emerged as the most promising technology in ctr’s catalog before the merger the machines had been used to conduct population censuses in a variety of countries including austria canada denmark and russia not only could the machines count faster but they could understand information in new ways in a census for instance a single card about three inches by seven inches could be punched with holes that form an information portrait of a person—city of residence age nationality job and more hollerith’s contraptions were able to sort through millions of cards and count how many teachers lived in chicago illinois or count any other subset of the population society could learn things it never knew it could learn and at speeds no one thought possible businesses quickly realized that the portraits on those cards didn’t have to be citizens but of a product a company sells or a freight car on a rail line or an insurance customer early adopters of the electric tabulation method included the freight office of the new york central railroad and the eastman kodak company which used a tabulating machine to keep track of customers and salesmen despite the progress the tabulating machine line was making as a whole ctr stalled in its first years after the merger so in  flint hired thomas watson sr to run the company it turned out to be an inspired move over the following decade watson forged the disparate pieces of ctr into a unified company with a strong culture he focused resources on the tabulating machine business foreseeing that information technology had an everexpanding future and literally creating the information industry watson also began expanding overseas—beyond the uk canada and germany where its products were already sold—taking tiny ctr global by  he renamed ctr with the more expansive name of international business machines the computing scale and time clock businesses fell away ibm grew to become the most significant player in every stage of the evolution of information technology over the  years after it was first formed ctr in the watson sr era the endicott ny

the company has changed ideas about how corporations should operate and contributed cultural touchstones such as the think signs punched cards the ibm ® selectric typewriter the ibm pc and the watson computer that won the jeopardy tv game show in  it has been a rich and historic century words from charles flint “i had the leisure to turn to a field which has since interested me more than any other one—that is the consolidation of corporations the forming of what used to be known as ‘trusts’ i have been called ‘the father of trusts’ although sometimes i think i have been more nearly in the relation of godfather” charles r flint founder of ctr precursor to ibm “fifty years a trader” system the magazine of business august  “in  i made a departure from the practice of bringing about consolidations in single industries by effecting a consolidation of allied interests that is by consolidating the manufacturers of similar but no identical products the computingtabulatingrecording co is of this class and although it is not the largest of the consolidations in which i have acted as organizer it has been the most successful” charles r flint founder of ctr precursor to ibm memories of an active life men and ships and sealing wax  at the outset of ctr i pointed out to the guaranty trust co that the proposed ‘allied consolidation’ instead of being dependent for earnings upon a single industry would own three separate and distinct lines of business so that in normal times the interest and sinking funds on its bonds could be earned by any one of these independent lines while in abnormal times the consolidation would have three chances instead of one to meet its obligations and pay dividends … the advantages to be realized by allied consolidations have been fully demonstrated by the computingtabulatingrecording company under the leadership of its president thomas j watson” charles r flint founder of ctr precursor to ibm memories of an active life men and ships and sealing wax  in  two years after thomas watson sr had been running ctr charles flint wrote the person who had referred watson to him “watson is living up to your predictions if in your travels you run across another watson i hope you’ll remember me again” charles r flint founder of ctr precursor to ibm “the future of this business gentlemen and our future success depends to a great extent on the progress we make along the lines of development and along the lines of expansion into new fields and into lines we are not touching today we must progress and we can’t do it any other way we can not stand still on development work” thomas watson sr ibm president time an ibm publication vol p  the teamthe expertise technical skill willingness to take risk and overall dedication of ibm

manufacturing his statistics tabulating machines in baltimore in  his machines counted the  census and results were available two years earlier than the  census the entire process cost an estimated us million less than manual tabulation in  hollerith’s tabulating machine company merged with two other companies under the auspices of charles flint to form the computingtabulatingrecording company or

shareholders or a waste of capital tim brugger timbrugger jul   at am as with most things theres a right time and a wrong time for a company to repurchase stock while it generally sounds good from a publicrelations perspective no matter the timing a company thats enjoying a skyhigh stock price could probably find better things to do with its free cash than buying back stock at historically high valuations ibm nyseibm shareholders however neednt worry that their companys ongoing sharerepurchasing  initiative is coming at ridiculously high prices because its stock remains woefully inexpensive compared with its peers the  million shares ibm has repurchased so far in  let alone the  million since the end of  havent had the positive impact ceo ginni rometty and team had hoped for image source ibm the upside by the end of the second quarter report  on july  ibm had  million shares outstanding down nearly  million from a year ago though ibm spent a whopping  billion on share buybacks last quarter as well as another  billion in dividends it still boasts cash and equivalents of  billion well above last years  billion as rometty continues to transform ibm from oldschool enterprise hardware to one of the leading cloud providers on the planet it could be argued that its fairly aggressive repurchase efforts will eventually pay off buying back stock while ibms stock price is under pressure is a sign of a management team confident in its future there are reasons for optimism particularly the continued growth in ibms critical strategicimperatives results which include cloud data security cognitive computing and mobile solutions combined the allimportant group of cuttingedge technologies generated  billion of ibms  billion in sales last quarter equal to just shy of  of total revenue the highlight of ibms second quarter was its  billion annual cloudasaservice revenue run rate softwareasaservice  saas and businessprocessasaservice bpaas are expected to generate a combined  billion in revenue this year and saas sales alone will nearly double to  billion in just three years ibm also generated  billion in cloud revenue the past  months which puts it in rarefied  air with the likes of microsoft nasdaqmsft and its trailing  months of  billion in cloud sales similar to ibm microsoft is also targeting the saas and bpaas market opportunities and its clearly working for both tech behemoths the downside instituting a sharebuyback plan while a stock is under pressure makes sense particularly if it positively affects the bottom line with fewer shares outstanding flat or even slightly lower revenue should result in comparatively solid pershare earnings results but thats still not the case with ibm despite its  million fewer shares compared with a year ago let alone the  million fewer in  ibms pershare earnings excluding onetime items inched up just  to  versus last years  by comparison microsoft is also in the midst of a share buyback and it certainly helped its bottom line last quarter microsofts  billion in revenue was good for a  improvement but with  million fewer shares available its pershare earnings excluding onetime items soared  to  keeping a good handle on expenses certainly played a key role in microsofts bottomline results but so too did its buyback initiative while its true ibms buyback efforts havent had the positive impact some had hoped for now is not the time to throw in the towel should investors be happy not yet but with its stock down  this year and  the past  months ibm investors will turn their frowns upside down in the long
