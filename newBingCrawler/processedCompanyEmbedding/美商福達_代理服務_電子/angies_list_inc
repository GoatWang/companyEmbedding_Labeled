equitymarketplacedistressed value investingsummaryangies list has been unable to significantly improve its key metrics retention is essentially unchanged revenue per member isnt growing and cost per member is nearly the same as before user churn costs are increasing angies list spent  million in marketing expenses to offset user churn in  this increased to  million in  net membership growth is slowing due to the increasing effects of user churn angies list nasdaqangi is stuck in neutral and is not making significant progress in improving most of its key metrics user churn is declining in percentage terms but that appears to be more due to changes in user base composition such as a smaller percentage of monthly members than an actual improvement in comparable retention rates as well membership revenue is continuing to decline while service provider revenue growth per member has appeared to stall as angies list increases its membership base user churn will become an increasingly large factor with angies list spending more and more just to maintain its user base for example angies list spent  million just to offset membership churn in  and this cost increased to  million in  the problem with churn angies list added  gross paid memberships in  up  from  gross paid memberships in  the marketing cost per acquisition went down slightly from  to  while these numbers appear to show a slight improvement from  to  once you add factor in membership churncancellations the results look significantly weaker churn increased from  users in  to  users in  as a result net paid memberships added actually decreased from  in  to  in  this comes despite increased marketing spend and as a result the cost per net paid membership increased by      gross paid memberships added   total marketing cost s   marketing cost per paid membership acquisition   membership churn   net paid memberships added   marketing cost per net paid membership acquisition   another way to look at it was that angies list paid  million just to keep membership levels stable in  and this cost increased to  million in  this situation is likely to get worse in future years as angies list has not made significant progress with renewal rates the average membership renewal rate was  in both  and  while firstyear renewal rates actually fell from  to  angies list has appeared to hit a wall in terms of improving renewal rates a review of q results as mentioned angies list did show a decline in user churn percentage from q  to q  however id attribute the decline to having a smaller percentage of highchurn monthly users and a more mature user base that has a smaller percentage of first year renewals coming up the first year renewal rate in q was unchanged versus last year and unchanged versus  as well so there does not appear to be a significant improvement in retention other than what would be predicted by user base composition changes   q  q  average paid memberships   cancellations   user churn   membership revenue per subscriber continues to decline this metric has declined by  over the last year and  since q  and has been in a continual decline over the last couple years it is uncertain where the decline in membership revenue will also bottom out   q  q  average paid memberships   membership revenue s   revenue per member   new service contract revenue per member also declined in q from  in q  to  in q  a decrease of  angies list appears to have generally hit a wall in terms of getting more revenues out of its service providers relative to the size of its membership base   q  q  service provider revenue s   contract backlog s   new service contracts s   average paid memberships   new service contract revenue per member   selling expenses have declined as a percentage of service provider revenue from  in q  to  in q  so there is some improvement there however the rate of this improvement is not enough to significantly influence the financial performance of angies list yet   q  q  service provider revenue s   selling expenses s   selling as  of new service contracts   as for other costs operations and support and technology expense per member have remained roughly the same while general and admin expense has declined compared to last year angies list is increasing capital expenditures in q  which will translate into higher expenses in future quarters as well   q  q  average paid memberships   operations and support s   operations and support per member   technology expense s   technology expense per member   general and admin expense s   general and admin expense per member   conclusion angies list has failed to make meaningful improvements in many of its key metrics over the past couple years while the average churn rate in percent has gone down due to a smaller percentage of monthly memberships and new members churn is becoming increasingly costly to offset as a result net membership growth is slowing despite increased marketing spend membership revenue is constantly declining and new service contract revenue per member appears to have stalled out in terms of growth meanwhile angies list is not achieving significant economies of scale with respect to cost nonmarketing expenses per member have gone down only  year over year despite having  more members compared to last year as well angies list mentioned on its q  conference call that it expects meaningful increases in both selling expense and product and technology expense i have been bearish on angies list before and see little reason to change that stance angies list needs to show that it can improve retention and demonstrate economies of scale before a higher valuation could possibly be assigned to it disclosure i have no positions
