consistency    usually different overall   manufacturer details speed  control  weight  plies  materials arylate carbon thickness  high tech blades with superb feel and extra speed for the  change carbon materials will be widely used in blades beyond  to compensate the speed but the downside of the conventional carbon blade is the serious loss of feeling the definite feeling for better control is the core competence for professional players wavestone mkii has focused on creating sensitive feel by introducing a new layer combination and special gluings arylatecarbon or soft carbon are carefully matched with selected woods to create the upgraded character arylatecarbon  arylatecarbon blade is made by the hybrid technology used by vectran fiber and carbon carbon offers high speed and excellent stability arylate a very good elasticity the blade was originally designed in japan but after consultation with the engineers at dawei we asked for this new version to be made it consists of a solid handle giving this blade back the balance it required we also insisted they made the handle longer  thicker to facilitate the larger european  australian hand this is a fast off attack style blade but with a vey soft feel providing a perfect combination of speed and control this is a hightech ply blade  arylatecarbon  wood it implements the new ib tech technology which improves speed balance control and provides better touch the high grade carbon layers provide a huge sweetspot the arylate dampens the excess vibrations caused by impact and provides a much softer feel to the blade this blade offer huge power at all distances and is outstanding for looping power drives smashes and blocking but has soft enough feel for some touch shots quote affordablettcomau this is the solid handle nonwrb version expand collapse reviews  seguso  on  very fast very spinny stiff blade with little dwell time it is very bouncy the feeling is soft but dwell time is very low less spinny than the galaxy t being harder but it has more power than the galaxy t i got one which weight  grams and another one more recent which weighs  grams so ask your dealer for the weight you like this blade is very good both with hard and soft rubbers i have used it with great satisfaction with hurricane   gambler outlaw  galaxy sun  the throw is rather low but not as low as other carbon blades such as galaxy t and the trajectory is long too fast for tensor rubbers at least at my level ratings  speed  control  stiffness  hardness  consistency  overall  accurate review it log inyou must be logged in
