lycos internet ltddirector reportprint mar   mar letter from the chairmans desk we had a very strong year and pleased with the performance this year i have to thank the various teams that had to push harder work extra hard to make this happen amongst the significant developments this year we launched programmatic product brightcom bringing together the legacy of ‘ybrant digital’ alongside the ‘brightcom’ media initiative we also renewed another year of relationship with yahoo across the globe for contextual advertising and our lycos life product featured among the top ten fitness bands in india business review coming to business during the year marketing was always driven by how users accessed the internet media years ago it was driven through a keyboard through displays of desktop laptop tablet all that is shifting at a very high level it is going from static images to very dynamic moving videos people are looking for more engaging content you can see at the content distribution level whether it is facebook or twitter or google all are shifting towards video we are seeing more and more usage on the video side consequently we see the advertisers are also shifting towards advertising on the video this puts us in a very unique position as we saw that coming last year while we had a sense we didn’t expect the speed at which the advertisers picked up one of the interesting things about video is that it is very engaging content so obviously conversion rates have been significantly better the mobilebased videos have picked up and as an intermediate medium social media continues to pick up these are the few things that are really changing and shifting things in going from text based to video based consumption of media we expect as we go forward that more voice based commands will drive this we witnessed growth in video advertising we saw massive growth in the programmatic buying which is automated buying through programs automated trading buying and selling of media through online platform for advertisers and publishers to address that market lycos launched a new division called brightcom this year brightcom brings together the legacy of ‘ybrant digital’ alongside the ‘brightcom’ media initiative this combines datadriven technology together with the company’s strong bonds with advertisers and publishers all in one consolidated platform gali arnon took on the role of ceo of brightcom she was transition out of her previous role as the general manager of the advertising division of lycos brightcom ranked number four globally in the video seller trust index done by pixellate and also featured amongst the top alternate ad networks published by monetizemorecom through brightcom we signed up with medula a large conglomerate targeting us hispanic population we are happy to tell you that we have made this partnership we have made partnership across all the devices at all levels including display video mobile and social all the areas we launched a product called vidin a video advertising solution that we have offered both to our publishers and advertisers the key feature that really worked for us we had a nice solution to address above the fold which is viewability and another feature that really worked for us is the ability to have custom sizes we were able to create custom size video ads based on where and how the ad demands the big part of which is the ‘video on mobile’ format in other significant developments majors steps were taken to cut out any sort of fraudulent botbased traffic we have signed up with geoedge to improve ad verification and then for fraud detection so it overall it again gives a very important security to the advertisers that this is a clean proper traffic that they can easily advertise in this challenging environment we are very proud to say our team has been able to sustain and grow in terms of lycos media we have renewed a contract with yahoo for global contextual advertising and we are pretty excited about it we see that as a big opportunity to grow revenue globally with advertiser fee that we get from yahoo plus we have partnered with ezoic which is part of the google relationship which will give us additional business we have added a local ad feed from dex media coming to the products we added vast engine to compass to sell video traffic to dsps demand

on the amazon in the us this product was picked as one of the top ten fitness bands by iot india magazine we are pretty excited about lycos life as a division in terms of key appointments that have happened this year mr ramesh reddy has been appointed as group chief financial officer he brings in a lot of experience expertise and knowledge from what the shareholders need and how to run a global enterprise he has always been a friend and advisor to lycos over the years the second one is dr jayalakshmi kumari came in as an independent director dr jayalakshmi also comes from a very different background she brings in an alternate view and added strength to the board and the third important appointment this year is ms gali arnon in israel she was already a part of the team she was the
