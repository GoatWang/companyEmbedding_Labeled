product life cycle stagesproduct life cycle stages explained home introduction growth maturity decline examples new product development plm software guide product life cycle stages as consumers we buy millions of products every year and just like us these products have a life cycle older longestablished products eventually become less popular while in contrast the demand for new more modern goods usually increases quite rapidly after they are launched because most companies understand the different product life cycle stages and that the products they sell all have a limited lifespan the majority of them will invest heavily in new product development in order to make sure that their businesses continue to grow product life cycle stages explained the product life cycle has  very clearly defined stages each with its own characteristics that mean different things for business that are trying to manage the life cycle of their particular products introduction stage – this stage of the cycle could be the most expensive for a company launching a new product the size of the market for the product is small which means sales are low although they will be increasing on the other hand the cost of things like research and development consumer testing and the marketing needed to launch the product can be very high especially if it’s a competitive sector growth stage – the growth stage is typically characterized by a strong growth in sales and profits and because the company can start to benefit from economies of scale in production the profit margins as well as the overall amount of profit will increase this makes it possible for businesses to invest more money in the promotional activity to maximize the potential of this growth stage maturity stage – during the maturity stage the product is established and the aim for the manufacturer is now to maintain the market share they have built up this is probably the most competitive time for most products and businesses need to invest wisely in any marketing they undertake they also need to consider any product modifications or improvements to the production process which might give them a competitive advantage decline stage – eventually the market for a product will start to shrink and this is what’s known as the decline stage this shrinkage could be due to the market becoming saturated ie all the customers who will buy the product have already purchased it or because the consumers are switching to a different type of product while this decline may be inevitable it may still be possible for companies to make some profit by switching to lessexpensive production methods and cheaper markets   product life cycle examples it’s possible to provide examples of various products to illustrate the different stages of the product life cycle more clearly here is the example of watching recorded television and the various stages of each method introduction – d tvs growth  – blueray discsdvr maturity  – dvd decline  – video cassette the idea of the product life cycle has been around for some time and it is an important  principle manufacturers need to understand in order to make a profit

example a seed is planted introduction it begins to sprout growth it shoots out leaves and puts down roots as it becomes an adult maturity after a long period as an adult the plant begins to shrink and die out declinedecline at this point there is a downturn in the market for example more innovative products are introduced or consumer tastes have changed there is intense pricecutting and many more products are withdrawn from the market profits can be improved by reducing marketing spend and cost cutting problems with product life cyclein reality very few products follow such a prescriptive cycle the length of each stage varies enormously the decisions of marketers can change the stage for example from maturity to decline by pricecutting not all products go through each stage some go from introduction to decline it is not easy to tell which stage the product is in remember that plc is like all other tools use it to inform your gut feelinganother marketing tool for evaluating product is the three levels of a productin theory it’s the same for a product after a period of development it is introduced or launched into the market it gains more and more customers as it grows eventually the market stabilises and the product becomes mature then after a period of time the product is overtaken by development and the introduction of superior competitors it goes into decline

where declines see the product promoted to regain customersstrategies for the differing stages of the product life cycleintroductionthe need for immediate profit is not a pressure the product is promoted to create awareness if the product has no or few competitors a skimming price strategy is employed limited numbers of product are available in few channels of distributiongrowthcompetitors are attracted into the market with very similar offerings products become more profitable and companies form alliances joint ventures and take each other over advertising spend is high and focuses upon building brand market share tends to stabilisematuritythose products that survive the earlier stages tend to spend longest in this phase sales grow at a decreasing rate and then stabilise producers attempt to differentiate products and brands are key to this price wars and intense competition occur at this point the market reaches saturation producers begin to leave the market due to

approvedwikihow to create a marketing plan four partsconducting a situation analysisresearching your strengths and weaknessesbrainstorming your marketing planwriting your marketing plancommunity qa a marketing plan is a plan that outlines your full marketing strategy for the coming year it will include who you are marketing to how you will market to them and the strategies you will use to connect with customers and attract sales the goal of the marketing plan is to outline how you will present your products and services to your target market steps part  conducting a situation analysis  consider your companys goals the goal of a situation analysis is to look at your companys current marketing situation from there changes can identified and made begin by looking at your companys mission and goals if your company doesnt have one then this has to be clarified before you start and determine if your companys current marketing plan is helping to meet those goals or not for example you may own a snow plowing and winter maintenance business and may have set a goal to grow your overall revenues by  by adding more contracts do you have a marketing plan that outlines how you will attract those additional contracts if so is it working  examine your current marketing advantages and challenges what is attracting customers to your business now what is attracting customers to your competitors business chances are your strengths are attracting customers to your business and knowing these strengths is an important marketing advantage come up with concrete definitive strengths and advantages that customers will find when they work with you these are called internal characteristics of the company and theyre what determine a customers level of satisfaction potential strengths could be low cost excellent customer service user friendliness or speed distinguish yourself from the competition this may be tied with your strengths or it may just be a fact of doing business with your company but if you want customers to choose you over your competitors youll need to figure out beforehand why they should do that you should also be aware of your companys potential weaknesses and shortcomings as these are also internal characteristics that matter to consumers once youve identified weaknesses you should begin planning ways to address those issues if you dont those weaknesses could end up being a competitors strengths  research your target market it is important to know precisely who are selling to in order to market to them knowing your target market and their needs allows you to determine where you should advertise and how you should advertise if you do not intimately know your target market you cannot effectively communicate how your products and services meet their needs  conduct demographics research you want to know the age gender location and even income of your customers you also want to know the psychology of your customers if you run a snow removal company for example and your customers are large businesses what are the things they value most from a snow removal service utilize official government data on both the market and industry you may want to look at economic indicators like price and cost indices as well as employment statistics in your state county and city if your budget permits it you may want to consult with trade groups or institutions that conduct their own research and analysis of markets and industry trends you should also research your competition the only way you will be able to offer customers something that the competition cant is by knowing what exactly your competitors appeal is do they offer better prices quicker turnaround time if so how do they offer those features are they cutting corners someplace else in their business plan knowing the competitions strengths and weaknesses is one of the best things you can do to help position your business for success  educate yourself on external opportunities and threats these are the external characteristics of your company and they are determined by your competition by fluctuating market factors and by customers or clients your goal here is to look at the various factors that could affect your business so that you can adjust your marketing plan accordingly begin by analyzing market trends such as observable shifts in what consumers wantneed and what they expect from a company like yours look at financial trends that may affect you like the rise in virtual payment methods or current inflation rates if you own a snow removal business and cater to large public sector institutions like government buildings you may be aware that tight government finances are making your clients more concerned on cost your business strategy and marketing plan should focus on how you can provide the lowestcost quality service part  researching your strengths and weaknesses  send surveys through the mail if you have a broad and dedicated client base you may want to consider sending out surveys this will allow you to poll your customers on your strengths and your weaknesses you can then build your marketing plan around your strengths and know what assets of your business to really emphasize and you can also make efforts to work on what others perceive as your businesss weaknesses keep surveysquestionnaires short and simple your customers may have input but they wont want to spend a lot of time and effort giving you that input aim for a survey that would fit on an index card or a half sheet of paper but if you must go longer make sure your survey comes in under two pages long at the absolute maximum consider a shortanswer format instead of a simple multiplechoice survey you can certainly incorporate a few multiplechoice questions if you like but provide openended questions asking specifics like what do you like best about our productservice what do you like least what would you like to see us improve on you may also want to ask a question like would you recommend our productsservices to friends or colleagues whywhy not that will help you gauge your existing customers level of satisfaction while also gathering information on what your strengths and weaknesses are include a selfaddressed stamped envelope you want to make the experience as easy and hasslefree for customers as possible dont forget to estimate the cost of printing and mailing surveys both ways and factor that into your existing budget if you decide to use this method  conduct email surveys these may be useful if you have a list of current customers email addresses which you might have collected anyway for contact purposes or for monthly newsletters if you have your customers email addresses you may want to ask them the same questions as you would in a mailed survey however the risk with email surveys is that they might be relegated to the customers spam folder theres no way of knowing how many of your emailed surveys were actually received by your customers and no way of guaranteeing that your customers will bother to fill out the survey even if they are received  conduct phone surveys this may be a touchy subject for some as many people feel annoyed when theyre called on the phone at home but if your business relies on persontoperson communication it may not be out of the question to conduct a phone survey you can ask many of the same questions that you would in a written survey asking customers what they see as your greatest strengths and weaknesses and whether or not your customers would recommend your business to others the downside to a phone interview aside from potentially disrupting or annoying the people being called is that you wont have the customers responses in front of you like you would with a written survey if you plan on conducting a survey youll need to have a fast writertyper to transcribe your customers responses over the phone this may require hiring additional personnel to conduct the interviews and write down responses which will then need to be compiled into a spreadsheet or catalog of feedback  conduct personal interviews this doesnt have to be anything too thorough you can simply chat with customers as youre ringing out their order or assisting them as you normally would but facetoface communication could be a great way to poll clients and learn what theyd most like to see improve within your business much like the phone interview a personal interview will still require you to make some written account of what your customers said and what feedback they offered this doesnt make it an ineffective or impossible plan to implement it just means youll need to plan ahead if you decide to go this route part  brainstorming your marketing plan  gather your information review any surveys youve conducted and determine how youd like to grow your business compare this with any realworld obstacles including current and projected market trends forecasted expenses that might arise in the near future what geographic region and demographics you have had the most success with and any competitors who also operate in that region or target the same demographics  assign roles as you move forward with your marketing plan youll want to assign specific roles to everyone responsible for the marketing of your business determine who would be the best fit for each role within your marketing plan and define what that roles responsibilities will be you should also determine how you will measure success for each roles responsibilities  declare your marketing goals what do you hope to achieve by building a marketing plan is your end goal to broaden your customer base to let existing customers know about new servicespromotions to expand into a new regiondemographic or something else entirely your goals will guide the creation of your plan your marketing goals should fit within your larger business goals when developing your marketing goals make sure your goals are tangible and measurable otherwise it will be difficult to interpret your sales and you may not be clear on what approaches and strategies were effective use outcomes like increased sales dollars increased number of units soldmanufactured increased public awareness or number of new accounts with clients for example your goal may be increase new contracts by  or increase social media presence  determine how to reach your prospects your strategic plan should target all three customer prospects cold prospects those who dont know your business at all reached through advertisements and direct marketing warm prospects those who are familiar with your business or at least have been exposed to your ads and marketing in the past and hot prospects interested customersclients who know your business and are prepared to work with you youll need to brainstorm how to reach all of your prospects which may play a role in determining which marketing strategies you employ for example you may opt to use social media radio ads signs or flyer distribution to reach cold prospects potential clients who have shown interest or worked with you in the past could be actively contacted by salespeople who are trained to use the information from your research to convince the customer that your product or service is the best solution to their problem  develop marketing strategies to meet your goals once youve decided on your marketing goals and prospects youll want to follow through on that thought process to determine what you can actually do to meet your goals and reach your prospects there are many different types of marketing strategies but some of the most common ones include corporate or instore events are a great way to bring customers in this could be a dinner a social activity or any other event that will impress clients motivateunite your staff or increase your exposure to potential customersclients social promotions are almost always successful thats because they promote your business while getting customers excited about your products or services these contests can be done instore or through social media and typically involve offering some type of minor reward in exchange for frequenting your business or following you on social media consider paying for a shortterm sponsorship from a reputable person or group of people who use your products or services these endorsements can even be done entirely online through social media it may not fit into every businesss budget as it can be an expensive option but its been proven to work for many businesses around the world dont overlook the value of clever or catchy advertisements finding your businesss voice and visual style in a given campaign can be highly effective  consider the role of social media various social media platforms can be a highly effective and inexpensive means of advertising your business and should be a component of your overall marketing plan social media can be useful for advertising specials discounts doing promotions and communicating with your target audience being active on social media keeps your business on the minds of customers consider writing blog posts or posting links about problems your customers may have and how your business can provide a solution discussion topics promotions and surveys can be ways of involving your customers in your business while simultaneously learning more about their preferences and deepening their relationship with your brand  set a budget you may have some spectacular ideas about how to market your business and reach out to customers but if your budget is limited then you may need to rethink your strategy your budget should be realistic and should reflect both the current state of your business and the potential growth you see in your businesss future assess your current finances you want your budget to be realistic and that means taking into account what you can afford to spend right now dont blow your budget on the hope that your marketing plan will bring in a flood of new business because if your plan isnt that successful you may find yourself hemorrhaging money start small with allocating your marketing funds and work within your means go for tried and true advertisements that you know have the highest success rate with reaching new clients dont be afraid to stray from your plan if things arent working in one area of advertisements say for example that your newspaper ads arent reaching the right people then try reallocating the time and money you would otherwise invest in that faltering avenue into other more productive means of advertising part  writing your marketing plan  start with an executive summary this section will include basic information about your product or service and will provide a general summary of the entire document in a paragraph or two writing this first can help you broadly overview the more detailed sections you are about to write this is helpful to give your employees advisors and colleagues and overview of your plan  describe your target market the next section will use your research to describe your target market this does not need to be complex and simple bulleted steps will work fine you can begin by describing the demographics of your market include age gender and location or occupation if relevant and then describe their preferences relating to the products or services you offer  list your goals this section should be no longer than a page here you will list all the marketing goals for your company in the upcoming year remember to apply the smart acronym to setting your goals  specific measurable attainable realistic and timely a smart goal would be grow overall sales to public sector customers by  before the end of   identify your marketing strategy this section answers the how of your plan and it will outline your overall strategy for marketing your goal here is to focus on your unique selling proposition or usp which is the main advantage your business has this should be more clear after brainstorming and planning your marketing plan your strategy will sell your usp in this section you want to describe how you will reach customers attending trade shows radio ads cold calls online advertising and the general approach you will use to convince them here you will want to focus on what you identified your customers needs to be and how your usp can help them meet their needs the key in this section is to be as specific as possible  write the budget in this section you will want to include the total amount of money you have to spend as well as how those dollars will be spent it is best to divide your expenses into categories and list the total amount spent per category for example you may spend  travelling to trade shows  on radio ads  on flyers  on a new promotion and  on optimizing your website  maintain an annual plan at least dont anticipate that your plan will go off without a hitch most marketing specialists recommend that a business revisits its marketing plan at least once every year this will help you review whats been accomplished assess how things may continue to progress based on current information and determine whether any changes need to be made to your marketing plan be objective with your annual reviews if something isnt working or if someone
