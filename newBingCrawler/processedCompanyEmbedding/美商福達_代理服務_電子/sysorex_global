results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k in addition to historical information this discussion and analysis here and throughout this form k contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors except where indicated all share and per share data in this section as well as the consolidated financial statements reflect the reverse stock split effected on april   overview of our business sysorex global sysorex or the company provides data analytics and indoorlocation based solutions and services to commercial and government customers worldwide we have developed a new kind of discovery platform that blends data from traditional software and network systems with the growing universe of mobile and internet of things iot in doing so we have created a high velocity secure and scalable platform that we believe allows our customers to evaluate their most complex business issues and compete successfully in their respective markets our products are designed to help customers derive real time value by combining both the physical and digital worlds these products and services operate and report among the following segments mobile iot  big data products storage and computing saas revenues and professional services sysorexs data analytics products integrate with our airpatrol product line which focuses on collecting data from any wireless device in close proximity cellular wifi ble rfid etc we believe we can provide the right information at the right time based on our integrated solutions allowing us to uniquely blend the real world and the digital world we believe that our airpatrol product line is also well positioned in the cyber security market as mobile device management and detection technology we believe that our location accuracy of sub feet and our ability to capture all rf frequencies is unmatched detecting rogue devices that could be a security threat to an enterprise or government agency and then providing accurate location of that device is an important security application for our customers our airpatrol product line has three patents and ten others pending worldwide sysorex also provides supporting products and services including enterprise computing and storage virtualization business continuity data migration custom application development networking and information technology business consulting services these allow sysorex to offer turnkey solutions when requested by customers our storage and computing segment revenues are typically driven by purchase orders that are received on a monthly basis approximately  of the revenues from these purchase orders are recurring contracts that range from one to five years for warranty and maintenance support for these contracts the customer is invoiced one time and pays sysorex upfront for the full term of the warranty and maintenance contract revenue from these contracts is determinable ratably over the contract period with the unearned revenue recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over the contract period we have a year history and a high repeat customer rate of approximately  annually our revenues are diversified over hundreds of customers and typically no one customer exceeds  of revenues however from time to time a large order from a customer could put it temporarily above  we have one customer that was approximately  for the year ending december   but we dont anticipate that this customer will continue to maintain that percentage as our revenues expand across other customers in  management believes this diversification provides stability to our revenue streams our softwareasaservice saas contracts are typically performed for periods of one or more years and we have a high customer retention rate sysorex saas product include etearsheets invoicing crm and other products and services to approximately  newspapers in the cloud cloud or saas based analytics is a growing market that sysorex intends to pursue beyond the media vertical that we are in today our mobile iot and big data sales are expected to grow significantly in  however sales cycles proved to be longer than we expected in  the long sales cycles result from customer related issues such as budget and procurement processes but also because of the early stages of indoorlocationing technology and the learning curve required for customers to implement such solutions this is improving with the increased presence and awareness of beacon and wifi locationing technologies in the market our professional services group provides consulting services ranging from enterprise architecture design to custom application development to data modeling sysorex offers a full scope of information technology development and implementation services with expertise in a broad range of it practices including project design and management systems integration outsourcing independent validation and verification cyber security and more events such as budget impasses and sequestration in the federal government could impact government customer funding for projects that our it government segment is pursuing by delaying payment or decisions on contracttask order awards as the company has experienced with prior awards however our government contracts are currently approximately  of our total revenues such government contracts typically have a three to five year term and we believe that our recent government contract revenues will be indicative of future government contract based revenues recent events reverse stocksplit in connection with the companys initial public offering described below and in order to satisfy the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market on april   the company filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation the certificate of

related prospectus on april   upon the closing of the offering the company received approximately  million from the sale of  shares in the offering excluding the shares sold by the selling stockholder after deducting the underwriting discounts fees and commissions the net proceeds of the offering were used in connection with the acquisition of airpatrol and will also be used to expand the companys

from the offering were used for general corporate purposes which included business development activities capital expenditures working capital and general and administrative expenses jobs act pursuant to section  of the jobs act emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected to opt out of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  of the audited financial statements for the years ended december   and  we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain there have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing historically changes in management estimates have not been material revenue recognition we provide it solutions and services to customers with revenues currently derived primarily from the sale of thirdparty hardware and software products software assurance licenses and other consulting services including maintenance services the products and services we sell and the manner in which they are bundled are technologically complex and the characterization of these products and services require judgment in order to apply revenue recognition policies for all of these revenue sources we determine whether we are the principal or agent in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  principal agent considerations we allocate the total arrangement consideration to the deliverables based on an estimated selling price of our products and services and report revenues containing multiple deliverable arrangements under asc  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables asc these multiple deliverable arrangements primarily consist of the following deliverables we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment software or hardware or fulfillment maintenance has occurred and applicable services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured generally these criteria are met upon shipment to customers with respect to the sales of hardware and software products with respect to our maintenance and other service agreements this criteria is met once the service has been provided revenue from the sales of our services on time and material contracts is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as direct labor hours are expended we recognize revenue for sales of all services on a fixed fee ratably over the term of the arrangement as such services are provided the company evaluates whether the revenues it receives from the sale of hardware and software products licenses and services including maintenance and professional consulting services should be recognized on a gross or net basis on a transaction by transaction basis we maintain primary responsibility for the materials and procedures utilized to service our customers even in connection with the sale of third partyproducts and maintenance services as we are responsible for the fulfillment and acceptability of the products and services purchased by our customers in addition the nature of the products sold to our customers are such that they need configuration in order to be utilized properly for the purposes intended by the customer and therefore we assume certain responsibility for product staging configuration installation modification and integration with other client systems or retain general inventory risk upon customer return or rejection our customers rely on us to develop the appropriate solutions and specifications applicable to their specific systems and then integrate any such required products or services into their systems as described above we are responsible for the day to day maintenance and warranty services provided in connection with all of our existing customer relationships whether such services are ultimately provided directly by the company and its employees or by the applicable third party service provider as of the date of this filing after an evaluation of all of our existing customer relationships we have concluded that we are the primary obligor to all of our existing customers and therefore recognize all revenues on a gross basis longlived assets we account for our longlived assets in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets asc  which requires that longlived assets be evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed some of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected andor historical results negative comparable sales growth or operating cash flows for two consecutive years  significant negative industry or economic trends  knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value or  our expectation to dispose of longlived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale longlived assets are grouped for recognition and measurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets the impairment test for longlived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of our longlived assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from our use and eventual disposition of the assets if the net carrying value of a group of longlived assets exceeds the sum of related undiscounted estimated future cash flows we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess if any of net carrying value over fair value when assessing the recoverability of our longlived assets which include property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors some of these assumptions involve a high degree of judgment and also bear a significant impact on the assessment conclusions included among these assumptions are estimating undiscounted future cash flows including the projection of comparable sales operating expenses capital requirements for maintaining property and equipment and residual value of asset groups we formulate estimates from historical experience and assumptions of future performance based on business plans and forecasts recent economic and business trends and competitive conditions in the event that our estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge based on our evaluation we did not record a charge for impairment for the years ended december   and  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision to the remaining period of amortization is warranted such events or circumstances may include but are not limited to the effects of obsolescence demand competition andor other economic factors including the stability of the industry in which we operate known technological advances legislative actions or changes in the regulatory environment if the estimated remaining useful lives change the remaining carrying amount of the longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life we have determined that there were no events or circumstances during the years ended december   and  which would indicate a revision to the remaining amortization period related to any of our long lived assets accordingly we believe that the current estimated useful lives of longlived assets reflect the period over which they are expected to contribute to future cash flows and are therefore deemed appropriate goodwill and indefinitelived assets we have recorded goodwill and other indefinitelived assets in connection with our acquisitions of lilien shoom airpatrol and lightminer goodwill which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company is not amortized indefinitelived intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination our goodwill balance and other assets with indefinite lives are evaluated for potential impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and in certain other circumstances the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill to determine the fair value of the business we utilize both the income approach which is based on estimates of future net cash flows and the market approach which observes transactional evidence involving similar businesses there was no goodwill impairment for the years ended december   and  deferred income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  management routinely evaluates the likelihood of the realization of its income tax benefits and the recognition of its deferred tax assets in evaluating the need for any valuation allowance management will assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized ultimately the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which temporary differences become deductible andor tax credits and tax loss carryforwards can be utilized in performing its analyses management considers both positive and negative evidence including historical financial performance previous earnings patterns future earnings forecasts tax planning strategies economic and business trends and the potential realization of net operating loss carryforwards within a reasonable timeframe to this end management considered i that we have had historical losses in the prior years and cannot anticipate generating a sufficient level of future profits in order to realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset ii tax planning strategies and iii the adequacy of future income as of and for the year ended december   based upon certain economic conditions and historical losses through december   after consideration of these factors management deemed it appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the companys tax filings that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards as of december   and  no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported the guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes the companys policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense no interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended december   and  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain our reserves for credit losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the respective balances we assign an internal credit quality rating to all new customers and update these ratings regularly but no less than annually managements determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for our accounts and notes receivable is based on the age of the receivable balance the customers credit quality rating an evaluation of historical credit losses current economic conditions and other relevant factors as of december   and  allowance for credit losses included an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  respectively due to the aging of the items greater than  days outstanding and other potential noncollections business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and inprocess research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date the application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions upon acquisition the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date stockbased compensation we account for equity instruments issued to nonemployees in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date which is typically the date the services are performed we account for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that awards are recorded at their fair value on the date of grant and are amortized over the vesting period of the award we recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the vesting term of the equity instrument issued the blackscholes option valuation model is used to estimate the fair value of the options or the equivalent security granted the model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates the model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options or warrants the expected volatility is estimated based on the average of historical volatilities for industry peers the principal assumptions used in applying the blackscholes model along with the results from the model were as follows december  december    riskfree interest rate  to   to  expected life of option grants  years  years expected
