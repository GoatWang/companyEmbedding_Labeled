growing continuously as the leading cloud integrator  company and business overview terrasky co ltd  hereafter also “the company” is the leading cloud integrator in the japanese market for cloud computing the company operates two business segments a solution business which supports the development of optimal systems that use cloud computing and develops such systems and a product business which develops and supplies cloud computing services the solution business provides  of the company’s consolidated sales and  of its operating income before adjustments while the product business accounts for  of consolidated sales and  of preadjusted operating income of total consolidated sales  comes from services that facilitate the use of services from salesforcecom inc and  comes from services that facilitate the use of amazon web services aws having provided integration services for the introduction of more than  cloud computing systems and possessing overwhelming number of topquality certified engineers the company easily attracts business proposals from other companies the company has established a mutually reinforcing cycle through which it and its engineers acquire knowhow and recognition through many past projects enabling them to gain new business the demand for cloud computing in japan is growing rapidly and the company holds a position of competitive superiority in the field of cloud integration which has great growth potential  fy financial results in the fiscal year through february  ie in fy the company’s consolidated net sales grew  year on year yoy to ¥mn but its operating income decreased by  to ¥mn in the solution business sales increased  yoy to ¥mn while operating income fell  to ¥mn in the product business sales advanced  yoy to ¥mn and operating income rose  to ¥mn as salesforcecom increased its sales in japan the company expanded its sales of products for salesforce services supporting the large sales increase in the product business and an upturn in the business’s operating income despite the costs of promoting a new product called mitoco and an increase in personnel costs in the business in the solution business sales jumped  yoy reflecting an increase in the number of large orders received and an increase in the need to improve projects completed earlier however operating income in the solution business declined yoy because of several factors including an increase in the number of engineers in the business an increase in the amount of subcontracted work and the prolongation of special development projects  fy company forecast for fy the company projects a  yoy increase in consolidated net sales to ¥mn and a  rise in consolidated operating income to ¥mn sales in the solution business are projected to grow  to ¥mn and sales in the product business are seen climbing by  to ¥mn however operating income growth is seen to be limited by the costs of developing new products and of increasing the work force  company targets ordinary income of ¥bn for fy but still in the investment phase of expansion the company’s mediumterm plan of operations aims to earn a consolidated ordinary income of ¥bn in fy while sales should continue to expand rapidly yoy through fy profits and profit margins are likely to grow modestly through fy because of heavy investments in personnel and new products profits and margins should expand more rapidly from fy ◆ company profile a topclass cloud integrator in japan  company profile terrasky co is japan’s topclass cloud integrator since its founding in  the company has specialized in cloud computing services contributing significantly to the development of the cloud computing market in japan salesforce and aws hold the largest shares of the japanese market for the cloud computing services in which terrasky specializes terrasky has provided services for the implementation of more than  cloud computing contracts in japan its customers span the ranges of size and industry terrasky has five consolidated subsidiaries including terrasky inc sky co ltd beex inc cloudia japan inc and kitalive inc an affiliate serverworks co ltd is accounted for by the equity method in its consolidated accounts  history the company was established as head inc in  to specialize in the development of cloud computing services company president hideya sato left ibm japan ltd to join the japanese subsidiary of salesforcecom inc crm which he helped to expand in  the company changed its name to terrasky co ltd in  the company started marketing its skyeditor screen development service and its skyondemand data integration service in  the company released the appcomponent service which enable systems developers and vendors enhance the capabilities of the skyvisualeditor screen development service and provide application programs in  the company started selling its cloud erp concierge service its automigration for notes package which enables the automatic migration from notes to salesforce and its hybrid cloud solution service in  the company entered a new field of business by launching sales of its mitoco socialware service in  terrasky concluded an equity investment and business development contract with ntt software corporation now called ntt technocross corporation and in  it formed a similar agreement with serverworks co ltd which is a primary vendor to aws in  the company concluded an equity investment agreement with salesforcecom inc of the us in  terrasky co established subsidiary terrasky inc in california and through this subsidiary it started selling its cloud computing services in north america in  terrasky co listed its shares on the mothers market of the tokyo stock exchange in  the company concluded equity investment and business development agreements with ecomott inc which is engaged in the internet of things iot and with cloudia japan inc which provides cloud integration services in kyushu japan also in  the company established subsidiary beex which provides cloud integration services for migrating from a simple cloud computing system to a cloud computing system based on sap inc’s main erp software finally in  the company with win consul inc established subsidiary kitalive inc which also provides cloud integration services in its first fiscal year through february  the company reported sales of ¥mn every year since then its sales have increased reaching ¥mn in fy for fy the company projects sales of ¥mn which would match the high rate of sales growth achieved in fy ◆ japan’s cloud computing market and company’s businesses leading market development as a specialist in cloud computing services  japan’s cloud computing market in the first half of the ’s japanese companies adopted mainframe computers since the ’s mainframe computers have been replaced by desktop office computers and minicomputers in the ’s the computer industry emphasized client servers between  and  cloud computing appeared in japan prompting a paradigm shift in japan’s it industry dominated by companies and platforms such as salesforce amazon web services google and microsoft azure with the spread of cloud computing it applications have entered an era in which usage is more important than ownership the cloud is a platform that allows the offering of software and data through a network as a service rather than as components of a computer system a user of the cloud for computing does not need to buy hardware software and data and the construction and maintenance of a cloud computing system requires less time and effort than the construction and maintenance of an onpremises computer system thus the use of cloud computing lowers costs and improves work efficiency cloud computing can be used by companies of any size and in any industry requires no initial investment and can be implemented in a short period of time these large advantages over client server systems have motivated japanese companies to adopt cloud computing according to mm research institute ltd the japanese market for cloud computing services was valued at ¥trn in the government’s fiscal  which ran through march  this institute forecasts that this market will grow to ¥trn by fiscal  or to  times the size of the market in fiscal  for average annual growth of  as many japanese companies still use client server systems there appears to be ample room for terrasky co to expand its business  company’s business segments the company’s two business segments are the solution business and the product business in fy the solution business provided  of the company’s consolidated sales and  of its operating income while the product business accounted for  of consolidated sales and  of preadjusted operating income in fy  of the company’s total consolidated sales were made to facilitate the use of services provided by salesforcecom inc and  were made to facilitate the use of amazon web services aws salesforce com applications thus remained the leading sales driver in fy but they were less dominant than they had been in fy when they accounted for  of total sales while aws applications accounted for only  the company’s sales for salesforcecom applications grew yoy in fy but not by as large a rate as its sales for aws applications  solution business the solution business supports the development of optimal systems using the cloud that satisfy a customer company’s needs the business also develops such systems its three main services are cloud integration cloud consulting and cloud erp to facilitate the introduction or implementation of the front office systems salesforce and aws the solution business undertakes a wide range of services from defining requirements to design development testing operation validation of effectiveness planning improvement policies and systemization planning terrasky co has licensed salesforce products from salesforcecom inc the solution business of terrasky co serves mainly large corporate customers consolidated subsidiary cloudia japan offers consulting services for the introduction of salesforce products to companies in kyushu while consolidated subsidiary kitalive provides similar services to companies in hokkaido equityaccounted affiliate serverworks provides cloud integration services for the introduction of cloud systems mainly aws consolidated subsidiary sky which is owned  by terrasky co and  by serverworks provides msp services for the cloud although many large japanese companies have introduced cloud services many small and medi­umsized companies have not thus cloudia japan and kitalive should be able to introduce cloud services to smaller companies and companies in rural areas of japan furthermore beex is promoting the migration from simple cloud systems to the cloud system based on the many erp systems operated globally by sap inc thus sap’s cloud services may become the next main target of terrasky’s services following the cloud services of salesforce and aws in december  terrasky co became the only japanese company certified as a gold partner for the cloud enterprise application glovia om developed by fujitsu ltd  agencies affiliated with terrasky are now selling glovia om thereby expanding the involvement of terrasky in cloud erp services since the glovia om application is used mainly by smaller companies while sap’s erp services are used mainly by larger companies there should be little competitive overlap between the services terrasky has implemented more than  saleforce applications for companies of all sizes in many industries and with a wide range of capabilities among its clients are the mizuho financial group inc  odakyu electric railway co ltd  group and the world wildlife federation in fy the solution business generated net sales of ¥mn and operating income before adjustments of ¥mn for a segment operating income margin of   product business terrasky is developing and marketing cloud services as a vendor of software as a service saas ie software provided through the internet these services include the screen development services skyvisual editor and supice the data integration services skyondemand and dataspidercloud the socialware service mitoco and the ias service for insurance agencies many companies in japan use these services to adjust aspects of their it systems such as screens and logic in particular the skyvisualeditor service and the skyondemand service have become de facto standards in japan’s it industry terrasky had previously developed products for engineers in charge of developing and maintaining systems but in july  the company released its first socialware groupware service mitoco the japanese government is promoting a revolution in work styles and japanese companies are also introducing flexible work styles such as working at home groupware is a corporate communication tool that is expected to become more important in coming years the mitoco socialware service differs from competing services now used by many companies in that it is based on the cloud current socialware services use database engines that were designed a long time ago when today’s cloud environment was not foreseen thus it is difficult to use these socialware services on smartphones to operate as originally intended these services put great stress on computer systems the mitoco service was developed for use on the cloud and its simple operating system makes it easy to select desired functions as a platform for linking with the applications of other companies it is very expandable for these reasons the mitoco service is easy to use not only for managers of computer systems but also for general company employees in cooperation with ecomott inc a maker of it devices terrasky has developed a sensor that enables the mitoco service to detect the usage of conference rooms and an iot option service for functions such as managing vehicles sometimes conference rooms are reserved but are not in use during the reserved time the conference room sensor automatically sends a message to the person who has reserved the unused room and if that person does not respond soon the sensor can automatically cancel the reservation allowing others to use the room similarly the vehicle management service promotes the efficient use of vehicles by matching reservations with actual use the drive recorder incorporated in this service allows vehicle managers to monitor the operation of vehicles any mechanical problems they may encounter the mitoco service has already been adopted by sompo systems inc tokio marine  nichido fire insurance co ltd nikkei inc and other companies and the company anticipates an increase in orders for the service the name mitoco was derived from the englishlanguage expression “more in today’s company” the product business is conducted by terrasky co and terrasky inc ntt software with which terrasky holds an equity investment and business alliance is a general sales agent for the sale of the skyondemand service in japan but terrasky inc handles all product sales in north america in fy the product business generated sales of ¥mn and operating income of ¥mn for a high segment operating income margin of   strengths terrasky co has three main strengths the first is vast experience as of march  the company had imple­mented more than  cloud computing services for companies of varying size capability and industry with this much experience the company has acquired substantial knowhow in cloud integration including knowledge of project management and product quality control it is one of a few japanese companies that can undertake large cloud integration projects and it appears to be the most competitive of this small group for the past  years the magazine nikkei computer has ranked companies providing cloud services in japan for the past six years terrasky co has been selected as one of the leading suppliers of assistance for the implementation of cloud services in the public sector the second strength of terrasky co is the number and quality of its engineers which are unmatched in japan’s cloud integration industry the number of certifications or awards won by the company’s engineers attests to their high quality salesforcecom has presented mvp awards to only five engineers in japan and two of those five work for terrasky co there are only nine certified technical architects in japan and three of them work for terrasky the company employs the largest number of certified advanced platform developers platform application builders advanced administrators platform developers salescloud consultants and servicecloud consultants in japan it also employs many engineers who are certified by aws including certified solutions architect professionals devops engineer professionals developers and sysops administrators the company encourages its engineers to improve their technical skills pays competitive salaries and controls working hours thus it attracts highquality engineers and its engineer retention rate is high compared with the average retention rate in the industry terrasky’s third strength is its ability to serve more than one platform salesforce has the greatest need for cloud integration services so it is terrasky’s top priority service while aws is the second one reason that companies buy the cloud service provided by salesforce and aws is that these companies have enough engineers to provide the services in greatest demand these companies hold top shares of the global markets for platforms as a service paas and infrastructure as a service iaas and in recent years the sales of salesforce have grown at an average annual rate of  while the sales of aws have risen at an average annual rate of  these sales growth rates indicate that terrasky’s orders from these companies are likely to grow by similar rates fisco believes that the company’s greatest strength is the cyclical reinforcement of the three strengths cited above in other words by completing many projects the company and its engineers gained substantial knowhow and valuable experience which extended the company’s superiority in the japanese market for cloud services making it easy to acquire new projects  business risks the company will have to hire and retain enough engineers to expand its business although there is a labor shortage in japan and hiring is very competitive it appears that the company can obtain personnel more easily as it grows in scale and its reputation spreads regardless of whether it can hire as many engineers as it wants hiring appears to be getting easier for the company than it used to be the company is trying to improve its working environment and to build a workplace where ambitions technicians can continue to pursue attractive projects aggressively a longterm business risk is that the company may react to the next great paradigm shift in japan’s rapidly changing it industry too slowly it is president sato’s top priority to insure that the company remains alert to potential paradigm shifts ◆ mediumterm plan targeting a consolidated ordinary income of ¥bn in fy the company’s mediumterm plan addresses management issues that appeared in the second year after listing its shares it calls for investing heavily in human resources and in developing services in artificial intelligence the internet of things and enterprise resource planning on the cloud platform to better serve japan’s rapidly growing market for cloud services as a result of implementing this strategy the company intends to earn a consolidated ordinary income of ¥bn in fy however the plan has two phases in the first phase from fy through fy the company will invest significantly while maintaining rapid sales growth in the second phase from fy through fy profit growth will be given greater emphasis in the first phase while selling more products ai products and iot products mainly for salesforce the company will hire and train more engineers develop new products expedite ma and plant the seeds to cope with future competition in the second phase the company plans to take advantage of its number one position in japan’s cloud integration industry to improve its profits and profitability the company may also start paying dividends in fy if it achieves its profit forecasts in order to achieve its targets the company is aware that it must do four things raise project profitability increase the sales weighting of the product business ensure an adequate supply of engineers and generate synergy among the companies in its group ◆ results trends phase of investment priority  fy results in fy the company’s consolidated net sales climbed  yoy to ¥mn while its operating income declined  to ¥mn its ordinary income decreased  to ¥mn and its net income attributable to owners of the parent fell  to ¥mn in the solution business sales growth reflected brisk orders for the construction of cloud systems and the aggregate number of cloud services such as salesforce implemented by the company exceeded  in addition sales growth was led by an increase in the number of users of the company’s products the initial consolidation of cloudiajapan inc and two other subsidiaries also contributed to sales growth several factors contributed to the declines in profits advertising and promotion costs increased as a result of marketing the new mitoco socialware service the number of manhours of labor and the outsourcing cost increased as some special development projects took longer to complete than had been scheduled the company sped up the hiring of employees mainly engineers and some of its consolidated subsidiaries suffered losses however only one of the company’s projects suffered a loss of ¥mn in fy down from  lossmaking projects with losses totaling ¥mn in fy this decline resulted from improved project management including more detailed information about project proposals and assistance to financially struggling projects the company’s operating income margin dropped to  in fy from  in fy but this was due to the increased investment by the company and was within the range of management’s expectations the company’s roe was  in fy and its ratio of ordinary income to total assets was   business segments in the solution business sales grew  yoy to ¥mn but segment profit operating income before adjustments weakened by  to ¥mn the business received more orders for large projects ie projects worth more than ¥mn each than it had in fy and it improved more previously installed systems and services leading to the sales rise segment profit declined because the business hired more engineers and its outsourcing costs increased furthermore the business aggressively pursued some projects linked to large systems and some that required new technology and these projects took longer to develop than originally planned in the product business sales grew  yoy to ¥mn and segment profit increased  to ¥mn an expansion of the japanese market for salesforce products supported the sales increase segment profit increased at a smaller rate than sales because advertising and promotion costs grew as a result of marketing the new mitoco socialware service and because the business hired more personnel  consolidated subsidiaries fy marked a turnaround in the contributions of consolidated subsidiaries to sales and profits in the final quarter of fy two consolidated subsidiaries contributed total sales of ¥mn with the consolidation of beex inc in the first quarter of fy total sales from consolidated subsidiaries rose to ¥mn in the first quarter and mn in the second quarter with the consolidation of cloudiajapan inc in the third quarter of fy sales from all consolidated subsidiaries reached ¥mn that quarter the consolidation of kitalive inc in the fourth quarter helped total sales from consolidated subsidiaries reach ¥mn that quarter consolidated subsidiaries suffered an operating loss of ¥mn in the first quarter of fy but in the following three quarters they reported aggregate operating income of ¥mn ¥mn and ¥mn respectively  financial position and cash flows at the end of fy the company’s assets totaled ¥mn which was ¥mn more than the total a year earlier current assets increased by ¥mn yoy in fy and noncurrent assets grew by ¥mn among current assets cash and deposits increased as did trade notes and accounts receivable goodwill increased by ¥mn and other intangible assets expanded by ¥mn yoy in fy led by a ¥mn increase in software accompanying the development of the mitoco socialware service investments and other assets grew by ¥mn due mainly to a rise in guarantee deposits for new facilities total liabilities increased by ¥mn yoy in fy to ¥mn as current liabilities declined by ¥mn and noncurrent liabilities grew by ¥mn interestbearing debt increased by ¥mn yoy to ¥mn reflecting a large increase in longterm debt which more than offset a small decrease in shortterm debt net assets increased by ¥mn to ¥mn due to the inclusion of fy’s net income attributable to owners of parent to retained earnings and to the sale by serverworks of some of its shareholdings in terrasky co the company issued ¥mn of subscription rights to shares and noncontrolling interests increased to ¥mn accompanying ma activity during fy the equity ratio decreased by  percentage points in fy to  but this was still higher than the average equity ratio for listed japanese companies of  indicating financial strength the balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fy came to ¥mn which was ¥mn more than the balance at the end of fy operating cash flow was negative by ¥mn as a result of several factors income before income taxes was ¥mn and depreciation reached ¥mn but notes and accounts receivable  trade increased by ¥mn income taxes paid amounted to ¥mn and prepaid expenses grew by ¥mn investment cash flow was negative by ¥mn mainly because ¥mn for purchase of intangible assets accompanying investment in software development financial cash flow was positive by ¥mn as the company gained ¥mn from proceeds from longterm loans payable more than offsetting a ¥mn decrease in shortterm loans payable and ¥mn repayments of longterm loans payable  company forecast for fy for fy the company projects a  yoy rise in consolidated net sales to ¥mn a  increase in operating income to ¥mn a  upturn in ordinary income to ¥mn and a  improvement in net income attributable to owners of parent to ¥mn management expects sales in the solution business to grow  yoy to ¥mn and sales in the product business to advance  to ¥mn solution business sales are seen increasing by a smaller rate in fy than they did in fy because sales were boosted in fy by the initial consolidation of three subsidiaries whereas the company does not plan any initial consolidations of subsidiaries for fy the company expects the mitoco socialware service launched in fy to contribute substantially to sales growth in the product business in fy sales generated by consolidated subsidiaries in fy are projected to more than double their sales in fy and these subsidiaries are expected to contribute an aggregate ordinary income of several tens of million yen the company intends to expand its workforce to  persons in fy from  in fy ◆ share supplydemand balance individual shareholders hold more than  of shares outstanding at the end of february  financial institutions held  of all of terrasky’s outstanding shares operators of financial instruments businesses held  other japanese companies held  nonjapanese companies held  and individuals and other shareholders held  at the end of august  company president hideya sato was the top shareholder with  business partner ntt software was second with  and equityaccounted affiliate serverworks was third with  although the company has outstanding rights for the subscription to new shares fisco calculates that the maxi­mum possible dilution of eps from the exercise of these rights
