of the leading european it ecommerce service providers bechtle ag based in germany operates in  locations and serves over  customers the company provides onestop shopping for it infrastructure needs with more than  products in stock and  new products added every week managing such high volumes requires a finetuned logistics process to assure quick delivery times and excellent customer service the challenge it became apparent at the head office of bechtle ag in neckarsulm that the existing infrastructure wouldn’t be able to keep up with the growing volumes the company’s rapid expansion in a short time period posed a logistics problem the timeconsuming paperwork processes used for stock removal consignment and supply were no longer appropriate to keep pace with growth bechtle ag was going to have to consider reengineering its logistics process the company decided that in order to boost its capacity and turnover rate in the future a warehouse management system needed to be implemented the solution bechtle ag took the initiative and acted right away the stock area was enlarged to  sqm and a new storage area management system and internal transport method was implemented along with the falcon™ x mobile computer for data capture datalogic’s falcon x mobile computers are connected to the system via its mobile for radio data transmission providing a permanent exchange of data and information between the system and employees in this manner an overview of all the processes is always present in real time falcon x mobile computers are used at several points in the order process when employees register their names and passwords they are informed of all the orders that need to be prepared in their respective areas if several articles are included in an order the falcon x mobile computer displays each position and determines the optimal picking route the operator accepts each article on the list and starts the picking process with supply verification and inventory carried out automatically the results “an average of  parcels leave the distribution center daily” points out klaus kratz project director bechtle ag “this number will surely grow in the future and thanks to this updated system using the falcon x mobile computer coupled with the integration of a larger warehouse and a fully automated conveyor belt crossing over the entire area we are ready to handle the larger volumes” the falcon x mobile computer contributes to this successful new system in many ways it speeds up operations with automatic inspections and safe paperless order processing the qvga display with background lighting provides effortless reading both in very bright outdoor areas and in darker surroundings the terminal is robust resisting drops of  meters to concrete with an ip protection class that safeguards it from dust and water contamination plus the patented green spot technology confirms every scan with a green spot for visual good read feedback fundamental in noisy environments the falcon x mobile computer also includes preinstalled and prelicensed wavelink® avalanche® software making device setup fast and simple bechtle considers this feature fundamental for assuring increased efficiency in the warehouse “thanks to the preinstalled and prelicensed wavelink avalanche software the falcon x mobile computers can be configured by simply scanning a few barcodes making a brandnew device ready for use in less than  minutes” comments florian zahn networkengineer of the internal it department of bechtle ag “deployment is quick allowing operators to start working right away” this overhaul of the logistics department in neckarsulm has launched bechtle ag towards future expansion and growth complex manual operations have given way to streamlined fast and safe processes inventory counts are now always uptodate the falcon x mobile computer handles all the incoming goods outgoing goods consignment or the supply of merchandise in the picking area increasing efficiency and performance rates “with the implementation of the new logistics strategy we have created a vision for our future growth with a goal of reaching a five billion euro turnover and  employees in ” indicated klaus kratz project director bechtle ag “we made a successful change from the old analog to the new digital world”   client bechtle agindustrysubindustry
