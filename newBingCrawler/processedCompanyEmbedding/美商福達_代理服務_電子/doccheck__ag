are no known operational or rendering problems concerning the appliedfor gtld string if such issues are known describe steps that will be taken to mitigate these issues in software and other applications doccheck ag has carefully examined the appliedfor string including sword test and found that deployment of it would not cause adverse operational rendering or general userconfusion due to visual similarity with existing tlds iso lists icann list of reserved names or lists of ineligible strings it is safe to assume similar to existing asciionly tld strings like com net or de that no operational or rendering problems will occur the string “med” consists entirely of ascii letters that are already used for existing top level domains all the characters in the name are even used in the leftmost position of existing tld labels it constitutes a valid host name having at least three and less than  characters the ascii label is therefore in compliance with the string requirements set forth in the applicant guidebook applicant guidebookpage  section  “string requirements”and with all technical standards such as but not limited to rfc  rfc  rfc  rfc  and rfc  since the registry does not support righttoleft scripts on the second level bidirectional issues like the ones described at http⁄⁄stupiddomainname⁄node⁄ will not occur moreover the gtld string exclusively uses characters from a single alphabet does not contain digits or hyphens and contains characters that are not subject to homograph issues in total there is no potential for confusion with regard to the rendering of other tld strings however doccheck ag is aware of its responsibility to mitigate and resolve possible issues as discussed inter alia during the ʺtld universal acceptanceʺ session at the costa rica icann meeting on  march  http⁄⁄costaricaicannorg⁄meetings⁄sanjose⁄presentationtlduniversalacceptancemarenpdf validity checks of tlds based on hardcoded lists which may not be updated with all new gtlds or length checks ie maximum of characters based on wrong definitions or outdated lists of tlds some applications may not convert new gtlds to links some websites or applications may regard email addresses or urls entered by users as invalid if they contain a new gtld with the effect of eg refusing registration email clients validating addresses on the length of tlds by applying an outdated list of tlds may cause problems as valid email addresses may not be accepted websites and search engines eg google and bing may refuse to offer services such as advertising if they validate email addresses and domain names based on outdated definitions of tlds or simply refuse to add new gtlds to their lists mobile browsers may not be updating their lists of valid tlds as live dns lookups may be considered costly or inadequate by the providers doccheck ag will work towards enabling general global acceptance of new gtlds by consulting with registry operators service providers and software developers to ensure and encourage a quick adoption of new gtlds  optional provide a representation of the label according to the international phonetic alphabet httpwwwlangsciuclacukipa missionpurpose a describe the missionpurpose of your proposed gtld list of contenta overall mission and purposeb target groupc beneficiariesd forecasted demande beyond mission and purposea overall mission and purposethe mission of the proposed gtld med is to provide a safe and secure selfcontaining namespace for the medical community and thus addressing the interests of skilled trustworthy and verified members of the medical professions ordinary people seeking information regarding medical and healthcare topics will benefit from medwebsites as reliable sources of informationfrom this mission statement to different groups can be deduced on the one hand individuals and organizations from the medical professions being considered as potential registrants this group is labeled “target group” on the other hand is the group called “beneficiaries” representing the audience of users that is appealed to such a new gtld both groups are delineated as followsb target groupas described in the overall mission the target group that we are aiming to engage with consists of skilled trustworthy and verified members of the medical professions skilled and trustworthy in this context means that an individual qualifies as a member of the target group only when it can provide proof of formal or longstanding training and⁄or experience in any field of medicine this field can be human medicine as well as veterinary medicine and can be related to academic or alternative medicine verified means that the individual has delivered such proof and that the proof has been accepted as sufficientonly after successful verification an individual will be considered a member of the medical community and will be granted access to the registration of a domain under the new gtld medthe typical professions and organizations that fall into the target group are listed in the following six groups medicalphysician dentist ergo therapist hospital doctor´s office psychologist psychotherapist physiotherapist optician ⁄ optometrist dietician speech therapist chiropractic orthotics podiatrist psychomotor therapist hearing aid acoustician veterinary toxicologist other medical professions scientifictechnical biologist biochemist chemist laboratories medical physicist medical laboratory scientist mls  physical scientist medical information scientist medical

advertising agency employee publishing company employee insurance company employee pharmaceutical industry employee pharmaceuticalcommercial employee industry employee journalist librarian medical journalist medical photographer ⁄ designer medical documentarist doctorʹs receptionist⁄ assistant pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical whole seller governmental organizations nongovernmental organizationswhen considering the target group different use cases are possible there could be an internist who registers a domain for his doctor’s office addressed to the public to inform about his services or there could be a pharmaceutical company that publishes additional information about its drugs to medical professionals and⁄or the public another use case is a closed discussion forum established by a healthcare professional under a meddomain addressing medical and healthcare topics – open or not open for public presentation on the internet then there could be a whole scientific community consisting of research networks publication databases and representative space all around a verified medical namespace as an elearning platform for medical students is already part of our service proposition today future members of the professional medical community namely university students could establish websites under meddomains to provide learning support to each other or to rate and rank medical education facilitiesin each use case the gtld med would significantly add to the reputation of a website as a medical website orientation for healthcare professionals and the general public on the internet would be much improvedc beneficiariesapart from the community members all other internet users are considered a relevant audience benefiting from the new gtld med as well this is because at one point or another every human being will be concerned with medical and healthcare topics  personally or through relatives and friends although one is typically not constantly concerned with medical topics a source of information becomes even more valuable in case of sickness or an emergency if it can be trusted that is why the gtld med aims at increasing the trustworthiness of the medical content on the internet the gtld med will so add relevant value for people interested in beforementioned topics ie current patients people with temporary illnesses people with chronic diseases professionals and family caretakersagain different use cases are conceivable the first use case is the classic case of an ordinary internet user seeking information on a medical topic typically the person will make use of search engines such as google or bing the search results are usually shown including the full url of each result a result with a med tld will indicate to the user that this result is most likely relevant to his search as this gtld is reserved for healthcare professionals a second use case is a website which is set up by a healthcare professional or a healthcare organization which aims directly at patients such a website could offer services like telemedicine selfservice portals or professionally moderated support groupssimple nonmoderated forums and the like are not a use case for the gtld med if there is no healthcare professional involvedd forecasted demandin order to consider the gtld’s introduction successful doccheck ag expects to operate  “med” domains by the end of year  of registry operations the aggregated forecast on registered “med” domains is therefore as followsyear  year  year  this forecast includes direct sales of domains to accredited registrars but also additional sales by doccheck ag in combination with already existing services the business case in question  “projections template” will further illustrate which revenues are expected from the registry business ie including doccheck ag’s registry activitiese beyond mission and purposeour purpose of hosting the gtld med goes beyond the mere provision of an additional top level domain when introducing a tld for professionals in the field of medicine and health we believe that the respective tld must be safeguarded against any insecure and⁄or fraudulent behaviour therefore d b how proposed gtld will benefit registrants internet users and others list of contenti goal areas of specialty service levels reputationii value add to the current space in terms of competition differentiation innovationiii user experienceiv registration policiesv protecting privacyvi outreach and communicationsi goal areas of specialty service levels reputationareas of specialtythe mission statement and the targeted audience as defined and described in question a strongly indicate the area of specialty the new gtld med is focusing on the overall goal in terms of specialization is to establish and maintain a clearcut focus on topics in the medicine and healthcare category we are fully aware of the fact that a variety of subtopics can be subsumed under this category this is due to the varicolored and diverse shades of professions in this field and the formidable size of the topics themselves consequently we expect to have a gray area of topics that might be only partially covered by the mission statement it will be impossible to find and apply axiomatic rules that can adjudicate on every particular case however the goal has to be to reduce such cases to an absolute and inevitable minimum and at the same time maximize quality for the vast majority of topicsdespite the foreseeable but limited number of controversial registrations we as the registry operator do not generally see our role as content discriminators as we fully commit ourselves to the community approach we would like to establish a grassroots democracy means of community votes in cases of doubt to maintain and uphold the overall mission and the registry agreement such a means would of course have to be completely in line with all dispute resolution processes already established by icann and are additionally subject to discussion with and appraisal of an icann institution please refer to the description of intended registration policies for further detailsservice levelsin terms of service levels that the new gtld med will add we expect two effects to occur at first we believe that with increasing penetration the new gtld will more and more become a quality label added to the second level domains as a matter of fact already today only two aspects of a website can indicate any information to the user about that site before even before visiting it the second level and the top level domain as the second level domain can be defined at the registrant’s discretion it will most likely testify something about the content a user will find on the respective website however this must not always be the case a second level domain can also be composed of imaginary terms or worse fake and obscure words a top level domain such as the proposed string med however cannot be altered by any registrant and will therefore remain the same for all second level domains in the zone in coherence with thorough marketing measures promoting the gtld med as a quality label the internet user can judge the content quality of a website with the help of a joint mission statement registration policies and a code of conduct we believe that the label med will indicate quality security and reliability of information the user will develop a maximum sense of trust towards med websites and therefore be more likely to visit them when being in need for medical and healthcare topics as the element of trust also becomes more and more important for search engine operators such as google or bing this development will also lead to a preferred status of med websites in search results and consequently in a higher rankingreputationthis has several implications for the reputation of registrants and their respective websites on the one hand registrants can now label the first user touchpoint of their website – the domain – with a gtld that symbolizes trustworthiness credibility and accuracy on the other hand internet users are able to identify a valuable website without even visiting it just by the indication of the gtld the interaction of registrants and internet users enabled by a top level domain med is largely oriented towards the similar effects of brands therefore it is fair to say that it can be expected that med will become a brand or signet that websites have to qualify for it will then hold true that if a website is assigned with the signet med it offers trustworthy and reliable information to the internet userii value add to the current space in terms of competition differentiation innovationcompetitionthe introduction of the new gtld med creates a new competitive environment as mentioned before internet users will be able to quickly identify and classify information presented among the namespace of the proposed gtld med the gtld is intended to serve the community as a whole it makes great demands on content types content quality and on the publisher of the website itself it has the ambition to become a label brand or signet which needs registry and registrants pulling together in the same direction to ensure this we believe that the establishment of competition among all registrants applying for a med gtld will add quality to the namespace itself and the internet as a whole which will then again benefit all internet users as the gtld will be on the one hand a sign of quality and reliability for internet users it will on the other hand have positive effects for the respective website owners in terms of rising visits higher publicity and possibly an increase in revenue therefore every med website operator will strive for perfection of content type information quality and service availability by doing so they can make sure to remain eligible for receiving the signet meddifferentiationby introducing the new gtld program registry operators for the first time in internet history are able to offer a top level domain as a quality differentiation criterion differentiation by top level domain name adds value for both the target group described in a and internet users it is commonly known that a product or service offering is in great need for competitive differentiators and unique selling propositions in order to distinguish itself from competitors and therefore be successful website providers with content covering medical and healthcare topics will from then on have the chance to differentiate their offering from others via the unique label med this becomes especially important on the internet for two reasons first the individual internet user independently searches for such information and is usually not capable of judging medical and healthcare content on its quality and reliability second parts of internet have unfortunately become the playground of drug forgers and wheelerdealers at the cost of the patients and internet users therefore the qualitycontrolled environment of a med gtld will avoid all such problems and highlight and differentiate between all website operators that commit to the conceptinnovationagain the new gtld program offers the application of some innovative means and measures at first we consider the differentiation aspects also to be highly innovative because such thoughts have not been possible or applicable before at second we also intend to implement some innovative operation measures that support our overall mission for example we believe that not doccheck ag should be in charge of defining content boundaries but the community itself doccheck ag will establish and maintain a framework of basic general requirements necessary to ensure controlled and wellregulated operations nevertheless this service is carried out for the medical and healthcare community consisting of highlyeducated and homogenous organizations and individuals therefore we intend to integrate the community in decision making processes as much as possible and feasible additionally when considering dispute cases we also think about integrating a third party as dispute resolution provider its task would be assessing the alignment of website content with the requirements raised in the mission statement the registration policies and the code of conduct at third the community itself benefits from the establishment of a new gtld med and can therefore exploit global innovation processes the former regionallyorganized community parts will set out further using synergies existing through the internet and their connector med to expand and strengthen the bands between each other iii user experienceas some aspects that have already been described earlier also enhance user experience they will at first be briefly repeated before focusing on new aspects as mentioned before we expect to help centralizing medical and healthcare topics on the internet and therefore creating a label or brand that offers the user a onestop shop approach towards all facets of such topics accompanying effects will be the effect of higher trust for medlabeled websites the firsttime possibility to evaluate website content quality before even visiting the respective site and the assurance of quality security and reliability of information a new aspect of enhanced user experience concerns the group of medical and healthcare professionals as beneficiaries of the med gtld from experience we know that organizations and individuals belonging to such professions usually follow a very conservative approach towards information policies as they operate in a field where discretion and data security is a crucial part of daily business especially when being in contact with patients this fact is not surprising at all however especially this field is also heavily driven by research activities which relies on information exchange for consensual progressing we believe that the gtld med can play a vital role in connecting professionals and encouraging communication this is due to the fact that professionals will also identify the assured quality reliability and security of information provided and therefore more easily publish their information or engage in discussion forums for example iv registration policiesfirst an applicant for a med second level domain has to apply for a doccheck account this step is necessary and favors almost all goals directly or indirectly for the following reason one of the core competencies of doccheck ag is the verification process for members of the medical and healthcare professions organizations and institutions as well as individuals worldwide as we operate a single signon sso service for more than  years now we have the inhouse knowledge to verify identification documents and classify the relevant professions during this highlyoptimized and therefore rapid process only relevant information is acquired from the registrant and data security is always in compliance with relevant laws and data security regulations therefore outsourcing this activity to a registrar for example would harm the goal of assuring quality security and reliability of information especially as no costs are generated for the registrant this procedure directly supports the goal of maintaining a target group solely consisting of members from the medical and healthcare professions each applicant for a new med second level domain will have to provide proof of being an eligible member of the community please refer to question a for further details on eligible professions and organizations consequently doccheck ag has automatic and in some cases manual verification mechanisms in place as described above this supports the community approach providing a platform for safe and secure information addressed to both beneficiary groups professionals and all internet userssecond applicants will have to obligate themselves to strictly follow a code of conduct coc the coc will consist of a generic and a medical part the generic part covers topics as following second level domain name registration must not infringe upon the rights of others second level domain name registration must not violate trademark or any other rights of others  second level domain name registration must not in any case violate national and international laws neither second level domain name nor content published under it can contain explicit or implicit pornography violence glorification political or religious extremism including but not necessarily limited to fascism islamism etc the registrant has a legitimate interest in the domain name the registrant does not act in bad faith the registrant and all respective activities must abide national and international laws the registrant agrees that in dispute cases the verdict of a third party dispute resolution provider such as a community audit and according to icann’s dispute resolution processes is bindingthe medical part covers topics as following the registrant only publishes content relevant for medical and healthcare topics or indicating a strong connection towards it the registrant provides platforms for usergenerated content only for relevant medical and healthcare topics or indicating a strong connection towards it the registrant verifies all content that is published in his responsibility and thereby ensures quality fulsomeness and correctness in all conscience the registrant agrees that in dispute cases the verdict of a third party dispute resolution provider such as the healthonthenet foundation a community audit and according to icann’s dispute resolution processes is bindingbesides a particular domain name can only be registered if the name has not been registered yet the name is not reserved or blocked the name fulfills the technical and lexical requirementsthird as mentioned before doccheck ag can imagine establishing a socalled community audit as a dispute resolution process in this case individual dispute cases would not be ruled by doccheck ag but by the democratic vote of the whole community this would ensure that every case receives fair and equal treatment and disengage doccheck ag from a content discriminator additionally such a solution would strengthen the connection inherent in the community we suppose that this thought is new to icann and are fully aware that it has to withstand an icann appraisal nevertheless we believe it is a relevant means for our community applicationfourth the applicant has to agree that a violation against any of the policies of the registration agreement may result in the loss of the registered domain fifth doccheck ag will act upon request or complaint on the basis of the registration policies moreover the answers provided to questions  “registration lifecycle”  “abuse prevention and mitigation” and  “rights protection mechanisms” describe more clearly in which cases doccheck will proactively agitate in means of supporting the goals listed abovev protecting privacyregarding measures of privacy and⁄or confidential information protection we intend to adhere to all standards already set by other registriesvi outreach and communicationsdoccheck ag has a great interest in transforming the project into a community success first and foremost we hope that our ambitious goals can be reached and the community members accept this revolutionary approach towards topic clustering and trust on the internet therefore we plan to carry out several marketing activities from experience we are aware of the fact that our target group is riskaverse and conservative towards marketing activities we know that a reliable transparent and consistent communication strategy over a long period of time is necessary in order to activate earlyadopters and multipliers therefore we plan to create an explanation of advantages of this project and carry out a steadilytimed communication plan as a provider of various eservices for the medical community ie a daily newsletter with more than  recipients we have a multitude of direct marketing means at hand to instantly start with market communication as we already have business relations to almost all relevant medical and healthcare portals around the globe we plan to carry out banner campaigns with partner websites solely for this purpose we will establish a microsite or a website part integrated in our platform as landing page thereby we hope to provide suitable information directly to the target group furthermore we take an active part at fairs conferences and conventions and are thinking of presenting the med topic to a broad audience c describe operating rules to eliminate or minimize social costs or financial resource costs various types of consumer vulnerabilities list of contenti multiple applications for one particular domain nameii cost benefits for registrantsiii magnitude of price escalationsi multiple applications for one particular domain nameone operating rule to eliminate social costs has been to assign domains on a firstcome firstserve basis if there are multiple applications for one particular domain name the reason is that doccheck ag introduces “med” gtld in order to benefit interested parties especially with healthcare background this way all relevant parties should be granted with the opportunity to register their preferred domain nameotherwise by choosing to resolve multiple applications for a domain by conducting an auction potentially only privileged registrants would be provided with their preferred domain name as doccheck ag intends to avoid such a situation a decision has been made in favour of a firstcome firstserve allocationii cost benefits for registrantsmoreover doccheck ag commits itself to follow a pricing policy that sets reasonable prices balancing prices on behalf of the registrants as members of the community but to be able to finance registry services albeit the prices will be based on the registry business in which doccheck only has little control of the prices registrars are passing on to the registrantsonly during the time of the execution of the landrush phase domains will be sold in auction modus this method ensures that the most attractive second level domains will go to those parties that are most committed to making the domain a successiii magnitude of price escalationshaving to do with price increases doccheck ag cannot make any binding commitment today that no price increases will occur over the following ten years while running the registry services for the gtld med nevertheless doccheck ag will only increase prices if necessary to follow economic or currency developments that necessitate price changes they will not occur in order to maximize profit however if price increases occur doccheck ag will inform all registrars as well as icann following the registry agreement requiring written notice in advance of price increases communitybased designation  is the application for a communitybased tld yes a provide the name and full description of the community that the applicant is committing to serve aclassification with this application doccheck ag is applying for and committing to serve the medical and healthcare community it consists of both medical and healthcare organizations and individuals worldwide a detailed definition is given for the target group definition in question a for all profession categories listed hereafter both organizations providing such services and individuals filling such positions may be treated equally as domain registrants following is a list of the six profession categories that doccheck ag primarily considers to form the community medical scientifictechnical nursing⁄assisting pharmacy collegiate and business⁄publishing for a detailed description of the professions included in all named subgroups please refer to question a finally also other individuals with a verifiable root in the beforementioned professions may be targeted such as employees of laboratories concluding it should be noted that the list of profession categories given above is not regarded as a criterion for exclusion consequently any group of medical professionals dedicated to the medical and healthcare system and hence being verified through an accredited concession is considered an eligible registrant as long as all regulations of the registration agreement are met this covers individuals organizations of people public and private institutions and resources delivering health care services to meet the health needs of the population b delineation there are several delimitable factors that delineate community members from internet users in general at first the membership and therefore the belonging to the medical and healthcare community is directly dependent on one’s belonging to the medical and healthcare professions as an organization or individual access to such professions is most likely limited and controlled by governmental organizations or similar institutions like cooperatives one does only get access granted if one can prove to the described organizations when fulfilling several criteria an individual should have successfully completed a scientific or professional education program an organization should be able to meet predefined criteria in its corporate practice this usually involves the receipt of some kind of certificate or award by the individual or the organization after successful completion of an educational track or the receipt of a license or concession in almost all cases an automatic acceptance and integration into the community is granted therefore it can be said that the membership of the community is restricted and not open to the public or all internet users as said before the community membership not only binds a member to a certain profession but also predefines the industry one is engaged in for the medical and healthcare community the relevant industries are obviously medical services pharmaceutics biological⁄chemical⁄physical technologies and related services please refer to the definition of professions in question a for details at last also language differences can be determined when looking into the medical and healthcare community especially those professions have developed a complex system of technical terms and phrases that an ordinary person can hardly understand ie their own dictionaries such as the pschyrembel clinical dictionary for germanspeaking countries or the stedmanʹs medical dictionary for englishspeaking countries c structure although the global medical and healthcare community clearly fulfills all criteria that define a community a single and overarching constituent part does not yet exist every comparable community part such as international umbrella organizations faces some restrictions that disqualify said organization to act as the constituent part of the community that is for example because only a single occupation or a special area of the medical and healthcare community are represented even worse most organizations are intentionally limited to national coverage in almost every country a multitude of organizations and associations exists each being divided by professions and in most cases even by specialty of the profession all forming an independent entity additionally the medical community is subdivided by subjectspecific administrative and⁄or policymotivated groups these organizations are normally characterized by long decisionmaking cycles and widely ramified hierarchy in its structures as well as operations even though there are cooperation tendencies between such organizations and associations visible defining them as constituent parts would exaggerate the cause nevertheless a community like this should sooner or later establish an adhesive force that guarantees an overall communication and organization network the doccheck service with its more than  members today could be considered to be a first step in this direction hence doccheck ag is aiming at representing the interests of all organizations and individuals belonging to medical and healthcare professions no matter of their exact occupation or origin in order to encourage crossprofessional collaboration d establishment and history the establishment of the community was a process in flux throughout history and dates back several millenniums the roots of the medical and healthcare community go as far back in the past as to the egyptian high culture and the civilization of ancient greece when the guilds of healers were evolving therefore it can be considered being one of the oldest communities worldwide since even a brief historical summary of the activities in the medical and healthcare community over time would exceed the scope of this application only some of the most important milestones will be provided  the hippocratic oath requires a new physician to swear upon a number of healing gods that he will uphold a number of professional ethical standards  in the middle ages mostly monks practiced medical knowledge and by doing this in monasteries the first hospitals were established the first pharmacy opened in london in   at the beginning of modernity as science and technology developed medicine became more reliant upon medications also pharmacology was becoming increasingly sophisticated  most of the organizations and associations have been established after the world war ii respectively the world health organization in  and the world medical association in   contemporary medicine conducted within healthcare systems legal credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments augmented on occasion by international organizations the characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided  current trends in this field include telemedicine and a new form of interdisciplinary collaboration of patients and treating doctors on the basis of innovate communication technology like doccheck network e size with regards to the size of the community to geographic extent and membership the official statistics of the who have been taken into account on the basis of several subsequently explained assumptions the exact size has been identified the geographic extent relies on the assumptions laid out in question d therefore the relevant set of countries represented in the community consists of all countries in the world apart from china and japan accordingly the who states that there are roundabout  million http⁄⁄wwwwhoint⁄whr⁄⁄annex⁄annexenpdf socalled “health workers” on the globe as china and japan are deducted the figure accumulates to roundabout  million it should be noticed that this is a conservative estimate as the base applies aless comprehensive target group definition and excludes all national and international medical and healthcare organizations b explain the applicants relationship to the community identified in a list of content a relations to constituent community organizations b accountability a relations to constituent community organizations it has been stated in the answer to question a that until today the medical and healthcare community lacks a single and overarching international umbrella organization even though there are organizations with a global claim none of them comes close to even covering the majority of the multitude of organizations for over  years now doccheck ag is building and providing a platform which could among many other things work as a crossorganizational platform for operations and interest representation for all community members already today the services combined at the doccheck portal are designed for and represent the collectivity of all medical and healthcare professions with more than  active members today the critical mass has already been reached furthermore the doccheck portal is the only community service worldwide that is offered in six different languages including english spanish german french italian and dutch it is currently worked on a project to provide even more languages in order to better support members from eastern europe africa and asia this strongly demonstrates the international approach doccheck is taking towards its service for the international community members even with the languages supported today the americas europe parts of africa and australia are provided with services in the respective mother tongue furthermore doccheck ag and its respective doccheck portal services are deeply rooted professional groups of medical experts the founder and chief executive officer dr med frank antwerpes being a physician himself and his partners themselves are rooted in the community because of their original occupation they possess a deep understanding for the necessities and requirements the community bears after  years of continuous development improvement and implementation of new services and features the doccheck portal is in a transition phase towards new strategic community goals through the application for the new gtld med doccheck can gain responsibilities for providing leadership on global health matters shaping the health research agenda setting norms and standards articulating evidencebased policy options and monitoring and assessing health trends in the st century health is a shared responsibility involving equitable access to essential care and collective defense against transnational threats transparency of information is another factor that is important for the community access to information on conditions treatments quality and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients and therefore the incentives of medical professionals accordingly the community acts as communications platform for healthcare professionals as well as a trustworthy information source for internet users doccheck ag is in good terms with a multitude of community organizations and of course with representatives of such organizations as well many of those representatives and members are doccheck members and contribute to and communicate with the community via the portal they oftentimes take active part in community discussions and the great variety of possibility to generate and conserve content information and knowledge doccheck ag is engaging in activities to nourish and strengthen those bonds and relationships for example by establishing personal contacts and relationships with important representatives groups institutions and organizations this means for example that leaders of such organizations and the clevel of doccheck ag support each other at management tasks give speeches and presentations at organizational meetings and conferences or exchange insights about community and professionrelated purposes doccheckʹs singlesignon sso one of the core features of the portal is used by more than  healthcare professionals worldwide hundreds of physicians pharmacists nurses and medical students actively contribute medical articles and other medical content on the other hand more than  websites of medical organizations eg the apb  belgian pharmacists association and healthcare companies eg pfizer jj novartis provide the doccheck login as an access solution to their respective users medical publishers like wolters kluver de gruyter elsevier or the peopleʹs medical publishing house of china work closely together with doccheck in order to provide the medical community with ebooks and the like a great many of hospitals in europe eg charité berlin university hospital bonn feed medical doctors and students with medical videos and other educational material via doccheck medical fairs eg the worldʹs largest medical fair medica address their visitors through doccheck though doccheck is heavily engaged in the medical community it is important to point out that doccheck is not affiliated with a specific medical association or industry but is open to every medical professional at no cost besides the extensive networking activities it should still be noted that doccheck ag is politically and societally independent doccheck ag itself is not member of any organization association or interest group in the medical and healthcare sector and is therefore not subject to directives of any entity or individual but itself furthermore doccheck ag being incorporation is financially completely independent and does only rely on corporate equity of its stocks in free float and of only two major shareholders with more than  share both in the founding family therefore doccheck ag is very much unlikely to show tendencies of preferential treatment towards a certain individual group organization or association part of the community b accountability because of today’s size of doccheck ag and the doccheck portal and services doccheck ag is fully aware of its accountability towards the medical community a large group of individuals and organizations rely on the services and functions provided at the portal the added value of the information supplied and demanded on a daily basis the content that is generated and shared the knowledge that is developed and multiplied and the contacts and conversations that are made every single day constitute a vital part of the professional life of a not negligible part of the community by applying for med doccheck ag is fully aware of the fact that another even greater part of the portal and service to the community will be added to the portfolio nevertheless doccheck ag is dedicated to provide such services and develop the community and its organization even further c provide a description of the communitybased purpose of the appliedfor gtld list of content a introduction b intended registrants c intended endusers d related activities e lasting nature a introduction the communitybased purpose of the applied for gtld med is to provide a namespace acting as the safe and secure home base for all topics relevant to the medical and healthcare community community members should consider the med as a cooperation of reliable skilled trustworthy and most notably verified professionals sharing similar occupations and a professional attitude towards their work life the gtld should encourage the community and its members to play an active role in the exchange of information and knowledge and the organization of community issues ideally this strengthens the bonds between the sole member and the higher goals and interests that aid and promote the community therefore through centralizing und professionalizing the presentation of medical and healthcare websites services individuals and organizations an identity is created that community members can feel gravitated towards above all the med gtld encourages and improves the provision of a solution accessible for every internet user worldwide in terms of being provided with information and services on medical and healthcare topics that is especially relevant since advanced industrial countries are marked by the impact of an aging society while developing as well as undeveloped countries are marked by population growth linked with a lack of basic medical and healthcare services among others one challenge for the community arises to generate a global communications platform in order to exchange information and professional expertise in medical and healthcare topics b intended registrants consecutively intended registrants for the gtld med are all community members please find an overview on intended registrant categories explained at question a and a detailed compilation of possible professions subsumed under all six registrant categories defined at question a henceforth it should be outlined what possible use cases intended registrants of the gtld could inherit first med should provide a namespace for all members of the medical and healthcare community for representing themselves their businesses or occupations and their daytoday work possible webpages could range from among others introductions of doctor’s practices or hospitals procedures that they are specialized at ie radiology or other information that is worth being published to an open or limited public second community members could for example publish contributions to the development of their fields of expertise or suggestions for treatments diseases etc third they should be able to use the med namespace themselves for research and aggregation of useful information they can apply to their daily work or their field of expertise in general last the secured namespace should encourage experts and practitioners to engage in communication and exchange of information as access to such websites and services with med domain is restricted and therefore a certain level of quality is guaranteed it is expected that community members will experience as greater tendency to do so than today c intended endusers apart from the community members who are intended registrants as well as beneficiaries doccheck ag expects all internet users to be another important group of important beneficiaries thus end users of the gtld med will be all community members as well as all internet users please refer to question a for more details as enduser use cases have already been described for community members in the intended registrant section it should now be concentrated on enduser use cases for internet users first ordinary meaning not directly related to the medical or healthcare profession internet users are able to identify and evaluate the great variety of different medical and healthcare professions and their respective locations with practices hospitals and others they can plan consultations ahead and inform themselves about special circumstances second there is a growing tendency of people demanding information and knowledge about their diseases treatments and methodologies people connected to the internet widely use it as a source for information and research which is why a designated medical and healthcare namespace could function as a first point of contact and signpost for people inexperienced with medical and healthcare topics third webpages and services could complement the doctorpatientrelationship by providing additional information and simplifying communication d related activities apart from the application for the new gtld med doccheck ag is providing a multitude of other services for the medical and healthcare community for over  years now almost all services are provided free of charge as complemental benefits for the free doccheck portal membership the magnitude of services provided are widely accepted and used throughout the medical and healthcare community and deliver added value to all members  doccheck singlesignon providing one login for over  websites with content solely addressed to medical and healthcare professions  doccheck newsletter addressing healthcare specialists worldwide  doccheck faces the medical network service enabling communication among health care specialists  doccheck flexikon an open medical lexicon which is updated and maintained by qualified users of the doccheck portal  doccheck tv doccheck picture doccheck shop  ask a colleague  likewise doccheck campus offers space on the internet for medical students to find information concerning their studies and⁄or opportunities as well as elearning offerings the introduction of the gtld med would establish further space on the internet to broaden that user experience and help young talent to enter the healthcare sector and ordinary people as well as health care specialist to find a reliable information platform empowerment training concerning students e lasting nature as described earlier in the answers to these questions and question  the doccheck network could be understood as a first step towards a crossprofessional medical and healthcare umbrella association providing organizational and communicational as well as other services to the global community this is especially important as it should be obvious that the community will in all probability remain intact as long as humanity lives for different reasons as medical research develops further and further pathogens and germs will mutate and develop as well this is why mankind will have to deal with diseases for a very long time in the future and is therefore always dependable on specialist in the medical and healthcare profession in this argument it is implicitly said that the state of research and therefore treatment methodologies will always develop and experience change and actualization additionally two demographic trends intensify the argument in industrialized countries aging societies and the demographic shift place new challenges on modern public healthcare systems in developing countries population growth and simultaneous lack of basic medical healthcare lead to a high children mortality rates a spread of diseases and epidemic plagues as well as twoclass system of healthcare division between the poor and the rich furthermore even global population is growing and has for the first time ever reached the level of  bn it can be said that trained medical and healthcare personnel is unevenly distributed throughout the world this leads to flashpoints where currently only some organizations like médecins sans frontières doctors without borders deliver basic help all these cases show that the community itself and the supporting goals and causes are needed more than ever on the globe d explain the relationship between the appliedfor gtld string and the community identified in a list of content a name b identification of members c other connotations a name before deciding to apply for the new gtld program doccheck ag entered an extensive name searching process that will suit best the community’s identity and necessities the resulting string med was found to possess the greatest intersecting set of commonalities between the string itself the community name and the community identity “med” as a term can be seen as an abbreviation of medicine medic or medicament this relationship does not only exist in the english language but also in over  other languages worldwide among others in spanish medicina médico or medicamento portuguese medicina medico or medicamento german medizin mediziner or medikament or french médecine médecin or medicament similar examples can be found in almost all other romance and germanic languages which accumulate to  bn native speakers and  bn including nonnative speakers in all these languages the abbreviation med will because of its word stem automatically evoke a connection to medical and healthcare topics but not only to community members but to every speaker of such languages this is also an explanation for the geographic layout of the community given in the answer to question a additionally english as one of the germanic languages is the most widespread language used in medical and healthcare professions the title of a physician in germany for example is delineated “dr med” an equivalent to the us title md doctor of medicine as the gtld string is the word stem for all terms describing medicinal topics also parts of the community name “medical and healthcare” are directly related to the string b identification of members even further most of the profession and occupation names and job titles and descriptions are directly related to the gtld most of the organizations and associations national and international directly or indirectly relate to the abbreviation med by name or mission⁄vision statement a great majority of members of the community would describe their profession as being medicallyrelated it can be said that most people working in such fields perceive themselves as dogooders as their jobs add value for society to a certain extent therefore as community members would automatically identify themselves and their jobs as being related to medicine they will equivalently add such described positive values and attributes to the gtld string itself the abbreviation “med” will act as a messenger c other connotations because of the strong lingual connotation of the string with medical and healthcare topics we could not find any other realistic cases of connotations differing from this case e provide a description of the applicants intended registration policies in support of the communitybased purpose of the appliedfor gtld list of content a eligibility b enforcement c name selection nd level d content ⁄ use in order to ensure that the communitybased purpose set in this document will be achieved after golive doccheck ag will establish registration policies that determine the conditions to which registrant can register a domain consecutively the intended registration policies as well as the appropriate enforcement methods are described please note that some parts may be congruent with parts of the answer to question b for clarification and simplicity reasons it is indicated when parts are adopted from that answer in order to be eligible to register a second level domain name in the med gtld a registrant has to fulfill several requirements  being a verified doccheck user  originating from one of the professions or occupations described in the target group definition in question a and  committing towards the registry agreement and the implied general and medical code of conduct coc a eligibility to  a registrant must successfully apply for a doccheck portal account in order to gain community access some parts may are repeated from the answer to b for clarification reasonsthis process is and will be free of any charge at all times no registration fee or any periodical fee for a doccheck account will ever occur nevertheless this step is absolutely necessary and favors almost all goals directly or indirectly for the following reason one of the core competencies of doccheck ag is the verification process for members of the medical and healthcare professions organizations and institutions as well as individuals worldwide as we operate a single signon sso service for more than  years now we have the inhouse knowledge to verify identification documents and classify the relevant professions during this highlyoptimized and therefore rapid process only relevant information is acquired from the registrant and data security is always in compliance with relevant laws and data security regulations therefore outsourcing this activity to a registrar for example would only harm the goal of assuring quality security and reliability of information especially as no costs will ever occur for the registrant consequently doccheck ag has automatic and in some cases manual verification mechanisms in place as described above this supports the community approach providing a platform for safe and secure information addressed to both beneficiary groups professionals and all internet users to  after describing the verification process it should be delineated which organizations and individuals are eligible for a second level domain in the med tld each applicant for a new med second level domain will have to provide proof of being an eligible member of the community please refer to question a for further details on eligible professions and organizations such proof is usually issued by the government or governmental organizations universities cooperatives and others documents could be for example approbations certificates or diplomas this procedure directly supports the goal of maintaining a target group solely consisting of members from the medical and healthcare professions b enforcement to  doccheck ag plans to implement a coc to the registration policies in order to assimilate registry’s and registrants vision of the namespace delineate the scope of content possibilities and depict consequences in cases of fraudulent behavior of the registrant it is intended to split the coc into two parts one that covers general topics and might not very much differ from regulations in other registry policies and one medical part which covers the particular necessities of the community approach towards the gtld med please refer to the answer to question b for detailed information on the coc for simplicity reasons some of the elements that as well strongly support the community purpose are repeated in this answer the medical part covers topics as following  the registrant only publishes content relevant for medical and healthcare topics or indicating a strong connection towards it  the registrant provides platforms for usergenerated content only relevant medical and healthcare topics or indicating a strong connection towards it  the registrant verifies all content that is published in his responsibility and thereby ensures quality fulsomeness and correctness in all conscience  the registrant agrees that in dispute cases the verdict of a third party dispute resolution provider such as the healthonthenet foundation and according to icann’s dispute resolution processes is binding c name selection nd level according to the possible name selection of the registrant there are several rules as well at first a domain name should in no case infringe upon the rights of others this includes the unrightful registration of domain names that violate trademark rights or other rights of any third party this is especially important in the medical and healthcare sector because of the great variety of companies brands and products at second the second level domain name must follow all standards that icann has set for domain names ie forbiddance of geographic names without consent of the geographic city⁄region⁄country etc at third the chosen second level domain name must demonstrate a clear connection to the name or occupation of the registrant exception from this rule are generic second level domain names such as “diabetes” for example which are awarded in the landrush phase d content ⁄ use as indicated by earlier parts of this answer doccheck ag intends to raise certain conditions regarding the content published on a webpage under a med second level domain for the first time ever it is possible to relate communities to top level domain names which implies some new measures for the selfconcept of the internet as doccheck ag intends a strong connection and dedication of the med to the medical and healthcare community a certain thematic similarity is desirable in order to support the original mission and the community purpose therefore all registrants must commit to only publish relevant content in a sense that medical and healthcare topics are covered or a strong connection towards such topics can be established f attach any written endorsements from institutionsgroups representative of the community identified in a not available geographic names a is the application for a geographic name no protection of geographic names  describe proposed measures for protection of geographic names at the second and other levels in the appliedfor gtld in accordance with specification  doccheck ag will not allow reservation of the following country and territory names at the second and other sublevels the short form in english of all country and territory names contained in the iso  list including all updates made to it the united nations group of experts on geographical names technical reference manual for the standardization of geographical names part iii names of countries in the world the list of united nations member states in  official united nations languages prepared by the working group on country names of the united nations conference on the standardization of geographical names the names of countries and territories specified in the lists above will be reserved at the second and all other levels of the med tld and thus will not be available for domain name registration a release of such a domain name will merely take place following an agreement with the respective government as well as after official approval by icann this release process will follow the guidelines that have been set out by the gac thus the relevant authority wishing to reserve its specific name will need to inform the gac secretariat after authentication the gac secretariat will transfer the request to icann and doccheck ag doccheck ag will then verify the availability of the name and issue an authorization number which will be transmitted to the beneficiary ie the registrant this beneficiary then can register the name with a registrar by providing the authorization number in order to ensure that relevant governments and authorities are aware of the process information regarding the registration of geographic domains will be displayed on doccheck ag’s major websites regarding registry activities additionally the process will be documented in the registration policies moreover doccheck ag will grant governments igos and public authorities the possibility to report and challenge abuses of geographical names and names with geographical significance reporting will be directed either towards the responsible registrar or towards doccheck ag itself if doccheck ag or a registered registrar receives such a complaint by any institution mentioned above the complaint will be inspected by doccheck ag’s very own validation agent and a decision will be made more information regarding the reporting process as well as the domain status during this process is specified in the answer to

by axfr⁄ixfrthe escrow data full and differential deposit is generated zipped and encrypted once a day and sent to the escrow agent in compliance with specification the complete srs database information is shared between both data centers primary site warmstandby this is achieved by realtime data synchronization in addition the srs program code and binaries are also shared between both data centers at any given time only one of the two data centers is actually running in production mode at a time while the other one is always on standby but not active until neededthe two data centers are connected through a vpn connection which is used for synchronization of the services described above in the unlikely event of the complete loss of one data center regengine can be switched from one site to another within minutes and with no data loss the dns⁄dnssec is secure and highly available due to its worldwide setupthe systemʹs complete interconnectivity is integrated into the system monitoring and ensures the readiness of the failover locations at any time in addition to monitoring a controlled failover testing from the production data center to the warmstandby data center is performed once a yearthese measures ensure compliance with registry continuity in specification d frequency of synchronization between serversthe frequency of the server synchronization depends on the service being synchronized some services are synchronized in realtime while others are synchronized at fixed periodsthe database is set up as a cluster solution with n redundancy in each data center since only one data center is running in production mode at a time the other data center is connected to the production database by realtime replication this guarantees a complete set of srs⁄dns information at all sitesas the dns⁄dnssec is generated from the database information regengine always has the complete zone file information available at both data center sites the zone file itself is generated every four minutes and uploaded to the primary hidden master name server from there the zone file is distributed to  of all dns servers worldwide within  secondsthe rdds whois is retrieved from the database in realtime and is available at both data center locations at all times like rdds the epp interface retrieves and submits its information in realtime and is also connected to the databasein addition to storing the complete registryrelated data in the database regengine also distributes the complete srs source and binary codes to both data center locations at all times this is achieved by a central repository which is synchronized at every locationthe combination of synchronization of source and binaries of each srsrelated service and the centralized database allows registrynet to switch from one data center to the other within  minutes during a failover the dns service remains unaffected by the switchthe data escrow files are generated in accordance with the registry specification  full deposit each sunday by  utc differential deposit monday through saturday by  utcthese measures ensure the compliance with registry continuity in specification e synchronization scheme warmstandbythe setup of the system includes two geographically separate data centers configured as a warmstandby system one active the other in warmstandby see attachment

registry launched in  this deep industry knowledge and experience has been transferred to the subsidiary registrynet gmbh launched against early internet drafts a great deal was learned in the first years leading to important protocol revisions some of these included changes to prevent the formation of orphaned glue records in an epp registry and the ability to affect mass internal host updates with a single request most importantly epp brought the required functionality of populating registration contact data in the registry allowing the subsequent implementation of a centralized or òthickó whois serviceepp was largely motivated by the growth in the number of accredited registrars that occurred beginning in  technologists working on epp believed that the emergence of many new tld registries was imminent and sought to ease the clienttoserver implementation work that would flood the registry⁄registrar community if a standardized protocol was not developed through which to interact with domain registries the effort was largely successful although there has been extensive distinct diversion among overlapping epp extensions between different registries over the

as internal host data and its relationship to domain objects the regengine registry fully implements the service discovery commands responses and the extension framework described a rfc this rfc explains the mapping of the primary epp registry object the domain object it reviews associated attributes and states of the domain object as well as child object relationships hosts it also details associations with other contact objects regengine complies with the full xml examples and descriptions and applies flexibility where permitted for example  allows operators to implement the info command with different responses for a òsponsoring registraró and a ònonsponsoring registraró in regards to most domain object attributes regengine implements this as a base protocol document for eppa rfc regengine implements this as a base protocol document for epp regengine notes this rfc describes the mapping of relationships to host objects which are by definition subordinate to the superordinate domain name object host objects that are defined as internal or in the namespace of the registry must be related to a superordinate domain object to be created internal hosts as full child objects face restrictions associated with the management of their superordinate domain object external hosts are hosts belonging to another domain namespace and as such are not subordinate in the present namespace internal hosts can have a glue or an a record associated with them external hosts refer to another namespace or zone for the associated a record a rfc another base rfc implemented in the regengine server this rfc describes the contact object mappings in epp contact objects are used to contain related data surrounding the standardized contacts types in tld registries including attributes such as contact type country telephone numbers email addresses etc as a standalone object a contact object can be created and associated with no domain objects or with any number of domain objects available in the registry this is used commonly by registrars to update common contact information associated across large numbers of domains in a single transaction like the domain object it can be secured with a passphrase or òauthinfoó code contact object data represents the definitive data source for authoritative rdds whois in new tlds a rfc regengine will implement this rfc as the preferred industry transport and in compliance with icannʹs requirements early implementations of epp were considered over beep this rfc describes a standard implementation of tcp incorporating tls as mentioned earlier epp can be implemented over multiple transports the transport of choice for the epp registry community has been tcp implementers are encouraged to take precautions against denial of service attacks through the use of standard technologies such as firewall and border router filters iana awarded port  as the dedicated port for the server side there is no dedicated port assignment for the client side a rfc regengine will implement this rfc as applicable to any extensions it utilizes as this rfc provides specific and detailed guidance on epp extensions an important principle in creating extensions to as opposed to modifying the epp protocol was to fully preserve the integrity of the existing protocol schema additionally a valid extension itself should be extensible another important requirement in the rfc is to include announcements of all available extensions in the epp server greeting element before establishing an interactive client session a rfc regengine will support this extension since this tld implements the grace period implementation known as the redemption grace period or òrgpó when rgp is in use domains are deleted into the rgp where registrars may request a restoration of the domain this is a billable event and requires a threestep process placement of the domain into a pending restore state submission of a restore report explaining why the domain is being restored and finally the restoration of the domain the rfc extends the domain update command adds related domain statuses such as ʺredemptionperiodʺ and ʺpendingrestoreʺ and extends the responses of domain info and other details the rfc provides a lifecycle description of the rgp and defines the format and content for client to server submission of the associated restore reports a rfc regengine will support dnssec from the initiation of this tld and therefore will also support this extension from initiation of the registration process dnssec is a mechanism for cryptographically verifying that each delegate zone in the dns hierarchy has been referred to or is referring to its genuine parent or child zone respectively since tld zone files are generated from authoritative registry data this extension specifically provides the ability to add elements to the domaincreate and domainupdate functions and to the domaininfo responses allowing registrars to submit associated delegated signer information of the child zone indicating it is digitally signed and that the parent zone recognizes the indicated key as a valid zone key for the child zone b extensions used by regengine and related internet draftsb drafttanepplaunchphase launch phase mapping for the eppregengine intends to use this epp internet draft to facilitate sunrise phases during the initiation of this tld registry this internet draft proposes an extension mechanism that supports the organization of sunrise related domain applications the extension considers the following elements〈lpphase〉this element allows a sunrise application submission to be marked by the epp client as a particular sunrise application type in respect to running different types of sunrise applications during a concurrent submission period regengine will use this to identify sunrise a and sunrise b application types 〈lpstatus〉this element allows the epp server to assign one of a number of statuses indicating what stage the sunrise application is in these statuses can be expressed through the domaininfo command response and optionally through the rdds service if applicable the statuses listed below can be assigned uniquely or in combinations where appropriate〈pvrc〉the prevalidation result code an opaque string issued by a thirdparty validation agent〈claimissuer〉contains the id of a contact object as described in rfc  rfc identifying the contact information of the authority which issued the right for example a trade mark office or company registration bureau〈claimname〉identifying the text string in which the applicant is claiming a prior right〈claimnumber〉the registration number of the right ie trademark number or company registration number〈claimtype〉indicates the type of claim being made eg trademark symbol combined mark company name〈claimentitlement〉indicates the applicantʹs entitlement to the claim ie owner or licensee〈claimregdate〉the date of registration of the claim 〈claimexdate〉the date of expiration of the claim〈claimcountry〉indicates the country in which the claim is valid〈claimregion〉indicates the

with ip limitations in addition to these technical restrictions the registry policy disallows data mining or comparable approaches of collecting datac technical overviewthe rdds whois service is set up as a two server cluster with a redundant loadbalancer in front of it to ensure a highly available solution n redundancy the server software is running on a suse linux enterprise server and is configured to be scalable allowing regengine to be extended by simply adding additional servers to the setup during regular operationsthe sizing of the servers and the databases are calculated to meet the needs of the individual business case and are able to handle a sustained and significant load the available rdds whois servers are always active at one regional site and may be switched to another regional site within minutes as necessary there are two different sites available for running the rdds whois service primary site munich germany secondary site st ingbert germany all sites have a permanent highly secure vpn connection to the current primary site in order to synchronize the complete srs epp dns⁄dnssec escrow and rdds whois related database information all network traffic between the vpn gateways will be encrypted using  bit rsa keys the complete availability of regengine information at all times allows a safe failover from the primary site to the secondary or disaster site within minutesthe rdds whois information data is stored in a mysql database which is setup as an active⁄active database cluster this cluster is permanently replicated to all other sites the rdds whois data is also stored daily by the regengine backup system the backups are also sent to the secondary sitein addition to the performance aspect of the rdds whois service the regengine detects abusive usage levels such as those that occur from excessive numbers of queries from one source this is accomplished by checking the source ip of the request on the port  rdds whois the webbased rdds whois comes with an additional captcha mechanism in order to prevent abusefurther protections to the whois service from incidents like ddos distributed denial of service attacks are assured by an ids intrusion detection system which provides regengine overall protectiondaily generated escrow data files containing all rdds whois related data are stored at the ncc group as the regengine escrow

the agp follows the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann agp consensus policy to charge the registrar for excessive deletion activity during this period during the agp the domain name is considered registered and therefore offers the same possibilities available during the registered period described below a domain name in the agp is included in the zone file and may not be

days the domain name will be released and available for new registration through a valid domain registration ordera releasedthe domain name is deleted from the srs and enters the available period the domain name will be immediately available for registration to all registrarsb domain name operationsb create domaina registrar uses the create command to register a domain name before a domain name can be created the registrar should use the check command to determine if the domain name is available the domain name will be registered for the period specified by the registrar this period may be from one to ten years the default is one year upon registration of a domain name the registrarʹs credit is immediately debited by the registration fee multiplied by the number of years requested the registry operator may also add an initial setup fee for a new registration to be included into the zone file the domain name must have at least two but no more than thirteen name servers the registrant may add an authentication code for the domain during the creation or a randomly generated authentication code will be set for the domain nameb delete domainthe delete domain command allows the owning registrar of the domain name to delete it a request to delete a domain name will cause all child name servers of the domain name to also be deleted a domain must not be deleted if it has child name servers hosting other domains when a domain name is deleted outside of the agp it goes into the redemptiongrace period status for  days when a domain name is deleted within the agp it is deleted immediately from the srs and the zone file and will be available for a new registrationb transfer domainthe transfer process begins when a registrar initiates a transfer with a transfer domain command the correct authentication code and sufficient funding in his account for the transfer domain fee the domain will be flagged in the srs as being requested for transfer òpendingtransferó status the current registrar has five calendar days to approve or reject the transfer request if the losing registrar explicitly approves the request the domain is transferred and one year is added to the expiration date however the registration period cannot exceed ten years total and will be capped at a maximum of ten years if the losing registrar explicitly denies the request then the transfer is immediately canceled and the requesting registrar will receive a refund of the transfer fee if the gaining registrar mistakenly sends a transfer request they may cancel the request as long as the transfer is pending in this case the requesting registrar receives a refund of the transfer fee once one of these three actions is complete the srs creates a poll message to all participating registrars for the domain name if no action is taken within five days the request is automatically approved by the srs batch system once a transfer is requested the losing registrar has the response options to reject approve or do nothing auto approve after the successful transfer of a domain name the old authentication code will be replaced with a new randomly generated authentication codeb update domainthe update command enables the owning registrar of the domain name to perform four different update operations on the domain name update the name servers the authentication code the associated contacts and the statuses of a domain name possible statuses that can be updated include òclientholdó òclientdeleteprohibitedó òclientupdateprohibitedó òclienttransferprohibitedó and òclientrenewprohibitedó if an update command removes all name servers of a domain name it will no longer be included in the zone file and will receive the status òinactiveób renew domainthe renew domain command allows the registrar of the domain name to extend the registration period if they have enough funds for the renew domain fee multiplied by the number of years the registration period will be extended for this tld only one year renewals will be offered the request for a renewal should contain the period to identify the number of years to be added to the registration period if not provided the srs uses a default value of one year the renewal request should contain the current expiration date to ensure that the domain name will not be renewed multiple times if the request was submitted multiple times due to connection problems between the srs and the registrar if no expiration date is given the srs will automatically use the current expiration date as the default value the srs will renew the domain name for the period specified by the registrar and returns the new registration expiration dateb restore domainthe restore domain command enables a registrar to restore a deleted domain name after the agp in order to successfully restore a domain the registrar must submit a restore domain command and have sufficient funding for the restore domain fee the restore operation adds the òpendingrestoreó status to the domain name until completion of the request a successful restore will extend the registration period of the domain name by one year but is capped at a total registration period of ten years after the restore operation the domain name will be added back into the zone file as long as there is at least one name server and no òclientholdó or òserverholdó status associated if the restore operation fails the domain will stay in the rgp until it enters the pending delete period and the registrar will receive a refund of the restore domain feec domain name statusesto ensure the registration domain life cycle there are several domain statuses that can be seen by everyone using the rddp whois or by any registrar using the extensible provisioning protocol epp these statuses are very important in identifying the current period a domain name is in or identifying the problems a registrar can encounter while managing a domain name eg a failing transfer request caused by a òservertransferprohibitedó status a foreign registrar may also be interested in the statuses of a domain name to identify when a specific domain name will be available for registration again drop catching domain name statuses include epp and rgp domain name statuses as referenced in rfc  depending on the life cycle period of a domain name it can have an epp and a rgp status at the same time in some cases these two statuses can be differentthese domain statuses are compliant with the rfcs   and  the domain statues are addperiod autorenewperiod

fullyvalidated namespace in spite of other namespaces med will provide a certain level of reputation because of the validation procedures as well as transparent strict and fair policies regarding eligible registrantsdoccheck ag will implement protection mechanisms designed to preclude any abusive registrations within the space these mechanisms are validation of domain name registrant’s background regarding his or her affiliation with the medical and healthcare community such affiliation can be proven for example by approbation documents licenses or certifications please refer to section g registrant authentication for more information assuring that published content in the namespace is in line with the predefined code of conduct and regulations concerning preferred content through a single point of contact for complaints regarding abusive behavior cases of such behavior will be consequently pursued if necessary all actions possible defined in the registration policies will be carried out in cases of doubt doccheck ag intends to implement a dispute resolution process additionally to the standard processes already defined by icann such a process can be described as a community audit where community members themselves instead of doccheck ag gain the right to decide which content may and may not be published among the community namespacedoccheck ag will additionally develop a trusted method of communication for all correspondence between doccheck ag and the tldʹs registrars to ensure that all registrant contact information including whois records is complete and remains current and that all requests for registration within the space may be easily verified for authenticity implement effective mechanisms for addressing abusive practices establish a point of contact for thirdparty reporting of abusive practices ensure accurate whois data by implementing and enforcing a strict registration and validation policy the registryregistrar agreement will furthermore include the obligation of accredited registrars to validate and verify each registration request determine and implement a streamlined practice for addressing and removing orphan glue records publish on its website and include as binding registry policy an antiabuse policy described in detail below which provides applicable definitions of abuse and outlining steps doccheck ag will take to address any such situationsa point of contact for abuse complaintsthe abuse email inbox will be routinely and continuously monitored several times per day complainants will be provided with a responsive communication containing an auditable tracking or case numberthe abuse point of contact will be responsive and effective tasked with answering email quickly empowered to take effective action and guided by welldefined written criteria this rolebased function will be performed by a team of trained and qualified staff which will ensure that the abuse point of contact has a broad familiarity with current industry knowledge and a highlevel awareness of evolving online security risks initially at least one designated employee will be tasked with overseeing the tld as part of his⁄her duties one or more additional employees will be trained in the role as well in order to provide “back up” assistance as needed the abuse point of contact will be supported by one or more attorneys at law with whom the abuse point of contact will consult and coordinate the correct management of disputes and reported abuse with regard to the estimated number of registrations and the registration restrictions these allocated resources will be sufficient to handle the expected initial volume of abuse complaints abuse complaint metrics will be tracked and reviewed carefully each year and adequate resources will be expended to ensure appropriate trending of those metrics thus providing the abuse point of contact with sufficient resourcesgiven doccheck ag’s belief that infrastructure protection rights protection and user security are of paramount importance for a tld owner doccheck ag expects to ensure sufficient resources for this critical role and to do whatever is reasonably necessary to ensure a secure and trusted zoneb antiabuse policydoccheck ag will develop and implement upon launch of the tld an antiabuse policy aap the aap will be made binding for all registrants by contractually obligating registrars through the registryregistrar agreement to pass on the aap as part of their registration agreements the aap will also be published prominently on the registry website alongside the abuse point of contact and with instructions on how to best report any suspected violations of the aap to the registrythe aap will be based on and expand upon existing registry policies to ensure best industry practice is followed the goal of the aap is to limit significant harm to internet users to enable doccheck ag or accredited registrars to investigate and to take action in case of malicious use of domain names and to deter registrants from engaging in illegal or fraudulent use of domain namesdoccheck ag defines abuse as an action that causes actual and substantial harm or is a material predicate of such harm and is illegal illegitimate or otherwise contrary to company policy“abuse” includes but is not limited to the following use of a domain to defraud or attempt to defraud members of the public in any way use of a domain to distribute or publish hateful defamatory or derogatory content based on racial ethnic or political grounds intended or

lock hold or similar status name during resolution of an investigation or disputec handling of abuse reportsall abuse reports received by the abuse point of contact will be tracked internally in a ticketing system to ensure accountability and ease of reference and a tracking number will be provided to the reporter each report will be carefully reviewed and evaluated regarding its credibility to determine whether the reported issue is an abuse concern and to assess the required actions if any doccheck ag will work in tandem with the sponsoring registrar as well as the registry service provider to rapidly address potential threats or abuse complaints investigate all reasonable complaints and take any appropriate actions theretoas standard practice doccheck ag will forward all credible and actionable reports including the accompanying evidence if any to the sponsoring registrar with a request to investigate the issue further and to take appropriate action the sponsoring registrar has a direct relationship with the registrant and therefore possesses further information not available to doccheck ag such as payment details sales history and ip addresses of the customer reseller data if applicable and other specific data unique to the customer in case the registrar determines in the course of the investigation that the use of the domain name violates the applicable terms of use icann policies or the aap the registrar is expected to take action within reasonable time doccheck ag further reserves the right to act directly and immediately in cases of obvious and significant malicious conductdoccheck ag will implement valid court orders or seizure warrants from courts arbitration tribunals or law enforcement agencies of applicable jurisdiction as a top priority doccheck ag will further work closely with law enforcement agencies if necessarybased upon the applicable registration policies and restrictions doccheck ag does not expect further measures to be required to effectively prevent or stop malicious use in case of an unexpected volume of credible abuse complaints doccheck ag will take advantage of additional resources such as spam databases and blocklists antiphishing feeds analysis of registration data and dns queriesd orphan glue recordsaccording to the icann ssac paper sac at http⁄⁄wwwicannorg⁄en⁄committees⁄security⁄sacpdf orphan glue records are defined as follows“by definition orphan records used to be glue records a glue record becomes an ‘orphan’ when the delegation point ns record referencing it is removed without also removing the corresponding glue record the delegation point ns record is sometimes referred to as the parent ns record”an orphan glue record can occur whenever a domain is placed in serverhold or clienthold status in these cases the domain is removed from the zone file but existing name servers of this domain will be kept in the zone file so that other sites which are still using these name servers are still kept functionalexample“examplestring” is deleted from the zone file by setting to serverhold status but “nsexamplestring” will be kept in the zone filed prevention of orphan glue records during domain deletiondeleting a domain name is only possible if there are no glue records used by other domains associated with the domain being deletedif there are glue records available but not used by other domains in the registry the glue records will be deleted prior to the domain deletion whenever there are glue records available which are still in use this has to be resolved first if there are no glue records at all the domain can be deleted instantlysolving the problem of glue records for domains which are supposed to be deleted can be done by checking the zone file the zone file reveals the domains which are using the name servers once the required information is available the named registrars must be contacted and new name servers should be set for the remaining domains in order to release the glue recordsin cases where glue records are being used in a malicious way the abuse point of contact has to be contacted the abuse point of contact will check this issue and take any appropriate actions which may result in removing relevant records from the zone file in case the abuse complaint is valide preventive countermeasurespharming is an abusive practice used to gain illegal access to personal and confidential internet user information by diverting internet traffic through the manipulation of the information between the recursive resolver name server and the client software eg web browser dnscache poisoning since pharming is commonly accomplished by redirecting traffic at the recursive dns level mitigation is most effective at the isp levelhowever as an added countermeasure the registry service provider registrynet will sign the domain zone using dnssec as detailed in the answer to question  allowing the relying party to establish a chain of trust from the dns root down to the domain name thus validating dns queries in the zoneregistrars will be encouraged to use a dnssec enabled dns hoster and to provision the related delegation signers originating from the dns hoster to registrynet’s srs via epp this way it will be possible for the relying party to validate dns queries and to protect from dns tampering to a certain degreednssec is a set of records and protocol modifications that provide authentication of the signer of the dns data verification of integrity of the dns data against modification nonrepudiation of dns data that have been signed and authenticated denial of existence of dns records dns data secured with dnssec are cryptographically signed and incorporate asymmetric cryptography in the dns hierarchy whereby trust follows the same chain as the dns tree meaning that trust originates from the root and is delegated in the same way as the control of a domain when a domain name in the tld is requested by a browser the signature is validated with the public key stored in the parent zonef promoting accurate whois datadoccheck ag is committed to maintaining the zone as a safe and secure online environment a key component of such a plan is the creation and upkeep of accurate whois records for the registry as indicated in detail in the above answer to question  doccheck ag will develop strong safeguards to verify the accuracy and privacy of the data stored in the whois database and will ensure that such records will be publiclyavailable to the extent required by icann regulations the whois records for this tld will constitute a “thick” whois combining all applicable data and information for domain name registrants in a central locationdoccheck ag shall expressly reserve the right to cancel or suspend any domain name registrations within the space should a registrant fail to provide accurate or complete whois information details will be executed in the registration guidelinesin order to ensure whois accuracy registrars will be obligated by the registryregistrar agreement to commit registrants to provide only current accurate and complete whois data according to the registration guidelines the registry service provider will ensure that registrars comply with the contractual agreements to provide accurate data including the use of fieldvalid telephone and fax numbers and the use of country names as defined under iso  complaints about inaccurate whois information can be filed by everyone via internics website http⁄⁄wwwinternicorg the welldeveloped process for the whois data problem reports wdpr will assure a prompt investigation by the responsible registrar and  in case  correction of whois dataregistrars will be obligated by the rra to fulfill icanns whois data reminder policy wdrp this means a registrar must present to the registrant the current whois information and remind the registrant that provision of false whois information can be grounds for cancellation of their domain name registration registrants must review their whois data and make any correctionsdoccheck ag will take adequate measures to ensure whois accuracy by random examinations of whois data against public registers like telephone directories or other suitable measuresg registrant authenticationpossible registrars will be responsible for making sure that only authenticated registration requests will be submitted to the registry ensuring the accuracy of the whois effectively this will ensure accurate and prevalidated whois data at first before being eligible for domain name registration registrants have to acquire community access via registration of a doccheck portal account free of charge guaranteed when doing so a background check on the registrant is performed on the basis of her or his personal data and certificates of profession or occupation see question  and  for further description this background check is performed by doccheck ag doccheck ag provides the eligible registrant with a unique code and supplies an api for registrars to validate said code only registrants with a valid registrant code are eligible to register domain names under the gtld med the registrar will be obligated by registryregistrar agreement to validate the registrant eligibility as the whole process is safeguarded it is ensured that only prevalidated registrants can make a successful domain name request to registrars and therefore only authenticated registration requests will be submitted to the registry doccheck ag will accordingly maintain strict control over the registration and use of this tldʹs domain namesi ensuring proper access to domain functionsthe registry will be operated using a comprehensive and detailed authentication system designed to implement a wide range of registry functions for both internal operations and as external registrar access registrar access will be limited by ip address control lists and tls⁄ssl certificates as well as verification processes for proper authentication and appropriate limitations to restrict access to the sponsored objectseach domain name will be assigned a unique authinfo code the authinfo code is a  to character code assigned by the registrar at the time a domain is created and which can be modified by the registrar at any time its purpose is to aid in the identification of the domain owner so that proper authority can be established for example a registrartoregistrar transfer can be initiated only by using the correct authinfo code to ensure that domain updates update contact information transfer or deletion are undertaken by the authorized registrant access to the domain’s authinfo code stored in the registry is limited to the sponsoring registrar and is accessible only via encrypted passwordprotected channelsregistrars will be obligated by the rra to provide best practice processes like formofauthorization foa emails to confirm a domain name transfer and will be encouraged to take advantage of the domain status clienttransferprohibited to mitigate abusefurther security measures are anticipated and will be implemented in the new space but are currently treated as

trademark holders of qualified sunrise applications for textual strings that present an identical match to their trademarks the clearinghouse system will be comprised of the following elements registration of marks in the clearinghouse by trademark holders will be validated by the clearinghouse operator utilizing trademark filings and other rights as applicable under the established policies for the trademark clearinghouse an asynchronous comparison of marks submitted during sunrise with the trademark clearinghouse should an exact match be identified between an appliedfor textual string and a mark registered in the clearinghouse database notification will be provided to the relevant mark holder and the sunrise applicant in the manner and means specified in doccheck ag guidebookthe company will comply with all required elements of the trademark clearinghouse system and will utilize a trademark validation agent as necessary to assist with the sunrise procedureb sunrise procedureb sunrise mechanismthe tld sunrise period will be conducted in compliance with icann specifications doccheck ag will develop a fully compliant sunrise policy which will define what domains may be applied for during sunrise applications and detail all dispute policies including its sdrp sunrise dispute resolution policy for challenging the validity of sunrise registration this very sunrise policy will include different phases for trademark owners and holder of other rights members of the community and communitysupporting organizations as well as institutionary petitioners the elected sdrp dispute provider will be a member of icann’s list of approved udrp providers doccheck ag will consult with both the dispute provider and expert legal counsel in drafting and finalizing the sunrise policythe sunrise period will run for a minimum of  days prior to the general availability of domain names and will include a minimum two week quiet period the registration functions will not be available during the quiet period while we work to complete related trademark clearinghouse matches and related notificationsc eligible rightsthe proposed sunrise eligibility

above and the sunrise applicant has been determined to meet the eligibility requirements for registration in this tld multiple applications for the same string were they to occur would be allowed from multiple trademark holders contention would be resolved through auction were there to be more than one qualifying applicant following winning an auction or if there is a single qualifying applicant the application would be promoted to a full domain registrationd field submission and validation safeguardsto support the sunrise process the registry system will apply requirements to data submissions in the registry application registrynet will use the data fields⁄extensions from the dotasia and dotxxx launches the field types listed below are mandatory during sunrise submissions and are not able to be updated once an application has been submitted in order to avoid manipulation of the validation process please see the related epp extension in figurepdf attached to the question

mentioned previously we will employ a third party trademark validator to examine sunrise applications the trademark validator will have the ability to request additional data or clarifying materials about any sunrise application including additional direct verification of the sunrise applicant’s identity in respect to the cited trademarkthe contracted party will be globally experienced in intellectual property law and will employ the following stepped process and functionsexamination of trademarktrademarks will be validated against either the trademark clearinghouse or against a national trademark database from a qualifying country this is required for a sunrise application to be considered “qualified or validated”deterrentsin policy documents training materials and faqs we will communicate clear language indicating that administration fees associated with filing sunrise applications are not refundable the administration fee will be designed to recover validation costs and should financially dissuade frivolous applicationsd contending applications sunrise auctionsthe registry will complete all sunrise application validations following the close of the sunrise period there are only three possibilities for outcome and subsequent actions one valid application for a given string  the domain will be awarded to that applicant two or more valid applications for the same

the registry disallowing participation in sunrise auctions see also the answer to question e sunrise challengesthe sunrise dispute resolution process sdrp will allow challenges based on the following four grounds at the time the challenged domain name was registered the registrant did not hold a trademark registration of national effect the domain name is not identical to the mark on which the registrant based its sunrise registration the trademark registration on which the registrant based its sunrise registration is not of national effect or regional effect the trademark registration on which the domain name registrant based its sunrise registration did not issue on or before the effective date of the registry agreement and was not applied for on or before icann announced the applications receivedwe see that icann’s module  “trademark clearinghouse” document paragraph  says “the clearinghouse will maintain the sers validate and authenticate marks as applicable and hear challenges” we are not sure exactly what “hearing challenges” means if it means that the clearinghouse provider is the only party that can adjudicate sunrise challenges then of course the tldʹs sunrise challenges will go there to be heard otherwise we will retain the services of a wellknown dispute resolution provider such as wipo to receive and adjudicate the sunrise challenges all applicants and registrars will be contractually obligated to follow the decisions handed down by the dispute resolution providerafter any sunrise name is awarded to an applicant it will remain under a “sunrise lock” status for at least  days so that parties will have an opportunity to file sunrise challenges during this sunrise lock period the domain name will not resolve and cannot be modified transferred or deleted by the sponsoring registrar the domain name will be unlocked at the end of that lock period only if it is not the subject of a sunrise challenge challenged domains will remain locked until the dispute resolution provider has issued a decision which the registry operator will promptly executef continuing rights protection mechanisms in the specific tld spacefollowing the conclusion of the sunrise period for this tld space certain rights protection mechanisms will continue to be active these mechanisms are the dispute resolution policies which shall include the urs

execute further operations upon notice from the urs providers each urs provider is required to specify the remedy and required actions of the registry operator with notification to the registrant the complainant and the registrar we will set up the necessary dns repointing required by the urs guidelinesthe guidelines state that if the complainant prevails the “registry operator shall suspend the domain name which shall remain suspended for the balance of the registration period and would not resolve to the original web site the nameservers shall be redirected to an informational web page provided by the urs provider about the urs the whois for the domain name shall continue to display all of the information of the original registrant except for the redirection of the nameservers in

trademark validation procedures during the sunrise phase will prevent the registration of effective phishing domains during the startup periodin our answer to question  “abuse prevention and mitigation” above we described our strong antiabuse program which is proven to shut down phishing and pharming and has provisions for rapid takedown of domain name abuses the system prompts notification of relevant registrars for rapid takedown action should phishing activity be identified please see the full explanation of this system above under question this program will deter bad actors from operating within the space by reducing the effectiveness of their attempts to initiate phishing domains without infringing upon the rights of legitimate registrants since pharming is commonly accomplished by redirecting traffic at the recursive dns level mitigation is effective at the isp levelh monitoring of the success of abuse prevention programsevery six months the antiphishing working group apwg publishes its latest global phishing survey which is made publicly available on the group’s website this study contains an analysis of phishing per tld doccheck ag will review the performance of our antiabuse program by using the apwg reports and other metrics developed within the security community doccheck ag notes that according the apwg’s available data for  only around  of malicious phishing sites contained a brand name or misspelled variant in the relevant domain name and that in the  data only  brandtargeted phishing sites were known worldwide accordingly phishing represents a very small percentage of brandtargeted domain name registrations and doccheck ag believes its adopted best practices and restrictive registration policies will mitigate the risk of bad actors entering the tld space a security policy summary of the security policy for the proposed registry question  a  security policyregistrynet gmbh as the registry backend provider of the
