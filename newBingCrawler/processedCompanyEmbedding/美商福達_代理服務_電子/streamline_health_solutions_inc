and   see our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item  herein  index to financial statements contracts the company enters into master agreements with its clients that specify the scope of the system to be installed and services to be provided by the company as well as the agreedupon aggregate price and the timetable for services typically these are multielement arrangements that include a perpetual or term license installed locally at the client site or the right to use the company’s solutions as a part of saas services and an initial maintenance term and any thirdparty components including hardware and software included with saas services as well as professional services for implementation integration process engineering optimization and training if the client purchases solutions via saas the client is billed periodically for a specified term from one to seven years in length the saas fee includes all maintenance and support services the company also generally provides saas clients professional services for implementation integration process engineering optimization and training professional services are typically fixedfee or hourly arrangements billable to clients based on agreedto milestones or monthly the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system the implementation schedule requested by the client and usage by clients of saas therefore it is difficult for the company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period the company’s master agreements generally provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by the company or may delay certain aspects of the installation a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement or the failure of the company to procure additional agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

described below before deciding to invest in our common stock or other securities if any of the following risks develops into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected the market price of our common stock or other securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment risks relating to our business our sales have been concentrated in a small number of clients our revenues have been concentrated in a relatively small number of large clients and we have historically derived a substantial percentage of our total revenues from a few clients for the fiscal years ended january   and   our five largest clients accounted for  and  of our total revenues respectively if one or more clients terminate all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations or if we fail to procure additional agreements there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a significant increase in new software as a service “saas” contracts could reduce nearterm profitability and require a significant cash outlay which could adversely affect near term cash flow and financial flexibility if new or existing clients purchase significant amounts of our saas services we may have to expend a significant amount of initial setup costs and time before those new clients are able to begin using such services and we cannot begin to recognize revenues from those saas agreements until the commencement of such services accordingly we anticipate that our nearterm cash flow revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by significant incremental setup costs from new saas clients that would not be offset by revenue until new saas clients go into production while we anticipate longterm growth in profitability through increases in recurring saas subscription fees and significantly improved profit visibility any inability to adequately finance setup costs for new saas solutions could result in the failure to put new saas solutions into production and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations in addition this nearterm cash flow demand could adversely impact our financial flexibility and cause us to forego otherwise attractive business opportunities or investments the potential impact on us of new or changes in existing federal state and local regulations governing healthcare information could be substantial healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse effect on our business however we cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final or any other regulations that might be adopted the us congress may adopt legislation that may change override conflict with or preempt the currently existing regulations and which could restrict the ability of clients to obtain use or disseminate patient health information although the features and architecture of our existing solutions can be modified it may be difficult to address the changing regulation of healthcare information the healthcare industry is highly regulated any material changes in the political economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affect the group purchasing business or the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry could require us to modify our services or reduce the funds available to providers to purchase our solutions and services our business financial condition and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly our ability to grow will depend upon the economic environment of the healthcare industry generally as well as our ability to increase the number of solutions that we sell to our clients the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences factors such as  index to financial statements changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses consolidation in the healthcare industry regulation litigation and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices operation and ultimately the operating funds of healthcare organizations in particular changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry such as any increased regulation by governmental agencies of the purchase and sale of medical products or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements could require us to make unplanned modifications of our solutions and services or result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce funds and demand for our solutions and services our clients derive a substantial portion of their revenue from thirdparty private and governmental payors including through medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored programs our sales and profitability depend in part on the extent to which coverage of and reimbursement for medical care provided is available from governmental health programs private health insurers managed care plans and other thirdparty payors if governmental or other thirdparty payors materially reduce reimbursement rates or fail to reimburse our clients adequately our clients may suffer adverse financial consequences which in turn may reduce the demand for and ability to purchase our solutions or services we face significant competition including from companies with significantly greater resources we currently compete with many other companies for the licensing of similar software solutions and related services several companies historically have dominated the clinical information systems software market and several of these companies have either acquired developed or are developing their own content management analytics and codingclinical documentation improvement solutions as well as the resultant workflow technologies the industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively many of these companies are larger than us and have significantly more resources to invest in their businesses in addition information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market suppliers and companies with whom we may establish strategic alliances also may compete with us such companies and vendors may either individually or by forming alliances excluding us place bids for large agreements in competition with us a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in any one of our three solutions stacks content management analytics and codingclinical documentation improvement workflow technologies or other markets addressed by us could have a material adverse effect on us the healthcare industry is evolving rapidly which may make it more difficult for us to be competitive in the future the us healthcare system is under intense pressure to improve in many areas including modernization universal access and controlling skyrocketing costs of care we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are client recommendations and references company reputation system reliability system features and functionality including ease of use technological advancements client service and support breadth and quality of the systems the potential for enhancements and future compatible solutions the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor in addition we believe that the speed with which companies in our market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors if we are unable to keep pace with changing conditions and new developments we will not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors rapid technology changes and short product life cycles could harm our business the market for our solutions and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies regulatory requirements evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing solutions obsolete or less competitive as a result our position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products as well as the pricing models for such products our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing solutions and services and to develop and introduce new solutions and services to meet changing requirements moreover competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our operating results we need to maintain an ongoing research and development program to continue to develop new solutions and apply new technologies to our existing solutions but may not have sufficient funds with which to undertake such required research and development if we are not able to foresee changes or to react in a timely manner to such developments we may experience a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our solutions and services our intellectual property which represents an important asset to us has some protection against infringement through copyright and trademark law we generally have little patent protection on our software we rely upon license agreements employment agreements confidentiality agreements nondisclosure agreements and similar agreements to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and trade secrets notwithstanding these precautions others may copy reverse  index to financial statements engineer or design independently technology similar to our solutions if we fail to protect adequately our intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights license agreements employment agreements confidentiality agreements nondisclosure agreements or similar agreements our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others invalidated or challenged and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage we may have it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend our proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others any litigation could be successful or unsuccessful may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel due to the rapid pace of technological change we believe our future success is likely to depend upon continued innovation technical expertise marketing skills and client support and services rather than on legal protection of our intellectual property rights however we have in the past aggressively asserted our intellectual property rights when necessary and intend to do so in the future we could be subjected to claims of intellectual property infringement that could be expensive to defend while we do not believe that our solutions and services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties the potential for intellectual property infringement claims continually increases as the number of software patents and copyrighted and trademarked materials continues to rapidly expand any claim for intellectual property right infringement even if not meritorious could be expensive to defend if we were held liable for infringing third party intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damage awards and potentially be required to cease using the technology produce noninfringing technology or obtain a license to use such technology such potential liabilities or increased costs could be material to us over the last several years we have completed a number of acquisitions and may undertake additional acquisitions in the future any failure to adequately integrate past and future acquisitions into our business could have a material adverse effect on us over the last several years we have completed several acquisitions of businesses through asset and stock purchases we expect that we will make additional acquisitions in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks including but not limited to • the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition including the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs or the inability to achieve expected synergies or cost savings • unanticipated expenses related to acquired businesses or technologies and their integration into our existing businesses or technology • the diversion of financial managerial and other resources from existing operations • the risks of entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger positions • potential writeoffs or amortization of acquired assets or investments • the potential loss of key employees clients or partners of an acquired business • delays in client purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition • potential unknown liabilities associated with an acquisition and • the tax effects of any such acquisitions if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition finally if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligations related to the incurrence of indebtedness this could adversely affect the market price of our securities  index to financial statements third party products are essential to our software our software incorporates software licensed from various vendors into our proprietary software in addition thirdparty standalone software is required to operate some of our proprietary software modules the loss of the ability to use these thirdparty products or ability to obtain substitute thirdparty software at comparable prices could have a material adverse effect on our ability to license our software our solutions may not be errorfree and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities our solutions are very complex and may not be errorfree especially when first released although we perform extensive testing failure of any solution to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require us to correct the deficiency if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreedupon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting us to liability also we sometimes indemnify our clients against thirdparty infringement claims if such claims are made even if they are without merit they could be expensive to defend our license and saas agreements generally limit our liability arising from these types of claims but such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or under some circumstances a significant uninsured or underinsured judgment against us could have a material adverse impact on us we could be liable to third parties from the use of our solutions our solutions provide access to patient information used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing medical care the medical care provided by physicians and other medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice and other claims we attempt to limit any potential liability of ours to clients by limiting the warranties on our solutions in our agreements with our clients ie healthcare providers however such agreements do not protect us from thirdparty claims by patients who may seek damages from any or all persons or entities connected to the process of delivering patient care we maintain insurance which provides limited protection from such claims if such claims result in liability to us although no such claims have been brought against us to date regarding injuries related to the use of our solutions such claims may be made in the future a significant uninsured or underinsured judgment against us could have a material adverse impact on us our saas and support services could experience interruptions we provide saas for many clients including the storage of critical patient financial and administrative data in addition we provide support services to clients through our client support organization we have redundancies such as backup generators redundant telecommunications lines and backup facilities built into our operations to prevent disruptions however complete failure of all generators or impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty damage to the primary building or equipment inside the primary building housing our hosting center or client support facilities could cause a temporary disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend on the application hosting services any interruption in operations at our data center or client support facility could cause us to lose existing clients impede our ability to obtain new clients result in revenue loss cause potential liability to our clients and increase our operating costs our saas solutions are provided over an internet connection any breach of security or confidentiality of protected health information could expose us to significant expense and harm our reputation we provide remote saas solutions for clients including the storage of critical patient financial and administrative data we have security measures in place to prevent or detect misappropriation of protected health information we must maintain facility and systems security measures to preserve the confidentiality of data belonging to clients as well as their patients that resides on computer equipment in our data center which we handle via application hosting services or that is otherwise in our possession notwithstanding efforts undertaken to protect data it can be vulnerable to infiltration as well as unintentional lapse if confidential information is compromised we could face claims for contract breach penalties and other liabilities for violation of applicable laws or regulations significant costs for remediation and reengineering to prevent future occurrences and serious harm to our reputation the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business our success depends to a significant degree on our management sales force and technical personnel we must recruit motivate and retain highly skilled managers sales consulting and technical personnel including solution programmers database specialists consultants and system architects who have the requisite expertise in the technical environments in which our solutions operate competition for such technical expertise is intense our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on us  index to financial statements our future success depends upon our ability to grow and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our clients’ requirements we will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve greater demand for our products and services we cannot be certain that our systems procedures controls and human resources will be adequate to support expansion of our operations our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical administrative financial control and reporting systems we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases difficulties in managing any future growth including as a result of integrating any prior or future acquisition with our existing businesses could cause us to incur unexpected expenses render us unable to meet our clients’ requirements and consequently have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results we may not have access to sufficient or costefficient capital to support our growth execute our business plans and remain competitive in our markets as our operations grow and as we implement our business strategies we expect to use both internal and external sources of capital in addition to cash flow from normal operations we may need additional capital in the form of debt or equity to operate and to support our growth execute our business plans and remain competitive in our markets we may have no or limited availability to such external capital in which case our future prospects may be materially impaired furthermore we may not be able to access external sources of capital on reasonable or favorable terms our business operations could be subject to both financial and operational covenants that may limit the activities we may undertake even if we believe they would benefit our company potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business including the availability and cost of shortterm funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition if internally generated funds are not available from operations we may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and shortterm liquidity needs our access to funds under our revolving credit facility or pursuant to arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on the financial institutions ability to meet funding commitments financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience high volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time we must maintain compliance with the terms of our existing credit facilities the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our ongoing operations and we may not be able to find an alternative lending source if a default occurs in november  we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with wells fargo bank na as administrative agent and other lender parties thereto pursuant to the credit agreement the lenders agreed to provide a    senior term loan and a    revolving line of credit to our primary operating subsidiary at closing the company repaid indebtedness under its prior credit facility using approximately    of the proceeds provided by the term loan the prior credit facility with fifth third bank was terminated concurrent with the entry of the credit agreement the credit agreement includes customary financial covenants including the requirements that the company maintain certain minimum liquidity and achieve certain minimum ebitda levels on april   we received a waiver from the lender for noncompliance with the minimum ebitda covenant at january   pursuant to the terms of the waiver and amendment to the credit agreement from april   and each quarter thereafter we must reach agreement with the lenders as to the minimum applicable amount of ebitda we are required to achieve based on the most recent financial projections we submit to the lenders under the credit agreement if we are unable to reach agreement with the lenders or if the lenders do not approve our projections we will be in immediate breach of the minimum ebitda covenant additionally pursuant to the terms of the waiver and amendment to the credit agreement we are required to maintain additional minimum liquidity of at least i  through april   ii  from april   through and including july   iii  from july   through and including january   and iv  from january   through and including the maturity date of the credit facility the company was in compliance with the applicable loan covenants at january   if we do not maintain compliance with all of the continuing covenants and other terms and conditions of the credit facility or secure a waiver for any noncompliance we could be required to repay outstanding borrowings on an accelerated  index to financial statements basis which could subject us to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore if we needed to do so it may be difficult for us to find an alternative lending source in addition because our assets are pledged as a security under our credit facilities if we are not able to cure any default or repay outstanding borrowings our assets are subject to the risk of foreclosure by our lenders without a sufficient credit facility we would be adversely affected by a lack of access to liquidity needed to operate our business any disruption in access to credit could force us to take measures to conserve cash such as deferring important research and development expenses which measures could have a material adverse effect on us our outstanding preferred stock and warrants have significant redemption and repayment rights that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and available financing for our ongoing operations in august  we completed a private offering of preferred stock warrants and convertible notes to a group of investors for gross proceeds of  million in november  the convertible notes converted into shares of preferred stock the preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the holders thereof anytime after august   if not previously converted into shares of common stock we may not achieve the thresholds required to trigger automatic conversion of the preferred stock and alternatively holders may not voluntarily elect to convert the preferred stock into common stock the election of the holders of our preferred stock to redeem the preferred stock could subject us to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on our business results of operations and financial condition under the terms of the subordination and intercreditor agreement among the preferred stockholders the company and wells fargo our obligation to redeem the preferred stock is subordinated to our obligations under the senior term loan for additional information regarding the terms rights and preferences of the preferred stock and warrants see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item  herein and our other sec filings current economic conditions in the united states and globally may have significant effects on our clients and suppliers that could result in material adverse effects on our business operating results and stock price current economic conditions in the united states and globally and the concern that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged stagnant period could materially adversely affect our clients access to capital or willingness to spend capital on our solutions and services or their levels of cash liquidity with which to pay for solutions that they will order or have already ordered from us continued challenging economic conditions also would likely negatively impact our business which could result in  reduced demand for our solutions and services  increased price competition for our solutions and services  increased risk of collectability of cash from our clients  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable  reduced revenues and  higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues all of the foregoing potential consequences of the current economic conditions are difficult to forecast and mitigate as a consequence our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities the variability of our quarterly operating results can be significant our operating results have fluctuated from quartertoquarter in the past and we may experience continued fluctuations in the future future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include the relatively large size of client agreements unpredictability in the number and timing of system sales and sales of application hosting services length of the sales cycle delays in installations changes in clients financial condition or budgets increased competition the development and introduction of new products and services the loss of significant clients or remarketing partners changes in government regulations particularly as they relate to the healthcare industry the size and growth of the overall healthcare information technology markets any liability and other claims that may be asserted against us our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel national and local general economic and market conditions and other factors discussed in this report and our other filings with the sec the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements due to the inherent nature of these estimates we may be required to significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on us and on the results of operations and could result in the restatement of our prior period financial statements  index to financial statements failure to improve and maintain the quality of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures or other lapses in compliance could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information about us or subject us to potential liability in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for each of our fiscal years our management conducts a review of our internal control over financial reporting we are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner our operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our expansion into foreign markets which primarily consists of canada we sometimes receive payment in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect our net sales and gross margins from our nonus dollardenominated revenue as expressed in us dollars there is also a risk that we will have to adjust the pricing of solutions denominated in foreign currencies when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates risks relating to an investment in our securities the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile the public trading of our common stock is based on many factors that could cause fluctuation in the price of our common stock these factors may include but are not limited to • general economic and market conditions • actual or anticipated variations in annual or quarterly operating results • lack of or negative research coverage by securities analysts • conditions or trends in the healthcare information technology industry • changes in the market valuations of other companies in our industry • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships divestitures joint ventures or other strategic initiatives • announced or anticipated capital commitments • ability to maintain listing of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market • additions or departures of key personnel and • sales and repurchases of our common stock by us our officers and directors or our significant stockholders if any most of these factors are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our operating performance or financial condition if equity research analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline the trading market for our common stock may rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about our business and us we do not control the opinions of these analysts the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about our business or us furthermore if no equity research analysts conduct research or publish reports about our business and us the market price of our common stock could decline all of our debt obligations our existing preferred stock and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future will have priority over our common stock with respect to payment in the event of a bankruptcy liquidation dissolution or winding up  index to financial statements in any bankruptcy liquidation dissolution or winding up of the company our shares of common stock would rank in right of payment or distribution below all debt claims against us and all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock if any as a result holders of our shares of common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets in the event of a bankruptcy or upon a liquidation or dissolution until after all of our obligations to our debt holders and holders of preferred stock have been satisfied accordingly holders of our common stock may lose their entire investment in the event of a bankruptcy liquidation dissolution or winding up of our company similarly holders of our preferred stock would rank junior to our debt holders and creditors in the event of a bankruptcy liquidation dissolution or winding up of the company there may be future sales or other dilution of our equity which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock we are generally not restricted from issuing in public or private offerings additional shares of common stock or preferred stock except for certain restrictions under the terms of our outstanding preferred stock and other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or that represent a right to receive common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities such offerings represent the potential for a significant increase in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market made after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur in addition to our currently outstanding preferred stock the issuance of an additional series of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of shares of our common stock which may negatively impact your investment our board of directors is authorized to issue classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued including rights and preferences over the shares of common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution windingup and liquidation and other terms if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the shares of our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our dissolution winding up and liquidation or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the shares of our common stock the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected as of january   we had  shares of preferred stock outstanding for additional information regarding the terms rights and preferences of such stock see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item  herein and our other sec filings we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth therefore you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the public market may cause the market price of our common stock to fall the issuance of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in an offering from time to time could have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock in addition because our common stock is thinly traded resales of shares of our common stock by our largest stockholders or insiders could have the effect of depressing market prices for our common stock note regarding risk factors the risk factors presented above are all of the ones that we currently consider material however they are not the only ones facing our company additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us there may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us and our analysis might be wrong if any of the risks that we face actually occur our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forwardlooking statements that we have made or might make in such case the market price of our common stock or other securities could decline and you could

either perpetual software licenses or term licenses typically perpetual licenses included in backlog are either not yet generally available or the software is generally available and the client has not taken possession of the software term licenses included in backlog consist of signed agreements where the client has already taken possession but the payment for the software is bundled with maintenance and support fees over the life of the contract the increase in backlog is due to renewals exceeding the amount recognized out of the prior period backlog thirdparty hardware and software consists of signed agreements to purchase thirdparty hardware or thirdparty software licenses that have not been delivered to the client these are products that the company resells as components of the solution a client purchases and are expected to be delivered in the next twelve months as implementations commence professional services backlog consists of signed contracts for services that have yet to be performed typically backlog is recognized within twelve months of the contract signing the decrease in professional services backlog is a result of revenue recognition exceeding bookings maintenance and support backlog consists of maintenance agreements for licenses of the company’s proprietary software and thirdparty hardware and software with clients and remarketing partners for

typical maintenance contracts are for a oneyear term and are renewed annually clients typically prepay maintenance and support that is billed  days prior to the beginning of the maintenance period the company does not expect any significant client attrition over the next  months maintenance and support backlog at january   was   as compared to  at january    the increase in maintenance and support

system the implementation schedule requested by the client and ultimately the official golive on the system therefore it is difficult for the company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period all of the company’s master agreements are generally noncancelable but provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by the company or may delay certain aspects of the installation there can be no assurance that a client will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay portions of the agreement a termination or delay in one or more phases of an agreement or the failure of the company to procure additional agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations use of nongaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board of directors in its financial and operational decisionmaking the company has supplemented the consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following nongaap financial measures ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share these nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap the company compensates for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using nongaap financial measures only as supplemental data we also provide a reconciliation of nongaap to gaap measures used investors are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation in addition because these nongaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations these measures as defined by the company may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share we define i ebitda as net earnings loss before net interest expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization ii adjusted ebitda as net earnings loss before net interest expense income tax expense benefit depreciation amortization stockbased compensation expense transaction expenses and other expenses that do not relate to our core operations iii adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of gaap net revenue and iv adjusted ebitda per diluted share as adjusted ebitda divided by adjusted diluted shares outstanding ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share are used to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance consistently over time as they remove the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges asset base primarily depreciation and amortization items outside the control of the management team taxes and expenses that do not relate to our core operations including transactionrelated expenses such as professional and advisory services corporate restructuring expenses such as severances and other operating costs that are expected to be nonrecurring adjusted ebitda removes the impact of sharebased compensation expense which is another noncash item adjusted ebitda per diluted share includes incremental shares in the share count that are considered antidilutive in a gaap net loss position the board of directors and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating on at least a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations and ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive and associate incentive compensation programs  index to financial statements our lender uses a measurement that is similar to the adjusted ebitda measurement described herein to assess our operating performance the lender under our credit agreement requires delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are based on this measurement that is similar to the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and board of directors ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap or otherwise and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share as disclosed in this annual report on form k have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use some of the limitations of ebitda and its variations are • ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments • ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs • ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreements • ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make and • although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda to properly and prudently evaluate our business the company encourages readers to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business we also strongly urge readers to review the reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measure in this section along with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net loss a comparable gaapbased measure as well as adjusted ebitda per diluted share to loss per diluted share all of the items included in the reconciliation from ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net loss and the related per share calculations are either recurring noncash items or items that management does not consider in assessing our ongoing operating performance in the case of the noncash items management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company’s comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation amortization and other expenses that do not relate to our core operations and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance in the case of items that do not relate to our core operations management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance  index to financial statements the following

delivery has occurred or services have been rendered • the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and • collection is considered probable if the company determines that any of the above criteria has not been met the company will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met if nonstandard acceptance periods or nonstandard performance criteria cancellation or right of

pursuant to accounting standards update no  revenue recognition topic  “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements — a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force ” “asu ” the company follows this accounting guidance for revenue recognition of multiple deliverable revenue arrangements meaning the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets to determine whether such arrangements contain more than one unit of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the client on a standalone basis meaning the item can be sold separately by any vendor or the client could resell the item on a standalone basis additionally if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered items must be considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor allowance for doubtful accounts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed the company for solutions and services provided contracts with individual clients and resellers determine when receivables are due and payable in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts the unpaid receivables are reviewed monthly to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables during these monthly reviews the company determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its clients or resellers to make required payments capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either asc  software — costs of software to be sold leased or marketed  or asc  internaluse software  costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred once technological

amortization for our legacy software systems is provided on a solutionbysolution basis over the estimated economic life of the software using the straightline method amortization commences when a solution is available for general release to clients acquired internally developed software from acquisitions is amortized using the straightline method unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a solution are expensed at the date of such determination the company reviews on an ongoing basis the carrying value of its capitalized software development expenditures net of accumulated amortization goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets were recognized in conjunction with the interpoint meta clinical looking glass and unibased acquisitions identifiable intangible assets include purchased intangible assets with finite lives which primarily consist of internallydeveloped software client relationships supplier

consolidated financial statements included in part ii item  herein  index to financial statements we assess the useful lives and possible impairment of existing recognized goodwill on at least an annual basis and goodwill and intangible assets when an event occurs that may trigger such a review factors considered important which could trigger a review include • significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results • significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business • identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit • disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment • significant negative industry or economic trends • significant decline in the companys stock price for a sustained period and • a decline in the market capitalization relative to the net book value determining whether a triggering event has occurred involves significant judgment by the company income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax credit and loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled in assessing net deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item  herein for further details common stock warrants as of january    the fair value

specialist using montecarlo simulations see note   derivative liabilities for further details revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of internally developed software either by licensing or by software as a service saas through the direct sales force or through thirdparty resellers licensed locallyinstalled clients utilize the company’s support and maintenance services for a separate fee whereas saas fees include support and maintenance the company also derives revenue from professional services that support the implementation configuration training and optimization of the applications additional revenues are also derived from reselling thirdparty software and hardware components the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  softwarerevenue recognition and asc  revenue recognition — multipleelement arrangements  the company commences revenue recognition when the following criteria all have been met  index to financial statements • persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists • delivery has occurred or services have been rendered • the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and • collection is considered probable if we determine that any of the above criteria have not been met we will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met maintenance and support and saas agreements entered into are generally noncancelable or contain significant penalties for early cancellation although clients typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if the company fails to perform material obligations however if nonstandard acceptance periods or nonstandard performance criteria cancellation or right of refund terms are required revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such criteria as applicable multiple element arrangements the company applies the provisions of accounting standards update no  revenue recognition topic  “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements — a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” “asu ” asu  amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to • provide updated guidance on how deliverables of an arrangement are separated and how consideration is allocated • eliminate the residual method and require entities to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method and • require entities to allocate revenue to an arrangement using the estimated selling price “esp” of deliverables if it does not have vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” or third party evidence “tpe” of selling price terms used in evaluation are as follows • vsoe — the price at which an element is sold as a separate standalone transaction • tpe — the price of an element charged by another company that is largely interchangeable in any particular transaction • esp — the company’s best estimate of the selling price of an element of the transaction the company follows accounting guidance for revenue recognition of multipleelement arrangements to determine whether such arrangements contain more than one unit of accounting multipleelement arrangements require the delivery or performance of multiple solutions services andor rights to use assets to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the client on a standalone basis standalone value to a client is defined in the guidance as those that can be sold separately by any vendor or the client could resell the item on a standalone basis additionally if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered item or items must be considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor the company has a defined pricing methodology for all elements of the arrangement and proper review of pricing to ensure adherence to company policies pricing decisions include crossfunctional teams of senior management which uses market conditions expected contribution margin size of the client’s organization and pricing history for similar solutions when establishing the selling price software as a service the company uses esp to determine the value for a software as a service arrangement as the company cannot establish vsoe and tpe is not a practical alternative due to differences in functionality from the companys competitors similar to proprietary license sales pricing decisions rely on the relative size of the client purchasing the solution and include calculating the equivalent value of maintenance and support on a present value basis over the term of the initial agreement period typically revenue recognition commences upon client golive on the system and is recognized ratably over the contract term systems sales the company uses the residual method to determine fair value for proprietary software licenses sold in a multielement arrangement as the company cannot establish fair value for all of the delivered elements typically pricing decisions for proprietary software rely on the relative size and complexity of the client purchasing the solution thirdparty components are resold at prices based on a cost plus margin analysis the proprietary software and thirdparty components do not need any significant modification to achieve their intended use when these revenues meet all the criteria for revenue recognition and are determined to be separate units of accounting revenue is recognized typically this is upon shipment of components or  index to financial statements electronic download of software proprietary licenses are perpetual in nature and license fees do not include rights to version upgrades fixes or service packs maintenance and support services the maintenance and support components are not essential to the functionality of the software and clients renew maintenance contracts separately from software purchases at renewal rates materially similar to the initial rate charged for maintenance on the initial purchase of software the company uses vsoe of fair value to determine fair value of maintenance and support services generally maintenance and support is calculated as a percentage of the list price of the proprietary license being purchased by a client clients have the option of purchasing additional annual maintenance service renewals each year for which rates are not materially different from the initial rate but typically include a nominal rate increase based on the consumer price index annual maintenance and support agreements entitle clients to technology support upgrades bug fixes and service packs term licenses we cannot establish vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element in term license arrangements however as the only undelivered element is postcontract customer support the entire fee is recognized ratably over the contract term typically revenue recognition commences once the client goes live on the system similar to proprietary license sales pricing decisions rely on the relative size of the client purchasing the solution the software portion of our coding and clinical documentation improvement solutions generally does not require material modification to achieve their contracted function professional services professional services components that are not essential to the functionality of the software from time to time are sold separately by the company similar services are sold by other vendors and clients can elect to perform similar services inhouse when professional services revenues are a separate unit of accounting revenues are recognized as the services are performed based upon a proportional performance methodology professional services components that are essential to the functionality of the software and are not considered a separate unit of accounting are recognized in revenue ratably over the life of the client which approximates the duration of the initial contract term the company defers the associated direct costs for salaries and benefits expense for professional services contracts these deferred costs will be amortized over the identical term as the associated saas revenues as of january   and   the company had deferred costs of   and   respectively net of accumulated amortization of  and   respectively amortization expense of these costs was  and  in fiscal  and   respectively the company uses vsoe of fair value based on the hourly rate charged when services are sold separately to determine fair value of professional services the company typically sells professional services on an hourlyfee basis the company monitors projects to assure that the expected and historical rate earned remains within a reasonable range to the established selling price concentrations financial instruments which potentially expose the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable are concentrated in the healthcare industry however the company’s clients typically are wellestablished hospitals medical facilities or major health information systems companies that resell the company’s solutions that have good credit histories payments from clients have been received within normal time frames for the industry however some hospitals and medical facilities have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on thirdparty reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities and extended payment of receivables from these entities is not uncommon to date the company has relied on a limited number of clients and remarketing partners for a substantial portion of its total revenues the company expects that a significant portion of its future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of clients and its remarketing partners the company currently buys all of its hardware and some major software components of its healthcare information systems from thirdparty vendors although there are a limited number of vendors capable of supplying these components management believes that other suppliers could provide similar components on comparable terms business combinations  index to financial statements the assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration are recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognized in earnings these estimates are inherently uncertain and are subject to refinement management develops estimates based on assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date as a result during the purchase price measurement period which may be up to one year from the business combination date the company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill after the purchase price measurement period the company will record adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price measurement period in operating expenses in the period in which the adjustments were determined the company records acquisition and transaction related expenses in the period in which they are incurred acquisition and transaction related expenses primarily consist of legal banking accounting and other advisory fees of third parties related to potential acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets were recognized in conjunction with the interpoint meta clg and unibased acquisitions identifiable intangible assets include purchased intangible assets with finite lives which primarily consist of internally developed software client relationships supplier agreements noncompete agreements customer contracts and license agreements finitelived purchased intangible assets are amortized over their expected period of benefit which generally ranges from one to  years using the straightline and undiscounted expected future cash flows methods the indefinitelived intangible asset related to the meta trade name was not amortized but was tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in fiscal   the meta trade name was deemed impaired and its corresponding balance was fully written off see note   goodwill and intangible assets the company assesses the useful lives and possible impairment of existing recognized goodwill and intangible assets when an event occurs that may trigger such a review factors considered important which could trigger a review include • significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results • significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business • identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit • disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment • significant negative industry or economic trends • significant decline in the companys stock price for a sustained period and • a decline in the market capitalization relative to the net book value determining whether a triggering event has occurred involves significant judgment by the company the company assesses goodwill annually as of november  or more frequently when events and circumstances such as the ones mentioned above occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired the company did not note any of the above qualitative factors which would be considered a triggering event for impairment in assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting units fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management these judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events which are specific to the company and trends in the market price of the companys common stock each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact the twostep goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify its reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of those reporting units as of the impairment testing date reporting units are determined based on the organizational structure the entity has in place at the date of the impairment test a reporting unit is an operating segment or component business unit with the following characteristics a it has discrete financial information b segment management regularly reviews its operating results generally an operating segment has a segment manager who is directly accountable to and maintains regular contact with the chief operating decision maker to discuss operating activities financial results forecasts or plans for the segment and c its economic characteristics are dissimilar from other units this contemplates the nature of the products and services the nature of the production process the type or class of customer for the products and services and the methods used to distribute the products and services  index to financial statements the company determined that it has one operating segment and one reporting unit to conduct a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is first compared to its carrying value if the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value the company performs the second step and records an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using a blend of market and income approaches the market approach consists of two separate methods including reference to the companys market capitalization as well as the guideline publicly traded company method the market capitalization valuation method is based on an analysis of the companys stock price on and around the testing date plus a control premium the guideline publicly traded company method was made by reference to a list of publicly traded software companies providing services to healthcare organizations as determined by management the market value of common equity for each comparable company was derived by multiplying the price per share on the testing date by the total common shares outstanding plus a control premium selected valuation multiples are then determined and applied to appropriate financial statistics based on the companys historical and forecasted results the company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the income approach via discounted cash flow valuation models which include but are not limited to assumptions such as a “riskfree” rate of return on an investment the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant and future revenue operating margin working capital and capital expenditure trends determining the fair values of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results the company performed its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal   using the twostep approach described above the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill based on the analysis performed for step one the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill and therefore an impairment loss was not recognized as the company passed step one of the analysis step two was not required severances from time to time we will enter into termination agreements with associates that may include supplemental cash payments as well as contributions to health and other benefits for a specific time period subsequent to termination in fiscal  and   we incurred  and  in severance expenses at january   and   we had accrued for  and  in severances respectively equity awards the company accounts for sharebased payments based on the grantdate fair value of the awards with compensation cost recognized as expense over the requisite vesting period the company incurred total annual compensation expense related to stockbased awards of  and  in fiscal  and   respectively the fair value of the stock options granted in fiscal  and  was estimated at the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term expected volatility and riskfree interest rate impact the fair value estimate further the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation these assumptions are subjective and are generally derived from external such as riskfree rate of interest and historical data such as volatility factor expected term and forfeiture rates future grants of equity awards accounted for as stockbased compensation could have a material impact on reported expenses depending upon the number value and vesting period of future awards the company issues restricted stock awards in the form of company common stock the fair value of these awards is based on the market close price per share on the day of grant the company expenses the compensation cost of these awards as the restriction period lapses which is typically a one year service period to the company common stock warrants as of january    the fair value of the common stock warrants was computed using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities as of january   was computed using montecarlo simulations both valuations were based on assumptions regarding annual volatility riskfree rate dividend yield and expected life the models also include assumptions to account for antidilutive provisions within the warrant agreement other comprehensive income  index to financial statements total other comprehensive income for fiscal years  and  was approximately zero and   respectively total other comprehensive income relates to the change in the unrealized loss on the companys interest rate swap arrangement the companys interest rate swap arrangement is further described in note   debt income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax credit and loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled in assessing net deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized see note   income taxes for further details the company provides for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management’s assessment of whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities at january    the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any uncertain tax positions as part of the meta acquisition the company assumed a current liability for an uncertain tax position the company has recorded zero reserves for uncertain tax positions and corresponding interest and penalties as of both january   and january    net loss per common share the company presents basic and diluted earnings per share “eps” data for its common stock basic eps is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted eps is calculated based on the profit or loss attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive common stock issuances related to options unvested restricted stock warrants and convertible preferred stock potential common stock dilution related to outstanding stock options unvested restricted stock and warrants is determined using the treasury stock method while potential common stock dilution related to series a convertible preferred stock is determined using the “if converted” method the companys unvested restricted stock awards and series a convertible preferred stock are considered participating securities under asc  “earnings per share” which means the security may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock the companys unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities because they entitle holders to nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting term the holders of the series a preferred stock would be entitled to share in dividends on an asconverted basis if the holders of common stock were to receive dividends other than dividends in the form of common stock in accordance with asc  a company is required to use the twoclass method when computing eps when a company has a security that qualifies as a “participating security” the twoclass method is an earnings allocation formula that determines eps for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings in determining the amount of net earnings to allocate to common stock holders earnings are allocated to both common and participating securities based on their respective weightedaverage shares outstanding for the period diluted eps for the companys common stock is computed using the more dilutive of the twoclass method or the ifconverted method in accordance with asc  securities are deemed to not be participating in losses if there is no obligation to fund such losses for the years ended january   and   the unvested restricted stock awards and the series a preferred stock were deemed not to be participating since there was a net loss from operations for the years ended january   and   as of both january   and   there were  shares of preferred stock outstanding each share is convertible into one share of the companys common stock for the years ended january   and   the series a convertible preferred stock would have an antidilutive effect if included in diluted eps and therefore was not included in the calculation as of january   and   there were  and  unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding respectively these unvested restricted shares were excluded from the calculation as their effect would have been antidilutive the following is the calculation of the basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock  index to financial statements   fiscal year       net loss         less deemed dividends on series a preferred stock       net loss attributable to common shareholders         weighted average shares outstanding used in basic per common share computations     stock options and restricted stock —   — number of average shares used in diluted per common share computation     basic net loss per share of common stock         diluted net loss per share of common stock         diluted net loss per share excludes the effect of  and  outstanding stock options in fiscal  and   respectively the inclusion of these shares would have been antidilutive for fiscal  and  the outstanding common stock warrants of  would have an antidilutive effect if included in diluted eps and therefore were not included in the calculation loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate

rate swap agreement maturing december   which required the company to pay interest at a fixed rate of    and receive interest at a variable rate this interest rate swap agreement was designated to hedge    of a variable rate debt obligation the onemonth libor rate on each reset date determined the variable portion of the interest rate swap for the following month the interest rate swap settled any accrued interest for cash on the first day of each calendar month until expiration at such dates the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swap were included in interest expense no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swap because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swap represented prevailing rates for the counterparty

deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company established a valuation allowance of  and  at january   and   respectively the increase in the valuation allowance of  was driven primarily by losses incurred during the year ended january    management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the remaining deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances in future years due to the reporting requirements of asc   of the net operating loss carryforward tax effected   is not recorded on the company’s balance sheet because the loss was created by the tax benefits of stock option exercises which cannot be recognized for book purposes until the benefit has been realized by actually reducing taxes payable
