bluray refers to the blue laser specifically a violet laser used to read the disc which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longerwavelength red laser used

formats are similar the first dvr blue prototypes were unveiled at the ceatec exhibition in october  by sony a trademark for the blue disc logo was filed february   on february   the project was officially announced as bluray disc and bluray disc founders was founded by the nine initial members the first consumer device arrived in stores on april   the sony bdzs a  us bdre recorder that was made available only in japan but there was no standard for prerecorded video and no movies were released for this player hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with digital rights management before they would release movies for the new format and they wanted a new drm system that would be more secure than the failed content scramble system css used on dvds on october   the name bluray disc founders was officially changed to the bluray disc association bda and th century fox joined the bdas board of directors the bluray disc physical specifications were completed in  in january  tdk announced that they had now developed an ultrahard yet very thin polymer coating durabis for bluray discs this was a significant technical advance because a far tougher protection was desired in the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to dvd while technically bluray disc required a much thinner layer for the denser and higher frequency blue laser cartridges originally used for scratch protection were no longer necessary and were scrapped the bdrom specifications were finalized in early  aacs la a consortium founded in  had been developing the drm platform that could be used to securely distribute movies to consumers however the final aacs standard was delayed and then delayed again when an important member of the bluray disc group voiced concerns at the request of the initial hardware manufacturers including toshiba pioneer and samsung an interim standard was published that did not include some features such as managed

update more than  titles have been released competition from hd dvdedit main article high definition optical disc format war the dvd forum chaired by toshiba was split over whether to develop the more expensive blue laser technology in march  the forum approved a proposal which was endorsed by warner bros and other motion picture studios the proposal involved compressing hd video onto duallayer standard dvd discs in spite of this decision however the dvd forums steering committee announced in april that it was pursuing its own bluelaser highdefinition video solution in august toshiba and nec announced their competing standard advanced optical disc it was finally adopted by the dvd forum and renamed hd dvd the next year after being voted down twice by dvd forum members who were also bluray disc association members—a situation that drew preliminary investigations by the us department of justice hd dvd had a head start in the highdefinition video market as bluray disc sales were slow to gain market share the first bluray disc player was perceived as expensive and buggy and there were few titles available the appearance of the sony playstation  which contained a bluray disc player for primary storage helped support bluray sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign for the format avchd camcorders were also introduced in  these recordings can be played back on many bluray disc players without reencoding but are not compatible with hd dvd players by january  bluray discs had outsold hd dvds and during the first threequarters of  bd outsold hd dvd by about two to one at ces  warner proposed total hi def—a hybrid disc containing bluray on one side and hd dvd on the other but it was never released in a june   press release twentieth century fox cited bluray discs adoption of the bd anticopying system as key to their decision to support the bluray disc format on january   a day before ces  warner bros the only major studio still releasing movies in both hd dvd and bluray disc format announced that it would release only in bluray disc after may  this effectively included other studios that came under the warner umbrella such as new line cinema and hbo—though in europe hbo distribution partner the bbc announced it would while keeping an eye on market forces continue to release product on both formats this led to a chain reaction in the industry with major us retailers such as best buy walmart and circuit city and canadian chains such as future shop dropping hd dvd in their stores a then major european retailer woolworths dropped hd dvd from its inventory netflix and blockbuster—major dvd rental companies—said they would no longer carry hd dvd following these new developments on february   toshiba announced it would end production of hd dvd devices allowing bluray disc to become the industry standard for highdensity optical discs universal studios the sole major movie studio to back hd dvd since its inception said shortly after toshibas announcement while universal values the close partnership we have shared with toshiba it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on bluray disc paramount

opticsedit while a dvd uses a  nm red laser bluray disc uses a  nm blue laser diode note that even though the laser is called blue its color is actually in the violet range the shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a dvd and can consequently be spaced more closely resulting in a shorter track pitch enabling a bluray disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a dvd the lasers are gan gallium nitride laser diodes that produce  nm light directly that is without frequency doubling or other nonlinear optical mechanisms conventional dvds use  nm red lasers and cds use  nm nearinfrared lasers the minimum spot size on which a laser can be focused is limited by diffraction and depends on the wavelength of the light and the numerical aperture of the lens used to focus it by decreasing the wavelength increasing the numerical aperture from  to  and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects designers can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area for bluray disc the spot size is  nm this allows a reduction of the pit size from  nm for dvd to  nm for bluray disc and of the track pitch from  nm to  nm see compact disc for information on optical discs physical structure in addition to the optical improvements bluray discs feature improvements in data encoding that further increase the amount of content that can be stored hardcoating technologyedit since the bluray disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc compared to the dvd standard it was more vulnerable to scratches in early designs the first discs were therefore housed in cartridges for protection resembling professional discs introduced by sony in  using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium so designers chose hardcoating of the pickup surface instead tdk was the first company to develop a working scratchprotection coating for bluray discs naming it durabis in addition both sonys and panasonics replication methods include proprietary hardcoat technologies sonys rewritable media are spincoated using a scratchresistant and antistatic coating verbatims recordable and rewritable bluray discs use their own proprietary technology called hard coat the bluray disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches by mechanical abrasion in contrast dvd media are not required to be scratchresistant but since

same as the number used for the av stream file “zzzzzmts” that includes the mpeg mvc base view video stream auxdata directory contains sound data files and font files soundbdmv file stores data relating to one or more sounds associated with hdmv interactive graphic streams applications this file may or may not exist under the auxdata directory if it exists there shall be only one soundbdmv file aaaaaotf file stores the font information associated with text subtitle applications the names of these files are in the form “aaaaaotf” where “aaaaa” is a digit number corresponding to the font

transport stream it is also known as bdav mpeg transport stream and can use filename extension mts bluray disc titles authored with menus are in the bdmv bluray disc movie format and contain audio video and other streams in bdav container there is also the bdav bluray disc audiovisual format the consumer oriented alternative to the bdmv format used for movie releases the bdav format is used on bdres and bdrs for audiovideo recording bdmv format was later defined also for bdre and bdr in september  in the third revision of bdre specification and second revision of bdr specification bluray disc employs the mpeg transport stream recording method that enables transport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are broadcast without altering the format it also enables flexible editing of a digital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just by rewriting the playback stream although it is quite natural a function for highspeed and easytouse retrieval is built in bluray disc video use mpeg transport streams compared to dvds mpeg program streams an mpeg transport stream contains one or more mpeg program streams so this allows multiple video programs to be stored in the same file so they can be played back simultaneously eg with pictureinpicture effect codecsedit the bdrom specification mandates certain codec compatibilities for both hardware decoders players and movie software content windows media player does not come with the codecs required to play bluray discs videoedit originally bdroms stored video up to × pixel resolution at up to   fields per second currently with uhd bdrom videos can be stored at a maximum of × pixel resolution at up to   frames per second progressively scanned while most current bluray

of bits per color ycbcr with  chroma subsampling the choice of formats affects the producers licensingroyalty costs as well as the titles maximum run time due to differences in compression efficiency discs encoded in mpeg video typically limit content producers to around two hours of highdefinition content on a singlelayer  gb bdrom the moreadvanced video formats vc and mpeg avc typically achieve a video run time twice that of mpeg with comparable quality mpeg was used by many studios including paramount pictures which initially used the vc format for hd dvd releases for the first series of bluray discs which were launched throughout  modern releases are now often encoded in either mpeg avc or vc allowing film studios to place all content on one disc reducing costs and improving ease of use using these formats also frees a lot of space for storage of bonus content in hd ip as opposed to the sd ip typically used for most titles some studios such as warner bros have released bonus content on discs encoded in a different format than the main feature title for example the bluray disc release of superman returns uses vc for the feature film and mpeg for some of its bonus content today warner and other studios typically provide bonus content in the video format that matches the feature audioedit for audio bdrom players are required to implement dolby digital ac dts and linear

sun microsystems java crossplatform software environment would be included in all bluray disc players as a mandatory part of the standard java is used to implement interactive menus on bluray discs as opposed to the method used on dvdvideo discs dvds use prerendered mpeg segments and selectable subtitle pictures which are considerably more primitive and rarely seamless at the conference java creator james gosling suggested that the inclusion of a java virtual machine as well as network connectivity in some bd devices will allow updates to bluray discs via the internet adding content such as additional subtitle languages and promotional features not included on the disc at pressing time this java version is called bdj and is built on a profile of the globally executable mhp gem standard gem is the worldwide version of the multimedia home platform standard player profilesedit the bdrom specification defines four bluray disc player profiles including an audioonly player

profile  players it is able to play the main feature of the disc but some extra features may not be available or will have limited capability bdliveedit the biggest difference between bonus view and bdlive is that bdlive requires the bluray disc player to have an internet connection to access internetbased content bdlive features have included internet chats scheduled chats with the director internet games downloadable featurettes downloadable quizzes and downloadable movie trailers note that while some bonus view players may have an ethernet port these are used for firmware updates and are not used for internetbased content in addition profile  also requires more local storage in order to handle this content profile  players are not eligible for bonus view or bdlive compliant upgrades and do not have the function or capability to access these upgrades with the exception of the latest players and the playstation  internet is required to use region codesedit regions for the bluray disc standard   region a   region b   region c as with the implementation of region codes for dvds bluray disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region this is intended to permit content providers motion picture studios television production company etc to do effective price differentiation between regions according to the bluray disc association all bluray disc players and bluray discequipped computer systems are required to enforce regional coding however content providers need not use region playback codes some current estimates suggest  of available movie bluray discs from the major studios are regioncodefree and can therefore be played on any bluray disc player in any region movie distributors have different region coding policies among major us studios walt disney pictures warner bros paramount pictures universal studios and sony pictures have released most of their titles regionfree mgm and lions gate entertainment have released a mix of regionfree and regioncoded titles th century fox has released most of their titles regioncoded vintage film restoration and distribution company the criterion collection uses us region coding in all bluray releases the bluray disc region coding scheme divides the world into three regions labeled a b and c region code area a the americas and their dependencies taiwan hong kong macau japan korea and southeast asia excludes instances that fall under region c b africa middle east southwest asia most of europe united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland australia new zealand and their dependencies excludes instances that fall under region c c central asia mainland china mongolia south asia belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan moldova and the aforementioned regions dependencies free informal term meaning worldwide region free is not an official setting discs that bear the region free symbol either have no flags set or have all three flags set abc in circumvention of region coding restrictions standalone bluray disc players are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of bluray discs and dvds with any region code instructions hacks describing how to reset the bluray region counter of computer player applications to make them multiregion indefinitely are also regularly posted to video enthusiast websites and forums unlike dvd region codes bluray region codes are verified only by the player software not by the optical drives firmware the latest type of bluray discs suitable for ultrahd k resolution content are regionfree digital rights managementedit the bluray disc format employs several layers of digital rights management drm which restrict the usage of the discs this has led to extensive criticism of the format by organizations opposed to drm such as the free software foundation and consumers because new releases require player firmware updates to allow disc playback highbandwidth digital content protectionedit bluray equipment is required to implement the highbandwidth digital content protection hdcp system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections this is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it travels across cables through a protocol flag in the media stream called the image constraint token ict a bluray disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full hdcpcompliant link is not used in order to ease the transition to high definition formats the adoption of this protection method was postponed until  advanced access content systemedit the aacs decryption process the advanced access content system aacs is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management it was developed by as licensing administrator llc aacs la a consortium that includes disney intel microsoft panasonic warner bros ibm toshiba and sony since the appearance of the format on devices in  several successful attacks have been made on it the first known attack relied on the trusted client problem in addition decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player windvd since keys can be revoked in newer releases this is only a temporary attack and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs bdedit bd was developed by cryptography research inc and is based on their concept of selfprotecting digital content bd effectively a small virtual machine embedded in authorized players allows content providers to include executable programs on bluray discs such programs can examine the host environment to see if the player has been tampered with every licensed playback device manufacturer must provide the bd licensing authority with memory footprints that identify their devices verify that the players keys have not been changed execute native code possibly to patch an otherwise insecure system transform the audio and video output parts of the content will not be viewable without letting the bd program unscramble it if a playback device manufacturer finds that its devices have been hacked it can potentially release bd code that detects and circumvents the vulnerability these programs can then be included in all new content releases the specifications of the bd virtual machine are available only to licensed device manufacturers a list of licensed commercial adopters is available from the bd website the first titles using bd were released in october  since november  versions of bd protection have been circumvented by various versions of the anydvd hd program other programs known to be capable of circumventing bd protection are dumphd versions  and above along with some supporting software makemkv and two applications from dvdfab passkey and hd decrypter bdrom markedit bdrom mark is a small amount of cryptographic data that is stored separately from normal bluray disc data aiming to prevent replication of the discs the cryptographic data is needed to decrypt the copyrighted disc content protected by aacs a specially licensed piece of hardware is required to insert the rommark into the media during mastering during replication this rom mark is transferred together with the recorded data to the disc in consequence any copies of a disc made with a regular recorder will lack the rommark data and will be unreadable on standard players backward compatibilityedit the bluray disc association recommends but does not require that bluray disc drives be capable of reading standard dvds and cds for backward compatibility most bluray disc players are capable of reading both cds and dvds however a few of the early bluray disc players released in  such as the sony bdps could play dvds but not cds variationsedit high fidelity pure audio bdaedit main article high fidelity pure audio high fidelity pure audio hfpa is a marketing initiative spearheaded by the universal music group for audioonly bluray optical discs launched in  as a potential successor to the compact disc it has been compared with dvda and sacd which had similar aims avchdedit main article avchd avchd was originally developed as a high definition format for consumer tapeless camcorders derived from the bluray disc specification avchd shares a similar random access directory structure but is restricted to lower audio and video bitrates simpler interactivity and the use of avcvideo and dolby ac or linear pcm audio being primarily an acquisition format avchd playback is not recognized by all devices that play bluray disc nevertheless many such devices are capable of playing avchd recordings from removable media such as dvds sdsdhc memory cards memory stick cards and hard disk drives avcrecedit main article avcrec avcrec uses a bdav container to record high definition content on conventional dvds presently avcrec is tightly integrated with the japanese isdb broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of japan avcrec is used primarily in settop digital video recorders and in this regard is comparable to hd rec bluray dedit the bluray d logo the bluray disc association bda created a task force made up of executives from the film industry and the consumer electronics and it sectors to help define standards for putting d film and d television content on a bluray disc on december   the bda officially announced d specs for bluray disc allowing backward compatibility with current d bluray players the bda has said the bluray d specification calls for encoding d video using the stereo high profile defined by multiview video coding mvc an extension to the itut h advanced video coding avc codec currently implemented by all bluray disc players mpegmvc compresses both left and right eye views with a typical  overhead compared to equivalent d content and can provide full p resolution backward compatibility with current d bluray disc players this means the mvc d stream is backward compatible with havc d stream allowing older d devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams ignoring additional information for the second view sony added bluray d support to its playstation  console via a firmware upgrade on  september  the console had previously gained d gaming capability via an update on  april  since the version  software update in august   the playstation  can play dtshd master audio and dtshd high resolution audio while playing d bluray dolby truehd is used on a small minority of bluray d releases and bitstreaming
