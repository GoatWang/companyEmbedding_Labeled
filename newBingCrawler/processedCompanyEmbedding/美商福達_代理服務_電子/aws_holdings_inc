holdings case study about signature group holdings signature group holdings inc is a diversified business and financial services enterprise that invests in the industrial and commercial marketplace primarily in the united states signature focuses on generating strong riskadjusted return on equity while protecting shareholder capital the company also supplies commercial industrial and residential circuit breakers to the replacement market through its subsidiary north american breaker company signature group holdings is based in sherman oaks california the challenge as a consulting firm signature holdings has a very small it department the company has a few dedicated network and systems engineers but most of the staff members who support it have other responsibilities as a result signature works with several service providers for it support including computer technology resources ctr a member of the amazon partner network apn when signature decided to replace its outdated onpremises erp system with oracle ebusiness suite the company turned to ctr for the implementation signature wanted a soxcompliant environment that could be managed by a service provider and integrate into its existing infrastructure with minimum disruption signature also wanted a disaster recovery solution that would enable fast recovery why amazon web services after reviewing options signature decided to implement the oracle ebusiness suite for signature on the cloud “oracle applications have a complex architecture requiring multiple servers and disaster recovery” says karlo vartan vice president of finance and information “planning and purchasing hardware would have been a huge upfront investment which signature wanted to avoid” ctr works with several cloud providers and chose amazon web services aws for this project because of the maturity of aws and the ability to customize amazon machine images amis amazon elastic compute cloud amazon ec instances and other features security is a primary concern for signature and sox auditors perform security quarterly checks “we were satisfied that aws security features and capabilities would enable the company to pass the financial and technological audit says vartan” implementing oracle on the aws cloud to set up oracle financial modules on aws for signature ctr provisioned an amazon virtual private network amazon vpc to run the oracle ebusiness suite accounts payable accounts receivable oracle asset management and procuretopay on two extralarge amazon ec instances amazon elastic block store amazon ebs provides highperformance blocklevel storage for the instances the storage volumes initially stored  gb of data which has since grown to  gb over a period of  months oracle recovery manager rman a database backup and recovery manager interfaces with amazon simple storage service amazon s to enable secure database backups for disaster recovery the primary environment runs in the us east northern region and has a backup site in the us west northern california region figure  below demonstrates the oracle applications on aws figure  oracle ebusiness suite on aws for signature holdings “because of connectors between aws and oracle we can launch an oracle application from the aws console or from an oracle application” says sam palani director of ctr’s infrastructure  cloud solutions team “for example you can run backups from the aws console or if you’re in the oracle system rman actually creates and deletes amazon s images as needed it’s a pretty seamless process other cloud providers don’t have these types of connectors — it makes management on aws much easier than other solutions” the benefits by using aws signature was able to launch a complex financial system in six weeks oracle ebusiness suite has a much larger footprint than signature’s legacy system and running on aws helped signature avoid the time and resources of onpremises implementation vartan says “when we look at the total cost of ownership for oracle ebusiness suite over three years aws is about onethird the cost of an onpremises solution the best part is that we’ve never had any downtime or system crashes running oracle on aws — we’ve had about  percent availability” sox auditors examine both the financial and technological aspects of the oracle implementation on aws focusing on security backup and disaster recovery for the last three years signature and ctr has successfully passed the quarterly audits when signature wants to test a proof of concept using the oracle erp it’s easy to create a sandbox by spinning up an instance with a subset of production data “if signature decides to go ahead with the project the ctr team can merge the project into the production environment if not they can shut down the instance” says palani “it avoids the overhead of tying up servers to test an idea or for development requests” signature uses production data for detailed reporting and on the aws cloud it’s easy to spin up an amazon ec instance to run the report “we run the instances in parallel so everyday business functions can continue without interruption” says palani “we make sure that the data is synched between the instances so that the reporting was accurate” “running our oracle applications on aws gives us the agility and flexibility to focus on what we do best” says vartan “from the very beginning i knew that we had made the right decision in trusting aws and ctr to manage our oracle business applications running on the aws cloud and having ctr manage the underlying technology enables signature to put our business at the forefront” about the partner computer technology resources a global system integration company dedicated to providing high quality and cost
