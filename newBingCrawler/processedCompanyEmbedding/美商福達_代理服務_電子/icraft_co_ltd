transmit the additional information  in a code form recognized from the video data to the service server  and may compare the information included by performing decoding processing in the service server  thereby determining whether or not the additional information  is authenticfurthermore the additional information and spectrum comparing part  determines whether or not the spectrum separated from the still image data is authentic thereby outputting information about whether or not the optical material is authentic at this time the spectrum separated from the still image data is a spectrum included in a wavelength reflected from the optical material  due to flashing of the user terminal  entered into the optical material  in a step in which the data obtaining unit  obtains the still imagein one example when the wavelength of the spectrum extracted from the still image is compared with wavelengths of the optical material  that is a genuine product to be applied on the genuine product certification means  stored in the service server  if these wavelengths are consistent with each other the additional information and spectrum comparing part  outputs a result indicating that the corresponding optical material  is determined to be authentichowever at this time when the corresponding wavelength included in the optical material  is not detected in the service server  or is not consistent with the wavelengths of the optical material applied on the corresponding genuine product certification means  the additional information and spectrum comparing part  outputs a result indicating that the corresponding optical material  is determined not to be authenticin the present embodiment when a wavelength extracted from the still image data for processing the spectrum is  nm and the wavelengths of the optical material of a genuine product stored in the service server are  nm nm nm since the extracted wavelength of  nm is included in the range of the wavelengths of the optical material  that is a genuine product the corresponding optical material  is determined as a genuine productin the same vein in the case where the additional information and spectrum comparing unit  extracts a wavelength of  nm from the still image data and the wavelength of the optical material which is a genuine product stored in the service server  is in the range from  nm to  nm since the extracted wavelength of  nm is included in the range of the wavelength of the optical material  the corresponding optical material  is determined as a genuine productas such the data comparing unit  includes the obtained data processing part  the pattern comparing part  and the additional information and spectrum comparing part  thereby receiving the video data and still image data obtained from the data obtaining unit  and determining whether or not the patterns  the additional information  and the optical material  are authentic by comparing the video data and still image data with the existing data stored in the service server  based on the result the data comparing unit  determines whether or not the genuine product certification means  is authenticfurthermore the data comparing
