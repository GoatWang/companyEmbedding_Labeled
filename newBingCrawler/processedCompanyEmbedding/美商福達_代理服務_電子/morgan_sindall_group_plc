sindall is a leading uk construction and regeneration group they employ around  people they operate in both the public and private sector their activities include working on everything from small scale fit outs affordable housing to major urban regeneration schemes used to operate on the london stock exchange in  recorded a turnover of £ million in  business cyclethe business cycle is the phases of growth and decline in an economy the goal of economic policy is to keep the economy in a healthy growth rate  fast enough to create jobs for everyone who wants one but slow enough to avoid inflation there are four phases that describe the business cycle at any point in time you are in one of these stagesfour stages boom – this is when the economy is growing quickly demand in the economy is high and consumer spending grows business production increases to keep up with the demand downturn – growth starts to slow down consumer spending begins to fall and businesses invest less in capital equipment there is uncertainty about the future of the economy recession – a continued downturn in economic activity can lead to a recession demand is low and firms may struggle to survive recovery – gdp starts to rise again as consumer spending increases and businesses produce more goods and serviceshow morgan sindall plc is affected by each stage of the business cyclegovernment policies that impinge businesses cont goalmorgan sindall group zak and nabeelpolicies are created by the government they are then used and developed in order to influence the uk economy theses policies influence the way businesses operate government polices that affect businesses are economic policyindustrial policycompetition policyfiscal policysocial policyeducation and training policytransport policyeconomic policy  these are policies that the government has to deal with such as economic growth unemployment and inflation economic growth is very important to governments as it means that the living standards of the population increases the benefits of good standards of living are people bringing in an income increased demand for products and services revenues from taxes and low rates of unemployment leading to less poverty industrial policy  this relates to government policy that is designed to enhance and increase industry in the uk this is linked with the economic policy as a whole but focuses more on jobs and skills industrial policy outlines the key ways that the government wants to support rising incomes low carbon economies and greater efficiency new technologies and demographic changes competition policy  government policy towards competition also has a big influence on the economy the government believes competition brings a number of different benefits including the good use of the economys resources through enterprise and efficiency and good performance on pricing quality and choice the policy also makes sure that one or two businesses do not dominate a market and that the competition is as fair as possible fiscal policy  fiscal policy covers the spending and taxation decisions of a government governments can change tax rates the type of taxes that they impose and what they decide to tax the aim of fiscal policy is to influence the total demand for goods and services in an economy by increasing the governments own spending andor by reducing taxessocial policy  social policy means the policies that the uk government put in place for welfare and social protection it relates to social services and the welfare state it links to the economic environment because it relates to issues such as health employment community care housing crime and social disadvantage education and training policy  government policy on education has a very large impact on the way that businesses operate and the level of skills in the population education and training policy will dictate the type of qualifications that are studied and which qualifications money is invested in it also includes support for different types of training such as literacy and numeracy skills as well as funding for students wanting to study in higher education transport policy  this policy covers road air train and shipping transport policy ensures that the uk has good transport systems that help businesses operate as efficiently and effectively as possible contgovernment policies that have impacted morgan sindallimpact of changes to government spending on morgan sindall the level of government spending has many effects on businesses including morgan sindall for morgan sindall a firm providing their services to the government and other firmsincreased government spending may mean higher taxeshigher taxes reduce the ability of customers to purchase goods and services which is likely to reduce consumer spending many businesses including morgan sindall rely on government spending for their revenues and profits this means that demand is directly linked to how much the government is spending this includesconstruction firms that build and repair the road networkconstruction for new schools and collegeslevel of government funding for apprenticeshipscontthe multiplier effect is when there is an increase in spending produces an increase in national income and consumption greater than the initial amount spend when one thing happens it basically sets off a chain of reactions affecting a load of different businesses and organizations an example of the multiplier effect in morgan sinadall is if for example the government invested a large amount of money into constructing a solid transportation system to a remote village this may set off a chain reaction such as employing construction workers and suppliers for raw materials as well indirectly the transportation system will provide businesses in the area with better links to the outside world allowing people to travel to outside the village faster eg people can travel to work more efficiently and faster it also allows people to enter the village better and quicker increasing spending and tourism in the area it can also allow supplies for businesses to arrive quicker which will help stimulate demand and the level of employment will increase massively resulting in helping benefit the villages local economy and the countrys gdp as a whole the changing levels of demand across the cyclein a boom phase aggregate demand is high and businesses expand output and employment and may also raise profit margins by increasing prices  causing costpush and demandpull inflation this means that morgan sindall will be affected by a number of changes in demand level such as a high demand for imports this will be important for morgan sindall because importing more construction tools and equipment allows them to keep pace with the high demandalthough it means that prices for importing costs will be higher particularly during the boom period this will mean more construction contracts for morgan sindall however because of a high aggregate demand ms they can invest more of their spending on capital goods during an economic downturn growth starts to slow down this means that consumer spending will lessen morgan sindall will start to struggle as they might receive less building contracts in some cases contracts may be postponed halfway because of stall in payments continuedin a recession companies will struggle for longer periods because demand will be very low and smaller businesses will struggle to survive morgan sindall will suffer during a recession because they are considered a more quality brand therefore consumers will defer to less quality and more inferior products and brands meaning morgan sindall being a high value product will be substituted because of a shift in demandduring an economic recovery business activity will increase as gdp begins to rise meaning businesses will begin to produce more goods and services for morgan sindall it will mean more longterm building contracts engineering expertise etcripple effectthe ripple effect is the notion that a single action has an effect over several different entities an internal example of how a business such as morgan sindall can benefit from the ripple effect is in personnel management before making any personnel moves the ripple effect of that employee no longer being at their job needs to be considered for instance morgan sindall might decide to lay off one of their construction workers this might lead to a ripple effect of workers becoming uncertain and affect their ability to be productive indicators of recovery that the managers of the company should look out forthere are a number of indicators of economic recovery that managers should look out for decline in unemployment is one of the main indicators that economy is recovering it means that more people are working earning money producing goods and spending money managers in morgan sindall can look out for this indicator and hire more staffa rise in the value of the £ can mean that it is worth more compared to other currencies for instance if morgan sindall wants to import equipment material from other parts of europe it means that with a stronger currency they can purchase the items for cheaper continuedan increase in factory production is a good sign of economic recovery manufacturing in the uk represents more than  of the total gross domestic product gdp this is a good sign for morgan sindall managers to look out for as it means with an increase in manufacturing also means an opportunity for them to expand their manufacturing reach how the changing employment levels at the stages will affect the firmthe employment rate is one of the economic indicators that economists examine to help understand the state of the economy during a boom employment levels will be high whereas during recession unemployment levels will be high during an economic boom morgan sindall are more likely to have less chance of employing suitable staff members this may be because there may not be suitable people looking for work during high unemployment levels people may not be able to afford and buy goods from businesses and so morgan sindall revenue income may fall the likely impact of periods of high and low inflation on the businessinflation levels may arise during economic boom resulting in wage increase requests from workers making it harder for morgan sindall to manage costs the unexpected rise of inflation is generally considered the most painful as it takes companies several quarters to be able to pass along higher input costs to consumershigh inflation can be good as it can stimulate some job growth but high inflation can also impact businesses such as morgan sindall profits through higher input costs this causes corporations to worry about the future and stop hiring negatively impacting the standard of living of individuals cont with the environmental policy set out by the government it declares that public sector procurers and suppliers of timber must comply with the timber procurement policy the policy states that specified public sector procurers must buy all timber and wood derived products from only independent verifiable and sustainable this results in higher costs for the business as sustainable timber is normally more expensive than unregulated logged timber without any legal procedures taking place sustainable timber means that the timber has to be cut environmentally efficiently and that they do not cut excess timber they plant extra trees in compensation for the logged ones and make sure they avoid trees that animals are residing inso there are a lot of regulations for this policy resulting in higher costs however in the long term it will benefit the environment and will result in a positive reputation for morgan sindall as it shows that they are caring for the environment as a major uk construction and infrastructure company morgan sindall is clear in the leadership role that they must fulfill in driving forward the industrys sustainability performance morgan sindall have a thing called the total commitment to sustainability which is split into three pillars of people planet and profit which each contain two specific objectives this has led to an improvement in their sustainability performance in recent years and delivery of tangible benefits to their customers and society specifically we are concerned with the impact is had on the the planet morgan sindall say our aspiration is to benefit the environment in its widest sense and to reduce negative environmental impact as far as practical their two specific objectives for their ethical work on the planet are reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions and to reduce waste sustainbale logging is linked to morgan sindall because sustainability touches on every aspect of our business this has been said directly by the chief executive of morgan sindall john morgan john morgan believes maximising shareholder value over the long term is best achieved through an intelligent regard for all our stakeholders and by acting with integrity and responsibility from this you can tell that from the very top of their organisation to the bottom morgan sindall as an organisation care for the envinromnent and will act in the best interest of the planet and their stakeholders it is obvious why morgan sindall are bothered about logs because their business is in the constuction industry and they use a lot or raw materials for their projects which includes wood due to the existing concerns about unethical logging it puts morgan sindall in a tough psoition in order to preserve their brand and satisfy their stakeholders it is important they stay active in caring for the enviroment and pusue iniatives that will help preserve and help benfit it aswell this is evident from the policies morgan sindall enforced concerning logging another policy that has impacted morgan sindall is the transport policy government transport policy consists of policies for transport that are designed to support the transport network that helps the uk’s businesses and gets people and goods traveling around the country the government plan and invest in transport infrastructure to keep the uk on the move the five government objectives for transport concern environment safety economy accessibility and integration the department of transport’s aim is ‘better transport’ and supporting objectives are a ‘reliable safe and integrated transport for everyone which respects the environment’ the government’s decision of making it compulsory that contractors follow their five point objectives has helped the environment businesses and the people as a whole a massive project that morgan sindall contributed to was the ‘m completion project’ which has benefited glasgow and the surrounding areas massively the m completion project passes through south east glasgow and comprises eight kilometers of dual three lane motorway funded by transport scotland and a few other local councils the scheme completes a missing link in the west of scotland’s motorway network linking the existing m to the m motorway and providing an alternative strategic route across glasgow bringing significant benefits to transport links this was a £ million construction contract delivered by morgan sindall and a variety of different construction companies including balfour beatty morrison construction and others the construction has helped glasgow and the surrounding areas because during the project has directly supported up to  jobs within the construction industry with  per cent of those employed being from the immediate area also extensive landscape planting was undertaken alongside the motorway including more than  trees and shrubs and over  native ground cover plants to soften the effect of the new motorway enhance biodiversity and produce habitats for native species so the construction of the motorway has benefited businesses people and the environment as a whole government projects private workmorgan sindall are awarded a number of projects on an annual basis morgan sindall group plc secures position on £m redevelopment framework for bae systems they received this on november  britain at this point were coming out of a recession therefore they received the project during the boom period this means that morgan sindall generally receive their projects when the economy is coming out of the recession morgan sindall forestry policiesthe forestry commission has set out guidelines on sustainable logging in the uk woodland sector the fc objective is to enable the forestry sector to protect improve and expand this asset so that these benefits can be maximised now and maintained for the future fc forestry policy is therefore based on resilience morgan sindall need to ensure that their constructions will not affect the woodland areas the morgan sindall group is committed to ensuring the effects of its operation on people and the planet are minimised morgan sindall intend to deliver their policy on sustainable sourcing of timbre and timbre fibre products they are also committed to ensuring that timber fibre products wood raw material has been manufactured in a legal and sustainable manner
