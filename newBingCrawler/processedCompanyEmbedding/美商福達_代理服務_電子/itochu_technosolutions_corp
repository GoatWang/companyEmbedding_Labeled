manufacturing co ltdntt data intellilink corporation itochu technosolutions corporation satoshi kikuchi president  ceo headquartered in chiyodaku tokyo murata manufacturing co ltd tsuneo murata president and representative director headquartered in nagaokakyoshi kyoto hereinafter “murata manufacturing” and ntt data intellilink corporation kou miyake president and ceo headquartered in chuoku tokyo hereinafter “ntt data intellilink” will jointly develop a dedicated rack system that is compliant with the specifications of the open compute project hereinafter “the ocp” a project that promotes open specifications for facilities such as data centers as well as hardware murata manufacturing will be responsible for the design and manufacture of the power unit incorporating the technology of the centralized power system owned by ntt data intellilink itochu technosolutions corporation will incorporate customer needs in japan for developing the specifications of the dedicated rack system the rack will be produced by multiple rack manufacturers of japan reasons why the ocp dedicated rack system is required ocp is a project started by facebook inc in  to design the best hardware for largescale data centers more than  companies participating in the project worldwide are moving forward to design the specification for datacenter in the hyperscale environment since the ocp dedicated rack system is designed with unites states standard it becomes too large in size height depth and has supported the phase power input compare to the conventional singlephase power mainly supported in japan this makes the ocp standard rack costing more than the traditional inch rack in order to use ocpcompliant hardware in japanese datacenters the power source rack size and cost issues have to be solved and an earthquakeresistant design needs to be implemented itochu technosolutions corporation’s role in developing the ocp dedicated rack system itochu technosolutions corporation concluded the solution provider agreement with the open compute project foundation in january  and became the first solution provider in japan itochu technosolutions corporation provides hardware sales system integration maintenance support and operational support services since  it has also been providing the open cloud package a solution for nextgeneration it infrastructure using ocp certified hardware and multiple open source software oss including openstack in developing the dedicated rack system compatible with the ocp itochu technosolutions corporation has designed the rack system to meet the needs of japanese datacenters based on the experience it has gained through the proposals and deliveries to the customers in addition to the ocp compliant hardware sales system integration maintenance support and operational support services itochu technosolutions corporation will offer ocp dedicated rack system integrated with server storage and network as a total solution murata manufacturing’s role in developing the ocp dedicated rack system murata manufacturing have been engaged in the development production and distribution of centralized power supplies for data centers that are mounted in inch standard racks and also working on developing highpowered lithium ion batteries murata manufacturing also joined the ocp which has attracted a great deal of interest throughout the industry in recent years and has been working on the possibilities of supporting this project by combining the murata manufacturing’s accumulated knowledge regarding the centralized power source technology lithiumion battery related technology with itochu technosolutions corporation and ntt data intellilink’s solution murata manufacturing is working to develop the power shelves that include highly efficient and high quality power supplies and lithiumion batteries the company will help to reduce the cost of datacenter operation by providing highly efficient and highly reliable ocp compatible power shelves using the centralized power source system with highly efficient and high quality power supplies as well as lithiumion batteries made in house ntt data intellilink’s role in developing the ocp dedicated rack system ntt data intellilink delivers the centralized power system solution to cut down the power consumption of server rack systems this solution offers a very efficient power source mythology by removing power supplies from individual it devices and centralizing the power supplies in the server rack by doing so this improves  to  power efficiency for each server rack ntt data intellilink owns patents for the technologies that optimally control the number of centralized power supplies and also the use of batteries to respond to the peak demand of it devices using these technologies ntt data intellilink will provide the solution that supports both inch rack and ocp dedicated rack in addition this solution with high voltage direct current hvdc input to the centralized power supplies will provide an excellent energysaving highly reliable and safe system compare to the traditional ups systems features of the ocp dedicated rack system the ocp dedicated rack system supports ocp certified products this rack improves power efficiency by performing acdc conversion through the centralized power supplies which supplies dc power to servers storage devices and network devices via busbars countries around the world use different power transmission systems and voltages in the united states ocp standard rack is mostly used with v or v phase wire system however it has been difficult to deploy ocp standard racks in japan where a v or v singlephase system or a v phase wire system is generally used the ocp dedicated rack system will offer not only phase wire system but also the choice from phase wire  singlephase and high voltage direct current hvdc system with highlevel of efficiency this allows deploying the ocp product in traditional japanese datacenter much easier the height and depth of the rack system will also be modified to the commonly used size in japan while discussions are being held to set the price range at  of the ocp standard rack currently being sold  date of release the sample power supplies and the shelf will release in august  and production model will be in march  the multipurpose

 “power supply system”  the united states and europe generally use a phase wire system in which phase electric power is transmitted via  cables in contrast there are countries and regions such as japan and the philippines that use a phase wire system in which phase power is provided via  cables in addition although they use the same system the united states uses mainly voltages close to v while europe uses those in the neighborhood of v as these examples show different systems and voltages are used depending on the country and region     specifications in terms of the rack not those of
