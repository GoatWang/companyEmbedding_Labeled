and banking finance corporate personal public v t e in finance an option is a contract which gives the buyer the owner or holder of the option the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specific strike price on a specified date depending on the form of the option the strike price may be set by reference to the spot price market price of the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out or it may be fixed at a discount in a premium the seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction—to sell or buy—if the buyer owner exercises the option an option that conveys to the owner the right to buy at a specific price is referred to as a call an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell at a specific price is referred to as a put both are commonly used in and by the old traded but the call option is more frequently discussed the seller may grant an option to a buyer as part of another transaction such as a share issue or as part of an employee incentive scheme otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option a call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value when an option is exercised the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium if any when the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller in any case the premium is income to the seller and normally a capital loss to the buyer the owner of an option may onsell the option to a third party in a secondary market in either an overthecounter transaction or on an options exchange depending on the option the market price of an americanstyle option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock being the difference between the market price of the stock and the strike price of the option the actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding the ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset such as a dividend

times the first reputed option buyer was the ancient greek mathematician and philosopher thales of miletus on a certain occasion it was predicted that the seasons olive harvest would be larger than usual and during the offseason he acquired the right to use a number of olive presses the following spring when spring came and the olive harvest was larger than expected he exercised his options and then rented the presses out at a much higher price than he paid for his option in london puts and refusals calls first became wellknown trading instruments in the s during the reign of william and mary privileges were options sold over the counter in nineteenth century america with both puts and calls on shares offered by specialized dealers their exercise price was fixed at a roundedoff market price on the day or week that the option was bought and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase they were not traded in secondary markets in the real estate market call options have long been used to assemble large parcels of land from separate owners eg a developer pays for the right to buy several adjacent plots but is not obligated to buy these plots and might not unless he can buy all the plots in the entire parcel film or theatrical producers often buy the right — but not the obligation — to dramatize a specific book or script lines of credit give the potential borrower the right — but not the obligation — to borrow within a specified time period many choices or embedded options have traditionally been included in bond contracts for example many bonds are convertible into common stock at the buyers option or may be called bought back at specified prices at the issuers option mortgage borrowers have long had the option to repay the loan early which corresponds to a callable bond option modern stock optionsedit options contracts have been known for decades the chicago board options exchange was established in  which set up a regime using standardized forms and terms and trade through a guaranteed clearing house trading activity and academic interest has increased since then today many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated options exchanges while other overthecounter options are written as bilateral customized contracts between a single buyer and seller one or both of which may be a dealer or marketmaker options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as derivative products or simply derivatives contract specificationsedit a financial option is a contract between two counterparties with the terms of the option specified in a term sheet option contracts may be quite complicated however at minimum they usually contain the following specifications whether the option holder has the right to buy a call option or the right to sell a put option the quantity and class of the underlying assets eg  shares of xyz co b stock the strike price also known as the exercise price which is the price at which the underlying transaction will occur upon exercise the expiration date or expiry which is the last date the option can be exercised the settlement terms for instance whether the writer must deliver the actual asset on exercise or may simply tender the equivalent cash amount the terms by which the option is quoted in the market to convert the quoted price into the actual premium – the total amount paid by the holder to the writer option tradingedit forms of tradingedit exchangetraded optionsedit exchangetraded options also called listed options are a class of exchangetraded derivatives exchange traded options have standardized contracts and in the united states are settled through a clearing house with fulfillment guaranteed by the options clearing corporation occ since the contracts are standardized accurate pricing models are often available to understand which option is being traded a standardised option naming convention has been developed by the exchanges that shows the expiry month and strike price using special letter codes exchangetraded options include stock options bond options and other interest rate options stock market index options or simply index options and options on futures contracts callable bullbear contract overthecounter optionsedit overthecounter options otc options also called dealer options are traded between two private parties and are not listed on an exchange the terms of an otc option are unrestricted and may be individually tailored to meet any business need in general the option writer is a wellcapitalized institution in order to prevent the credit risk option types commonly traded over the counter include interest rate options currency cross rate options and options on swaps or swaptions by avoiding an exchange users of otc options can narrowly tailor the terms of the option contract to suit individual business requirements in addition otc option transactions generally do not need to be advertised to the market and face little or no regulatory requirements however otc counterparties must establish credit lines with each other and conform to each others clearing and settlement procedures with few exceptions there are no secondary markets for employee stock options these must either be exercised by the original grantee or allowed to expire exchange tradingedit the most common way to trade options is via standardized options contracts that are listed by various futures and options exchanges  listings and prices are tracked and can be looked up by ticker symbol by publishing continuous live markets for option prices an exchange enables independent parties to engage in price discovery and execute transactions as an intermediary to both sides of the transaction the benefits the exchange provides to the transaction include fulfillment of the contract is backed by the credit of the exchange which typically has the highest rating aaa counterparties remain anonymous enforcement of market regulation to ensure fairness and transparency and maintenance of orderly markets especially during fast trading conditions basic trades american styleedit these trades are described from the point of view of a speculator if they are combined with other positions they can also be used in hedging an option contract in us markets usually represents  shares of the underlying security long calledit payoff from buying a call a trader who expects a stocks price to increase can buy a call option to purchase the stock at a fixed price strike price at a later date rather than purchase the stock outright the cash outlay on the option is the premium the trader would have no obligation to buy the stock but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date the risk of loss would be limited to the premium paid unlike the possible loss had the stock been bought outright the holder of an american style call option can sell his option holding at any time until the expiration date and would consider doing so when the stocks spot price is above the exercise price especially if he expects the price of the option to drop by selling the option early in that situation the trader can realise an immediate profit alternatively he can exercise the option — for example if there is no secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock realising a profit a trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium for example if the exercise price is  and premium paid is  then if the spot price of  rises to only  the transaction is breakeven an increase in stock price above  produces a profit if the stock price at expiration is lower than the exercise price the holder of the options at that time will let the call contract expire and only lose the premium or the price paid on transfer long putedit payoff from buying a put a trader who expects a stocks price to decrease can buy a put option to sell the stock at a fixed price strike price at a later date the trader will be under no obligation to sell the stock but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date if the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid he will make a profit if the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid in the transaction the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the breakeven point for example if exercise price is  premium paid is  then a spot price of  to  is not profitable he would make a profit if the spot price is below  it is important to note that one who exercises a put option does not necessarily need to own the underlying asset specifically one does not need to own the underlying stock in order to sell it the reason for this is that one can short sell that underlying stock short calledit payoff from writing a call a trader who expects a stocks price to decrease can sell the stock short or instead sell or write a call the trader selling a call has an obligation to sell the stock to the call buyer at a fixed price strike price if the seller does not own the stock when the option is exercised he is obligated to purchase the stock from the market at the then market price if the stock price decreases the seller of the call call writer will make a profit in the amount of the premium if the stock price increases over the strike price by more than the amount of the premium the seller will lose money with the potential loss being unlimited short putedit payoff from writing a put a trader who expects a stocks price to increase can buy the stock or instead sell or write a put the trader selling a put has an obligation to buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price strike price if the stock price at expiration is above the strike price the seller of the put put writer will make a profit in the amount of the premium if the stock price at expiration is below the strike price by more than the amount of the premium the trader will lose money with the potential loss being up to the strike price minus the premium a benchmark index for the performance of a cashsecured short put option position is the cboe sp  putwrite index ticker put option strategiesedit main article option strategies payoffs from buying a butterfly spread payoffs from selling a straddle payoffs from a covered call combining any of the four basic kinds of option trades possibly with different exercise prices and maturities and the two basic kinds of stock trades long and short allows a variety of options strategies simple strategies usually combine only a few trades while more complicated strategies can combine several strategies are often used to engineer a particular risk profile to movements in the underlying security for example buying a butterfly spread long one x call short two x calls and long one x call allows a trader to profit if the stock price on the expiration date is near the middle exercise price x and does not expose the trader to a large loss an iron condor is a strategy that is similar to a butterfly spread but with different strikes for the short options – offering a larger likelihood of profit but with a lower net credit compared to the butterfly spread selling a straddle selling both a put and a call at the same exercise price would give a trader a greater profit than a butterfly if the final stock price is near the exercise price but might result in a large loss similar to the straddle is the strangle which is also constructed by a call and a put but whose strikes are different reducing the net debit of the trade but also reducing the risk of loss in the trade one wellknown strategy is the covered call in which a trader buys a stock or holds a previouslypurchased long stock position and sells a call if the stock price rises above the exercise price the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit if the stock price falls the call will not be exercised and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call overall the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put this relationship is known as putcall parity and offers insights for financial theory a benchmark index for the performance of a buywrite strategy is the cboe sp  buywrite index ticker symbol bxm another very common strategy is the protective put in which a trader buys a stock or holds a previouslypurchased long stock position and buys a put this strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock hedging the investors potential loses but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit if just purchasing the stock without the put the maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock the maximum loss is limited to the purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of the put option and the premium paid a protective put is also known as a married put typesedit options can be classified in a few ways according to the option rightsedit call options give the holder the right—but not the obligation—to buy something at a specific price for a specific time period put options give the holder the right—but not the obligation—to sell something at a specific price for a specific time period according to the underlying assetsedit equity option bond option future option index option commodity option currency option other option typesedit another important class of options particularly in the us are employee stock options which are awarded by a company to their employees as a form of incentive compensation other types of options exist in many financial contracts for example real estate options are often used to assemble large parcels of land and prepayment options are usually included in mortgage loans however many of the valuation and risk management principles apply across all financial options there are two more types of options covered and naked option stylesedit main article option style options are classified into a number of styles the most common of which are american option – an option that may be exercised on any trading day on or before expiration european option – an option that may only be exercised on expiry these are often described as vanilla options other styles include bermudan option – an option that may be exercised only on specified dates on or before expiration asian option – an option whose payoff is determined by the average underlying price over some preset time period barrier option – any option with the general characteristic that the underlying securitys price must pass a certain level or barrier before it can be exercised binary option – an allornothing option that pays the full amount if the underlying security meets the defined condition on expiration otherwise it expires exotic option – any of a broad category of options that may include complex financial structures valuation overviewedit options valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical finance in basic terms the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts the first part is the intrinsic value which is defined as the difference between the market value of the underlying and the strike price of the given option the second part is the time value which depends on a set of other factors which through a multivariable nonlinear interrelationship reflect the discounted expected value of that difference at expiration although options valuation has been studied at least since the nineteenth century the contemporary approach is based on the black–scholes model which was first published in  valuation modelsedit main article valuation of options the value of an option can be estimated using a variety of quantitative techniques based on the concept of risk neutral pricing and using stochastic calculus the most basic model is the black–scholes model more sophisticated models are used to model the volatility smile these models are implemented using a variety of numerical techniques in general standard option valuation models depend on the following factors the current market price of the underlying security the strike price of the option particularly in relation to the current market price of the underlying in the money vs out of the money the cost of holding a position in the underlying security including interest and dividends the time to expiration together with any restrictions on when exercise may occur and an estimate of the future volatility of the underlying securitys price over the life of the option more advanced models can require additional factors such as an estimate of how volatility changes over time and for various underlying price levels or the dynamics of stochastic interest rates the following are some of the principal valuation techniques used in practice to evaluate option contracts black–scholesedit main article black–scholes following early work by louis bachelier and later work by robert c merton fischer black and myron scholes made a major breakthrough by deriving a differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a nondividendpaying stock by employing the technique of constructing a risk neutral portfolio that replicates the returns of holding an option black and scholes produced a closedform solution for a european options theoretical price at the same time the model generates hedge parameters necessary for effective risk management of option holdings while the ideas behind the black–scholes model were groundbreaking and eventually led to scholes and merton receiving the swedish central banks associated prize for achievement in economics aka the nobel prize in economics the application of the model in actual options trading is clumsy because of the assumptions of continuous trading constant volatility and a constant interest rate nevertheless the black–scholes model is still one of the most important methods and foundations for the existing financial market in which the result is within the reasonable range stochastic volatility modelsedit main article heston model since the market crash of  it has been observed that market implied volatility for options of lower strike prices are typically higher than for higher strike prices suggesting that volatility is stochastic varying both for time and for the price level of the underlying security stochastic volatility models have been developed including one developed by sl heston one principal advantage of the heston model is that it can be solved in closedform while other stochastic volatility models require complex numerical methods see also sabr volatility model model implementationedit further information valuation of options once a valuation model has been chosen there are a number of different techniques used to take the mathematical models to implement the models analytic techniquesedit in some cases one can take the mathematical model and using analytical methods develop closed form solutions such as black–scholes and the black model the resulting solutions are readily computable as are their greeks although the rollgeskewhaley model applies to an american call with one dividend for other cases of american options closed form solutions are not available approximations here include baroneadesi and whaley bjerksund and stensland and others binomial tree pricing modeledit main article binomial options pricing model closely following the derivation of black and scholes john cox stephen ross and mark rubinstein developed the original version of the binomial options pricing model it models the dynamics of the options theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the options life the model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices by constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock as in the black–scholes model a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree this value can approximate the theoretical value produced by black scholes to the desired degree of precision however the binomial model is considered more accurate than black–scholes because it is more flexible eg discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps and american options can be modeled as well as european ones binomial models are widely used by professional option traders the trinomial tree is a similar model allowing for an up down or stable path although considered more accurate particularly when fewer timesteps are modelled it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex monte carlo modelsedit main article monte carlo methods for option pricing for many classes of options traditional valuation techniques are intractable because of the complexity of the instrument in these cases a monte carlo approach may often be useful rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the options value in relation to the underlying securitys price a monte carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the underlying asset each of which results in a payoff for the option the average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option note though that despite its flexibility using simulation for american styled options is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models finite difference modelsedit main article finite difference methods for option pricing the equations used to model the option are often expressed as partial differential equations see for example black–scholes equation once expressed in this form a finite difference model can be derived and the valuation obtained a number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation including explicit finite difference implicit finite difference and the cranknicholson method a trinomial tree option pricing model can be shown to be a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs – for example dividend yield risk free rate or volatility or some combination of these – that are not tractable in closed form other modelsedit other numerical implementations which have been used to value options include finite element methods additionally various short rate models have been developed for the valuation of interest rate derivatives bond options and swaptions these similarly allow for closedform latticebased and simulationbased modelling with corresponding advantages and considerations risksedit as with all securities trading options entails the risk of the options value changing over time however unlike traditional securities the return from holding an option varies nonlinearly with the value of the underlying and other factors therefore the risks associated with holding options are more complicated to understand and predict in general the change in the value of an option can be derived from itōs
