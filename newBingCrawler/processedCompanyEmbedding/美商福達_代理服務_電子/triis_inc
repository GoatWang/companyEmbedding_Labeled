compound with the formula hochcnh it is extensively used in biochemistry and molecular biology as a component of buffer solutions such as in tae and tbe buffers especially for solutions of nucleic acids it contains a primary amine and thus undergoes the reactions associated with typical amines eg condensations with aldehydes in medicine tromethamine is occasionally used as a drug given in intensive care for its properties as a buffer for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis in specific circumstances some medications are formulated as the tromethamine salt including hemabate

singlejunction ph electrodes eg silver chloride electrodes are incompatible with tris since an agtris precipitate forms which clogs the junction doublejunction electrodes are resistant to this problem and nonsilver containing electrodes are immune buffer inhibitionedit tris inhibits a number of enzymes and therefore should be used with care when studying proteins preparationedit tris is prepared industrially by the exhaustive condensation of nitromethane with formaldehyde under basic conditions ie repeated nitroaldol reactions to produce the intermediate hochcno which is subsequently hydrogenated to give the final product usesedit the useful buffer range for tris – coincides with the physiological ph typical of most living organisms this and its low cost make tris one of the most
