stronger more durable more corrosion and heatresistant product than is found anywhere else using a mold to create the finished product fiberglass is generally thermoset with a type of plastic or epoxy resin when cured the end product will hold its shape because of the resin while the fiberglass will provide strength and stiffness just as important the resin has additional corrosion and

energy and green codes of today going forward our innovations improve on current building energy efficiencies and indoor health environment strategies “we believe that concentrating on high performance hvac equipment only limits a complete building energy efficient strategy” said gabriel v lechuga sr founder  president of airex “therefore a detailed specification guide is now being provided thru  masterspec to assist the specifier helping to ensure the required detailed communication between the specifier and installer so that installers properly seal and protect outdoor wall penetrations and to also include outdoor refrigeration piping insulation protection as is now being mandated and required by codes”   arcom and airex manufacturing inc believe this relationship will

manufacturing inc® located in southern california and incorporated in  began by manufacturing the airex eflex guard™ protector for outdoor refrigeration piping insulation for the hvac industry thereafter the airex titan outlet™ seal for wall penetrations of refrigeration piping was innovated thru intense product engineering design premium material selection and rigorous laboratory testing

products together now known as the airex prosystem kit™ accomplishing improved sustainability energy efficiency and optimum performance of building walls hvac equipment and outdoor pipe insulation now
