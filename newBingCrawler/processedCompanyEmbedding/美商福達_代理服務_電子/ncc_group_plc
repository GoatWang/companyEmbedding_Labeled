trust domain service  creating a safe gated internet community trust will be used by organisations to protect their brand reputation and sensitive customer information   overview   the group has seen another year of tangible progress strategically operationally and financially  both trading divisions grew organically and the newly launched domain services division continues to develop its tools and services to provide a safer internet to businesses and consumers   the escrow business has developed a new saas software as a service offering for customers running systems in the cloud which offers excellent value and the strongest protection available in the global market today   in line with the groups acquisition strategy ncc group has added another small independent security testing company to its assurance division to complement its geographical presence  fortconsult based in denmark is one of the leading nordic security testing services providers  its addition will increase the groups footprint in europe and also provide customers with onestop testing services across the region   two years ago ncc group took the strategic decision to develop a third division providing domain services as part of its vision to create a safer internet for all   the group has invested heavily in the newly formed ncc group domain services division  it acquired the new generic top level domain trust subject to icann delegation processes to help accelerate the delivery of the full service   the service was launched on time and budget at the beginning of the current financial year on  june   the domain services division promises to be an exciting development for the group and one that is anticipated to show strong returns in future years   ncc groups strategy is to develop the three complementary divisions both organically and by acquisition delivering excellent service and value for money to its customers which will drive growth across the group   in the last  months group

through a complementary range of services offered to global clients to address business issues   escrow renewals are forecast to be £m  £m and the verification order book is £m  £m of which £m  £m relates to escrow europe and escrow us    the assurance divisions order books are £m  £m and with this it forecasts £m  £m of monitoring renewals for the current financial year   domain services continues to develop its systems processes and policies with a view to being able to offer a service to its customers through trust from the first half of the current financial year this complex development will always remain subject to icann timetable delays although it is currently thought that the go live date of october is likely to be achieved the expectation is that there will be at least  customers signed up by the end of the financial year  and  by  may    as stated on  june  the board expects domain services to generate revenue in the current financial year of £m increasing to around £m in the following financial year   the group expects a divisional operating loss in the order of some £m in the current financial year however this division is anticipated to make a positive contribution in the financial year to may  with a divisional margin target of approximately  thereafter   the outlook for ncc group remains extremely promising  the economic uplift will help all businesses and the progress made by domain services to date suggests that it will become a significant contributor in the coming years   with the groups strong market position and widening range of new products and services to address growing markets the board is confident that the group can continue to deliver sustainable growth and enhanced shareholder value   financial review   revenue   overall for the financial year ended  may  the group increased revenue by  to £m  £m with the revenue split being    between the first and second halves of the year    on a constant currency basis the group revenue growth would have been  as both the dollar and euro remained weak against the pound  due to the natural hedging through the intercompany loans the impact on the groups operating profits was minimal with a charge of £m being taken  the group does not speculate against currency fluctuations    escrow now accounts for  of the groups revenue   as the assurance business saw faster organic growth and benefitted from acquisitions    the groups recurring income remained significant  in escrow uk over  of all contracts renewed   assurance saw  of its revenues renewed   this now represents  of all customers    in addition    of the performance monitoring revenues renewed and are recurring   the increasing number of customers that renew in assurance has resulted in renewing assurance

with the rest of the world revenue increasing strongly to £m  £m some  of group revenue   the group continued to have minimal reliance on any one customer or sector  within assurance the largest customer represents  of assurance revenue which is  of group revenue  the largest customer in escrow is  of total escrow revenue     top three sectors by division escrow assurance software computer services   banks  insurance   telecoms     escrow     the groups escrow businesses have always been and will continue to be the cornerstone of ncc groups profitability they produce a substantial

consultancy and testing includes penetration and application security testing operational response forensics and managed monitoring along with the compliance based services such as social engineering card and information security standards and auditing  web performance testing involves continuously monitoring the performance and load capability of organisations websites   assurance revenues increased by  to £m  £m and profitability grew by  to £m  £m  the acquisition of fortconsult had less than a percentage point impact on organic growth as it was only purchased for one month of the reported period   cyber security consultancy and testing revenues grew  to £m  £m although the group ensured that utilisation rates remained at a suitably low level to combat any staff retention issues  the business unit employs  employees globally   and uses  associates   web performance had a recurring revenue rate of    which continues its strong track record of client retention  the challenge facing this business unit will be to complete the product developments and derive revenues from them in the new financial year  during the year the business area grew by   the business unit employs  employees globally     domain services  creating a safer internet  trust   in may  the group applied to register a generic top level domain gtld secure as part of the icann programme to create a new set of gtlds so as to create a universal environment for end users to operate and navigate the internet with complete safety and security   the group established a new wholly owned subsidiary in california to develop the critical infrastructure and knowhow to deliver this project  the group also decided to create a best in class registrar to serve group customers directly   up to the end of the financial year the group has invested in total £m in this project of which £m has been capitalised  during the financial year the group invested a total of £m  £m in the project of which £m  £m has been expensed as the costs were in respect of sales and marketing   during the year the group acquired the rights to the gtld trust subject to icann delegation processes and procedures in order to provide the platform from which the service could be launched  this is planned for the first half of the new financial year subject to icann process delays or slippages that may occur    the initial application for a gtld secure remains in contention as the group was one of two companies who applied for it  this will be resolved during the current financial year in accordance with icann rules   profitability and margins   ncc group continues to generate strong margins and adjusted group operating profit grew by  to £m  £m including operational expenditure of £m in domain

based on the groups net debtebitda ratio   the facility provides the group with the necessary capacity to meet its current acquisition objectives although this is regularly reviewed to ensure that unnecessary fees are not incurred due to nonutilisation  the group was utilising of the facility at the yearend   operational review   strategy   ncc group is a global information assurance specialist providing organisations worldwide with expert escrow and verification cyber security consultancy web performance software testing and domain services    the group set about building its future around the software escrow business whilst looking for new areas of growth in the then uncharted territory of information and cyber security  since then through carefully constructed controlled and sustainable organic growth along with well planned and executed strategic acquisitions the group has developed into a leading global provider in both areas   the group operates in three distinct but complementary divisions escrow assurance and domain services which do not cross sell directly but do share information intelligence and relationships to ensure that the appropriate products in its portfolio are introduced to the groups clients   all divisions are tasked with and measured on providing the best client service allied to offering appropriate services to help mitigate risk  the group is cautiously acquisitive and will remain so looking for complementary small to medium sized businesses that either further strengthen market position geographic presence andor extend the service offering   employees   the talent dedication and experience of the people employed are key to the groups success  the motivation and retention of staff remains vital for the groups future  ncc group aims to be the employer of choice  it proactively monitors staff retention and manages all aspects of individuals roles responsibilities and aspirations   escrow   the escrow division is the cornerstone of the group  the fundamentals of the group are fully encapsulated in the product which is based around the very highest standards of customer care and equitable treatment to both customers in the contractual relationship   escrow offers a high value product for a low in comparison investment  due to its importance to clients it provides the group with good recurring revenues along with good margins    the cash flow and profitability of escrow are reinvested to produce not only better escrow products and services but also other areas of complementary services to help clients mitigate their information and cyber security risks through the groups two other divisions   the group is committed to developing its escrow proposition further by providing new innovative solutions to evolve with the market  to date this has seen investments in saas and icann escrow solutions   assurance   the strategic direction and cultural philosophy of the assurance division is about evolution and so research is key to being successful in the market place information and cyber security are constantly and rapidly changing with new areas of concern or vulnerabilities frequently and regularly being discovered  to stay ahead in what has become a cyberarms race the corporate culture is aligned with this rapid and constant change  the group has created boutique ways of working and cultural values that encourage individuals to fulfil their full creative potential   apart from determining security weaknesses the group is also committed to making the internet a safer place  while combatting the threat of cybercrime is a clearly stated objective so is finding a safe way for the world to navigate communicate and transact on the internet    the divisions strategy is to constantly demand the generation of new ideas and initiatives to fulfil this  however whilst not all ideas make it to product development or design each is critically technically and commercially appraised before any financial commitment is made   to allow this creativity to flow there is a requirement that the organisation is committed to remaining independent product agnostic and not to be a reseller of third parties products software or services  equally this extends to not providing white label solutions for third parties to resell or to enter into any strategic alliances that could in any way appear to compromise the groups objectivity or independence   domain services   the strategic objective of the division is to create a universal environment a secure gated community through the trust top level domain that will provide a safer and more trustworthy internet for both businesses and consumers   applicants for a trust domain will have to verify their identity ensure their organisation is secure by complying to a strict and specific code of security policies and assure their infrastructure remains safe by undergoing regular compliance scanning   the policies have been developed by a coalition of industry and ncc group experts and adhering to them will help provide comprehensive protection from vulnerabilities that threaten to compromise integrity availability and privacy   the business model is based around high renewal rates good margins and the highest standard of customer service  the take on of new customers will be slow and cautious ensuring that each transition to trust has been successful before embarking on the next one   the long term strategy is that domain services and assurance will develop a symbiotic relationship as the opportunities to cross sell assurance services increases as the trust community grows   business performance measures   the group manages the business using the kpis shown in the table below  reporting is daily weekly and monthly and has different levels of granularity according to each managers responsibility  the provision of accurate and quick management information has

estimates specifically pretax cash flow projections longterm growth rates and a pretax market discount rate   cash flow projections are based on the groups current twoyear plan  the main assumptions underlying that plan relate to customer termination rates and gross margins which incorporate past experience  beyond the twoyear plan these projections are extrapolated using an estimated longterm growth rate of    depending on the cgu  the growth rates used have been determined as the lower of the nominal gdp rates for the country in which the cgu is based and the long term compound annual growth rate in ebitda estimated by management  a different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes to the macroeconomic environment   the discount rates used have been based on managements calculation of the weighted average cost of capital using the capital asset pricing model to calculate the cost of equity  a range of alpha factors were used to reflect the risk of the cash generating units   the discount rate has been revised for each cgu to reflect the latest market assumptions for the riskfree rate the equity risk premium and the net cost of debt  pretax market discount rates of      have been used in discounting the projected cash flows in respect of the escrow cgus and    for assurance testing cgus    the directors do not believe that a reasonably possible change of assumptions would cause the recoverable amounts to fall below book value for any of the cash generating units due to the significant levels of headroom and prudent
