company profile information business description history background information on computer sciences corporation reference for business company history index uncategorized computer sciences corporation  company profile information business description history background information on computer sciences corporation  east grand avenueel segundo california usa history of computer sciences corporation computer sciences corporation csc is one of the largest software developers and computer systems integrators in the united states the firm operates designs and installs computerbased information systems offers consulting services and processes medical insurance claims csc was formed in los angeles in  by fletcher jones and roy nutt with only  in capital jones entered the infant computer industry by chance he had taken a job as a mathematical analyst in the data processing section of chance vought aircraft company because it was the best job offer he received after graduating from college from there jones became director of the columbus division computer center for north american aviation his acquaintance roy nutt a top member of united aircraft corporations data processing staff shared joness opinion that large amounts of new software would soon prove a crucial need for the growing computer industry a number of computer manufacturers were coming out with new models and the two felt the manufacturers would never be able to write the necessary software in house computer sciences corporation stepped in to offer its software writing services to major computer manufacturers among them international business machines ibm one of the firms early jobs was to design a large software system for honeywell it later wrote a complete package of programs for univac from the start however jones felt that the biggest profits in software lay in creating proprietary software software to which they would hold exclusive rights that could be sold to a large number of users not in customwritten programs for specific customers more than a decade later firms like microsoft corporation lotus development corporation and computer associates proved the validity of joness assessment but csc has never managed to tap this market the firms first major proprietary software was computax a large complex set of programs used to calculate individual income taxes and prepare a tax return it was used chiefly by accountants doing corporate and personal tax returns computax proved popular and was turned into an independent company with csc holding a  percent interest by  with company profits at  million the yearold jones was worth  million and appeared in time magazine as part of a cover article on young millionaires government contracts have been the most important source of csc revenue and the firm started signing them early in its history in june of  for example csc signed a  million contract with nasa national aeronautics and space administration to support a computation laboratory in huntsville alabama annual sales reached  million by  and the firm became the first software company to go public software development had become the fastestgrowing segment of the flourishing computer industry and csc dominated the market the firm moved into new ventures introducing computicket which made it possible for consumers to buy computerized tickets to entertainment events through nonboxoffice vendors in  only about one percent of us computers were linked to each other so the plan was an ambitious and formidable task for a small young company to realize alone csc had been working with western union for four years to develop methods for transmitting computerized information over telegraph wires jones and russell w mcfall president of western union agreed in principle to merge their companies in  although it was only onesixth of the size of western union csc was to be the dominant partner the yearold western union was growing very slowly while the nineyearold csc was soaring the merger fell through but csc decided to continue with computicket anyway it also continued to grow reaching  million in profits on  million in sales in  william r hoover who had been with csc since  took over daily operations in  leaving jones free to concentrate on longterm strategy jones forged ahead with an even more challenging plandubbed the infonet systemto create a nationwide computer network offering customers computer power and software via communications lines jones planned  centers to be opened by mid csc was forced to expand its services by the beginning of the s because computer makers had added to their inhouse programming staffs and no longer required much work from outside companies as a result cscs profit growth fell and it searched for new markets particularly timesharing leasing computer time to companies that did not own their own units meanwhile csc continued to make its money developing software packages for customers and received  million in revenue in this area in  out of a total of  this included a broadened relationship with various us government agencies the firm also developed a computerized air cargo handling system for heathrow airport in london and did work for large corporations like general electric and travelers insurance csc was still the biggest computer software and services company in the united states but not all of its customers were happy the firm signed a contract with new york citys offtrack betting corporation in  to develop a system that would enable wagers on horse races to be placed by telephone and at branch offices csc took several months to get the system off the ground however allowing competitors like control data to get into the race by  csc operated  betting terminals only about half of offtrack bettings total and soon thereafter offtrack betting canceled cscs contract but the capitalintensive development of computicket and infonet posed far worse problems for csc without the resources of a company like western union to help it the costs of developing these networkbased services was devastating computicket ran into stiff competition from control datas ticketron and csc wrote off  million in computicket development costs in  and scrapped the project at that point the firms longterm debt was  million while its equity was only  million largely because of this cash crunch csc sold computax in  the firm took a  million writeoff on product development costs in  mostly for the expensive infonet venture by mid only six infonet centers were in operation and they were running at less than  percent of capacity csc was forced to pay a penalty to sperry rand because it had to cancel an order for  million worth of sperry computers takeover rumors circulated but the firm remained the leading independent software company in contract services with  percent of revenue coming from services rather than proprietary software which had not sold nearly as well as expected csc was overextended and facing another cash crisis in late  that same year jones died when his singleengine plane crashed into a california hillside hoover then  was named his successor though some analysts thought the firm might go bankrupt a welltimed government contract probably saved the company however the month contract to supply computer services to the general services administration was highly profitable bringing needed cash and an infusion of credibility to the beleaguered csc the contract was for remote computing services and csc used infonet to fulfill it although the contract was renewed in february  the firm remained only moderately profitable making  million on sales of  million in  the software market had grown from  million in  to about  billion in  but competition had increased dramatically and cscs market share had shrunk about half of the firms revenue was coming from the us government by the mids prompting industry analysts to warn that csc was overly dependent on government contracts critics pointed out that government contracts were usually shortterm and that bureaucrats faced constant pressure to diversify their sources of computer services the critics were proven at least partially right in  when the general services administration contract expired and was put up for bids making it a far less profitable deal csc lost  million after the  iranian revolution when its operations there ceased it also lost millions of dollars after it bought the troubled computer services businesses of itel incorporated csc was forced to spend an additional several million dollars in legal fees defending itself against justice department charges of fraud the margin of the firms data services division declined to about  percent by  from a high of  percent despite these difficulties csc remained the largest independent computer services company in volume with sales of  million in  the company did well if not spectacularly by selling timesharing infonet the primary component of this system accounted for  percent of sales in  but this niche disappeared quickly buried under the rapid spread of desktop computer networks that took over many of the functions of mainframe computers as a result hoover shifted cscs focus again this time towards systems integrationthe use of computers as the base for communications networksusually for government agencies like the navy or nasa csc was nasas fourthlargest customer and benefitted from the defense buildup that took place in the early s under president ronald reagan winning a  million contract in  for work at cape canaveral it also signed a  million contract to computerize the saudi arabian ministry of the interior csc soon got into hospital information systems as well after winning a large contract to take care of californias medicaid computer services in late  it landed a  million fiveyear contract for processing medicaid claims in tennessee though csc was doing well in this niche other firms including ross perots quickly growing electronic data systems were aggressively aiming for many of the same markets after a surge in business in the early s cscs growth remained flat until about  when revenue approached  billion then when government contracts began moving toward large fixedprice deals csc benefitted winning  percent of the large contracts that it bid on in early  it signed a  million agreement to develop a secure data network for the us customs service new contracts for  added up to  billion about as much as the previous three years combined growth in the commercial segment of the systems integration market standing at  percent a year was by far outstripping the federal segments  percent annual growth large corporations like eastman kodak kmart and exxon were using systems integrators to choose their hardware and develop their software but their contracts were generally much smaller than government deals making marketing and selling that much more important government contracts with their safe but lowmargin work still accounted for about  percent of revenues but csc was diversifying and aimed to increase commercial work significantlyto about  percent of total contractsby  to move toward that goal the firm began an acquisition spree hoping to quickly build its technical staff and marketing ability targeting companies in the health care and systems integration fields csc built upon areas in which it was already active one of the first acquisitions was computer partners incorporated in  csc paid  million for this small boston company which specialized in designing systems for corporations and had strength in the retail and distribution market two years later csc bought a consulting firm index group inc hoping to compete with large accounting firms that advised corporate management on what computer systems and software to buy hoover also spruced up csc management appointing six new managers to important positions and focusing on large contracts one of those contracts was a  million officeautomation deal it signed with the us air force a deal that included linking  telephones with computers by  csc had become the fifthlargest supplier of information technology to the federal government with sales for the year reaching  billion to better compete in the commercial arena the firm formed a new commercialsystems group in  to offer systems integration in the united states and europe despite this move most of cscs important contracts continued to be governmentrelated it negotiated a  million contract with nasa to provide software for the ames research center in  in  csc renewed a  million deal with nasa for engineering services at an experimental center at wallops island virginia won a fouryear contract worth up to  million with the us army communications and electronics command and signed a fiveyear dataprocessing and telecommunications services contract with the environmental protection agency worth an expected  million in  csc won a fiveyear contract worth up to  million from the defense information systems agency to maintain and operate systems supporting the command and control of us forces worldwide and the firm beat out xerox corp for a us army contract to develop a computer information system for weapons parts that contract was worth an estimated  million riding this wave of large contracts the firms sales reached  billion in  and  billion in  helped by a resurgence in corporate outsourcing in the early s csc did sign some large corporate contracts including a year deal with general dynamics valued at about  billion general dynamics contracted its entire information systems division to csc which acquired  general dynamics employees csc also paid  million for general dynamics nationwide data center infrastructure in  the firm signed another big corporate deal a  million year contract with wci steel inc to do data processing nonetheless revenues from the us government were  billion in  compared with revenues of  million from commercial sources operating income reached  million in  up from  million in  and csc used its cash to continue acquiring information companies the firm acquired saatchi  saatchis cleveland consulting associates for  million in  and spent over  million on acquisitions in  buying moria informatique a parisbased systems integrator and software firm for  million butler cox plc an information technology consulting firm for  million and intelicom solutions corp a software development
