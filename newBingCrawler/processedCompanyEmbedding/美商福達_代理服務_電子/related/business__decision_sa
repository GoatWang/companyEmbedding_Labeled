mission statement the business vision andcompany mission statement while a business must continually adapt to its competitive environment there are certain core ideals that remain relatively steady and provide guidance in the process of strategic decisionmaking these unchanging ideals form the business vision and are expressed in the company mission statement in their 6 article entitled building your companys vision james collins and jerry porras provided a framework for understanding business vision and articulating it in a mission statement the mission statement communicates the firms core ideology and visionary goals generally consisting of the following three components core values to which the firm is committed core purpose of the firm visionary goals the firm will pursue to fulfill its mission the firms core values and purpose constitute its core ideology and remain relatively constant they are independent of industry structure and the product life cycle the core ideology is not created in a mission statement rather the mission statement is simply an expression of what already exists the specific phrasing of the ideology may change with the times but the underlying ideology remains constant the three components of the business vision can be portrayed as follows core values    corepurpose       businessvision          visionarygoals   core values the core values are a few values no more than five or so that are central to the firm core values reflect the deeply held values of the organization and are independent of the current industry environment and management fads one way to determine whether a value is a core value to ask whether it would continue to be supported if circumstances changed and caused it to be seen as a liability if the answer is that it would be kept then it is core value another way to determine which values are core is to imagine the firm moving into a totally different industry the values that would be carried with it into the new industry are the core values of the firm core values will not change even if the industry in which the company operates changes if the industry changes such that the core values are not appreciated then the firm should seek new markets where its core values are viewed as an asset for example if innovation is a core value but then 0 years down the road innovation is no longer valued by the current customers rather than change its values the firm should seek new markets where innovation is advantageous the following are a few examples of values that some firms has chosen to be in their core excellent customer service pioneering technology creativity integrity social responsibility core purpose the core purpose is the reason that the firm exists this core purpose is expressed in a carefully formulated mission statement like the core values the core purpose is relatively unchanging and for many firms endures for decades or even centuries this purpose sets the firm apart from other firms in its industry and sets the direction in which the firm will proceed the core purpose is an idealistic reason for being while firms exist to earn a profit the profit motive should not be highlighted in the mission statement since it provides little direction to the firms employees what is more important is how the firm will earn its profit since the how is what defines the firm initial attempts at stating a core purpose often result in too specific of a statement that focuses on a product or service to isolate the core purpose it is useful to ask why in response to firstpass productoriented mission statements for example if a market research firm initially states that its purpose is to provide market research data to its customers asking why leads to the fact that the data is to help customers better understand their markets continuing to ask why may lead to the revelation that the firms core purpose is to assist its clients in reaching their objectives by helping them to better understand their markets the core purpose and values of the firm are not selected  they are discovered the stated ideology should not be a goal or aspiration but rather it should portray the firm as it really is any attempt to state a value that is not already held by the firms employees is likely to not be taken seriously visionary goals the visionary goals are the lofty objectives that the firms management decides to pursue this vision describes some milestone that the firm will reach in the future and may require a decade or more to achieve in contrast to the core ideology that the firm discovers visionary goals are selected these visionary goals are longer term and more challenging than strategic or tactical goals there may be only a 0 chance of realizing the vision but the firm must believe that it can do so collins and porras describe these lofty objectives as big hairy audacious goals these goals should be challenging enough so that people nearly gasp when they learn of them and realize the effort that will be required to reach them most visionary goals fall into one of the following categories target  quantitative or qualitative goals such as a sales target or fords goal to democratize the automobile common enemy  centered on overtaking a specific firm such as the 0s goal of philipmorris to displace rjr role model  to become like another firm in a different industry or market for example a cycling accessories firm might strive to become the nike of the cycling industry internal transformation  especially appropriate for very large corporations for example ge set the goal of becoming number one or number two in every market it serves while visionary goals may require significant stretching to achieve many visionary companies have succeeded in reaching them once such a goal is reached it needs to be replaced otherwise it is unlikely that the organization will continue to be successful for example ford succeeded in placing the automobile within the reach of everyday people but did not replace this goal with a better one and general motors overtook ford in the 0s recommended reading jeffrey abrahams the mission statement

making yet business executives seem impervious to its lessons the problem is not that they lack the desire to make better decisions it’s that the bulk of the research does not apply to the kind of decision that’s most challenging for them decisions vary along two dimensions the first considers whether the decision maker can influence the terms and the outcome the second addresses whether the aim is to do well or to do better than others before making any decision the most important thing is to understand what kind it is decision research has produced good advice for routine choices and judgments such as personal investment decisions where people are choosing among the products before them have no ability to change them and are not competing with anyone for these decisions research has shown it’s important to avoid common biases but strategic decisions such as entering a new market or acquiring another company are completely different executives can actively influence outcomes furthermore success means doing better than rivals for these decisions executives need more than an ability to avoid common biases they require a talent for cleareyed analysis and the ability to take bold action photography stephen petegorsky artwork matt phillips prop 0 oil on canvas 0″ x ″ the past decade has seen a wealth of research on decision making much of it not only useful but also fascinating to read at the same time a growing chorus has noted that business executives in particular are largely impervious to its lessons they seem unable to apply those lessons or perhaps uninterested in doing so advances in our understanding of decision making have not been matched by improvements in practice having thought about this puzzle for some time i suggest that there is a good explanation for the disconnect it’s not that executives lack the desire to make better decisions or that they’re in denial about their propensity for error the problem lies elsewhere it’s that the bulk of the decisionmaking research published to date applies to one type of decision and it’s not the type that’s most challenging for managers their most important and most difficult decisions—strategic decisions with consequences for the performance of the company—call for a very different approach the fact is that people need to make up their minds in a great variety of circumstances and it’s a source of confusion that the same word “decision” is used for all of them when a grocery store customer encounters an entire aisle of breakfast cereals we say he has a decision to make when a high school senior considers which college to attend we say she is facing a decision when a poker player weighs whether to raise or fold that’s a decision too and when a company faces an opportunity—to enter a new market acquire another company or launch a new product—what is required of its management a decision the same term is applied to routine as well as complex deliberations to both smallstakes bets and highstakes commitments and to exploratory steps as well as irreversible moves it stands to reason that insights about decisions in one kind of circumstance might not shed much light on decisions in another even worse they may lead a decision maker astray in this article i’ll argue that before we can advise people on how to make better strategic decisions we need to equip them to recognize how decisions differ for that we need to break the universe of decisions into a few categories we can then suggest the best approach for each let me propose a way categorizing decisions decisions vary along two dimensions control and performance the first considers how much we can influence the terms of the decision and the outcome are we choosing among options presented to us or can we shape those options are we making a onetime judgment unable to change what happens after the fact or do we have some control over how things play out once we’ve made the decision the second dimension addresses the way we measure success is our aim to do well no matter what anyone else does or do we need to do better than others that is is performance absolute or relative there are other ways to think about decisions of course some are made by people acting as individuals and others by people acting as leaders of organizations some are oneoffs while others are part of a sequence with the results of one letting us improve the next but as a basic way to understand how decisions differ control and performance are the two dimensions that matter most combining them creates four fields of decisions see the exhibit “four types of decisions” four types of decisions to get better at making decisions it’s important to recognize the different types those in the first field of the matrix—where we have no control over outcomes and our performance is absolute we aren’t competing with anyone—include consumer choices and personal investment decisions those in the fourth field—where we can influence outcomes and need to outperform rivals—include the strategic decisions that are most challenging for managers such as launching a new product or entering a new market find this and other hbr graphics in our visual library  making routine choices and judgments when you go shopping in a supermarket or a department store you typically pick from the products before you those items perhaps a jug of milk or a jar of jam are what they are you have no ability to improve them control is low moreover you make the choice that suits you best—it doesn’t matter what anyone else is buying performance is absolute the same goes for most personal investment decisions you may be able to decide which company’s shares to buy but you can’t improve their performance after you buy them you want high returns but aren’t trying to do better than others the goal is to do well not to finish first in a competition in recent years trailblazing research by cognitive psychologists and behavioral economists has demonstrated that people make decisions in ways that do not conform to the tenets of economic rationality they exhibit systematic biases those findings have shed light on many firstfield decisions in particular for example we now understand that the way options are framed and presented can shape our purchasing decisions we know that investors often misunderstand the nature of random events imagining that several gains indicate that a correction is due or that a string of losses means gains must follow—an error known as the gambler’s fallacy they also fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy throwing good money after bad in an effort to recoup what they’ve lost for many firstfield decisions research has taught us to be aware of and try to minimize these common biases  influencing outcomes many decisions involve more than selecting among options we cannot improve or making judgments about things we cannot influence in so much of life we use our energy and talents to make things happen imagine that the task at hand is to determine how long we will need to complete a project that’s a judgment we can control indeed it’s up to us to get the project done here positive thinking matters by believing we can do well perhaps even holding a level of confidence that is by some definitions a bit excessive we can often improve performance optimism isn’t useful in picking stocks whose performance we cannot change but in the second field where we have the ability to influence outcomes it can be very important some activities call for us to move between the first and second fields shifting our mindset back and forth the approach known as “deliberate practice” which can lead to expert performance see “the making of an expert” by k anders ericsson michael j prietula and edward t cokely hbr july–august 007 is based on objective and deliberate thinking before an event full commitment with a positive attitude while taking action and then a return to dispassionate analysis after the event—what is known as an afteraction review the ability to shift effectively between mindsets is a crucial element of high performance in many repeated tasks of short duration from sports to sales for many routine choices and judgments research has taught us to be aware of and try to minimize common biases  placing competitive bets the third field introduces a competitive dimension success is no longer a matter of absolute performance but depends on how well you do relative to others the best decisions must anticipate the moves of rivals that’s the essence of strategic thinking which princeton professor avinash dixit and yale professor barry nalebuff define as “the art of outdoing an adversary knowing that the adversary is trying to do the same to you” investments in stocks are typically firstfield decisions but if you’re taking part in a contest where the investor with the highest return takes the prize you’re in the third field now you need to make decisions with an eye to what your rivals will do anticipating their likely moves so that you can have the best chance of winning in the third field guidance comes from the branch of economics that studies competitive dynamics game theory wellknown illustrations of game theory include the prisoner’s dilemma and the game rockpaperscissors in which the winner is determined by the interaction of all players’ decisions game theory can illuminate areas from price competition to geopolitics yet it has an important limitation players cannot alter the terms of the game the possible moves are specified and gains and costs cannot be changed that’s a helpful simplification for purposes of modeling but it reduces the value for managers management after all is precisely about influencing outcomes over time that’s why herbert simon in his 7 nobel prize address commented that for all its sophistication game theory does not provide “satisfactory descriptions of actual human behavior” an essential aspect of so many crucial decisions is absent decisions in the fourth field the crux of our discussion comes into focus when we consider the fourth field for these decisions we can actively influence outcomes and success means doing better than rivals here we find the essence of strategic management when positive thinking can influence outcomes only those who go beyond what seems reasonable will succeed business executives aren’t like shoppers picking a product or investors choosing a stock simply making a choice that leads to one outcome or another by the way they lead and communicate and through their ability to inspire and encourage executives can influence outcomes that’s the definition of “management” moreover they are in charge of organizations that compete vigorously with others doing better than rivals is vital that’s where strategy comes in the decisions to enter a new market release a new product or acquire another firm are all in the fourth field but we can find many examples beyond business in sports a coach shapes the performance of athletes melding them into an effective team that can outperform the opponent or think of politics for a voter casting a ballot is essentially a firstfield decision you vote for the candidate you prefer for the candidate however the reality is very different election day is the last hurdle in a long process in which performance is relative—only one person can win—and outcomes can and must be shaped candidates need to inspire donors build an organization attract and motivate campaign workers and ultimately persuade voters a winning political campaign depends on a smart assessment of rivals as well as the ability to mobilize supporters often in the face of long odds the fourth field includes some of the most consequential decisions of all but because of their complexity they don’t lend themselves to the careful controls of laboratory experiments so we know less about how best to make them see the sidebar “firstfield research fourthfield decisions” what sort of mindset do they require when we can influence outcomes it is useful to summon high levels of selfbelief and when we need to outperform rivals such elevated levels are not just useful but indeed essential only those who are able to muster a degree of commitment and determination that is by some definitions excessive will be in a position to win that’s not to say that wildly optimistic thinking will predictably lead to success it won’t but in tough competitive situations where positive thinking can influence outcomes only those who are willing to go beyond what seems reasonable will succeed firstfield research fourthfield decisions in many of the most consequential decisions executives face—whether to acquire a company say or launch a new product—they can influence the outcomes and their choices are successful only if they’re better than the competition’s these decisions fall into the fourth field of a matrix that categorizes decisions along two dimensions our control over the outcome and whether the outcome depends on other people’s decisions we would benefit greatly from improving how we make these fourthfield decisions yet most recent research has examined judgment and choice in firstfield decisions which offer no control over outcomes and can be successful regardless of what anyone else does this focus stems in part from the power of carefully controlled experiments which are an ideal way to isolate the cognitive mechanisms of human thought by asking subjects to make choices among clearly stated options or to make judgments about things they cannot influence we derive responses that can be neatly compared free of extraneous factors decision research has made profound contributions because of the rigor of its experimental methods the unintentional effect however is that less research has focused on the second and third fields and much less on the fourth field where the ability to influence outcomes makes the comparison of responses across people problematic and where the need to outperform rivals adds further complexity thus the paradox fourthfield decisions which in real life include many of the most important have received the least attention decision experiments have certainly improved our understanding of the human mind with many practical applications the danger lies in taking the findings that are appropriate for one kind of decision and applying them to other kinds we should not be surprised if business executives seem not to embrace this advice strategic decisions are fundamentally different from the routine choices and judgments so elegantly captured in laboratory settings to do justice to the decisions executives face researchers should employ a wider range of methods in recent years a great deal of attention has focused on teaching executives to be aware of common biases and to avoid their ill effects see “before you make that big decision…” by daniel kahneman dan lovallo and olivier sibony hbr june 0 of course it’s good to appreciate the lessons of cognitive psychology and to understand the propensity for common errors but if we apply those lessons to the world of strategic management we’re missing a trick when facing decisions in the fourth field executives need on the one hand a talent for careful and dispassionate analysis which we call leftbrain thinking and on the other hand a willingness to push boundaries which we call the right stuff discernment and versatility in the course of their daily responsibilities executives face a range of decisions often in each of the four fields outlined here before making any decision the most important thing is to understand which field it is in for routine judgments and choices where we cannot influence outcomes and need not consider the competition wellknown lessons about avoiding common biases make good sense for other decisions a different set of skills is needed in his profile of st louis cardinals manager tony la russa buzz bissinger wrote that baseball managers require “the combination of skills essential to the trade part tactician part psychologist part riverboat gambler” that’s a good description of many kinds of decision makers in business as well as in sports the tactician plays a competitive game—sensing the actions of rivals anticipating the way a given move may lead to a countermove and planning the best response the psychologist must shape outcomes by inspiring others by setting goals and providing encouragement and by offering clear and direct feedback the riverboat gambler knows that outcomes aren’t just a matter of cold numbers and probabilities it’s also important to read an opponent in order to know when to raise the stakes when to bluff and when to fold decision makers need to develop two vital skills first they must be able to discern the nature of the decision at hand second they need to respond with the appropriate approach able to act now as a psychologist then as a tactician next as a riverboat gambler and perhaps once again as a psychologist when it comes to the most complex decisions of all those that drive the fortunes of organizations executives need more than an ability to avoid common errors they require a seemingly contradictory blend a talent for cleareyed analysis and the ability to take bold action a version of this article appeared in the november 0 issue of harvard business review phil rosenzweig is a professor of strategy and international business since 00 he has served as director of
