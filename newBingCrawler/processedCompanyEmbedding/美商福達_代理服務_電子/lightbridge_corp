the requests according to lightbridge the company expects to submit an application to the nrc in  for use of lightbridge fuel lead test assemblies in an operating us pressurized water reactor as early as  lightbridge is developing the first truly next generation commercial fuel design that can provide significant fuel performance and economic benefits to nuclear utilities president and ceo seth

to lightbridge  first quarter earnings and business update call operator instructionsat this time it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to david waldman investor relations sir the floor is yoursdavid waldman thank you julie and good morning and welcome to lightbridges first quarter  business update conference call the companys first quarter business update press release was distributed after the market closed yesterday and can be viewed on the investor relations page of the lightbridge website at wwwltbridgecom if anyone has questions after the call you may contact crescendo communications the investor relations firm for the company at   seth grae our chief executive officer will lead todays call in addition the following executives are available to answer your questions linda zwobota chief financial officer jim malone chief nuclear fuel development officer andrey mushakov lightbridges executive vice president for international nuclear operations jon johnson senior vice president and nuclear regulatory expert and jonathan baguette vice president and deputy nuclear quality assurance managertodays presentation includes forwardlooking statements about the companys competitive position and product and service offerings during the course of todays call words such as expect anticipate believe and intend will be used in our discussion of goals or events in the future this presentation is based on our current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from such estimates these and other risks are set forth in more detail in lightbridges filings with the securities and change commission lightbridge does not assume any obligation to update or revise any such forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new developments or otherwise you can participate in todays call in  ways first you may submit questions for management in writing to irltbridgecom if youve already submitted a question we thank you you can submit them at any time during the prepared remarks or during the qa period second after the prepared remarks telephone lines will be opened for live questionsnow here is lightbridges ceo seth grae please go ahead sirseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director thank you david and good morning everybody this quarter we continued to make progress toward commercial development of our proprietary nextgeneration nuclear fuel its only been a bit over a month since our last conference call well keep the opening remarks brief to get your questions we appreciate the continued support from areva in moving the process forward toward establishment of a formal joint venture between our  companies areva is an ideal partner with extensive industry knowledge and expertise in nuclear fuel assembly design licensing and fabrication areva also brings an established global customer base including many of the leading nuclear operators in the united states europe and asiaread morethe term sheet signed with areva covers fuel assemblies for most types of light water reactors including pressurized water reactors boiling water reactors small modular reactors and research reactors we expect to formalize the joint venture with areva to develop manufacture and commercialize fuel assemblies based on our fuel technology in the coming months although it may seem from the outside that this process is moving slowly we have actually made tremendous progress and have expanded beyond the initial scope of the project in fact we believe the current scenario will be more profitable for lightbridge than the straight licensing arrangement we had originally envisionedwere also moving forward in finalizing plans for irradiation testing of our nuclear fuel samples at the halden reactor in norway at the same time we are working closely with a leading us nuclear utility to establish an end user agreement for the first use of lightbridgedesigned nuclear fuel in a commercial reactor in the united states this utility is an addition to the one with which we signed a letter of intent in november of last year to date we have received numerous patents covering our metallic nuclear fuel rod design and we have very broad intellectual property protection in all key markets including the united states canada china japan south korea russia european union member countries and elsewhere around the world securing our intellectual property rights is an important step in advancing our global strategyour nuclear technology has gained significant attention within the industry we presented the lightbridge fuel at a number of important industry events including our recent presentation at idaho national laboratorys gain fuel safety research workshopill now turn the call over to linda zwobota who is lightbridges chief financial officer to summarize the companys financial results for the quarter lindalinda joan zwobota lightbridge corporation  cfo and treasurer thanks seth as of march   we had approximately  million in cash and restricted cash compared to approximately  million in cash and restricted cash as of december   the  million increase in cash and equivalents resulted from the sale of approximately  million of our common stock during the quarter ended march   offset by net cash used in operating activities of approximately  millionwe had approximately  million in working capital as of march   as compared to working capital of approximately  million as of december   stockholders equity as of march   was approximately  million compared to stockholders equity of approximately  million as of december   we have no debt or debt credit lines and we have financed our operations to date through the sale of our common stock and our consulting revenuefor the first quarter ended march   our net loss attributable to common shareholders was approximately  million or a loss of  per share on revenue of  million in the same quarter of  the net loss available to common shareholders was  million or loss per share of  per share on revenue of  millionthe net loss available to common shareholders for the  months ended march   of  million included warrant revaluation income of approximately  million which is a noncash item all warrants are now classified as equity on our balance sheet all revenue was generated from consulting services our main business is developing our nuclear fuel and we may continue to provide some consulting services in the future but we have shifted the focus and resources of the company to the fuel division and away from consultingstockbased compensation expense for the quarters ended march   and  was approximately  million this concludes my summary i will be available for your questions during the next segment of todays presentation seth back to youseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director thank you linda lets open the call to your questions in addition to asking live questions by telephone you can also submit questions in writing to irltbridgecom we will pause while the operator jen reviews the procedure for asking live questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructionsdavid waldman while were polling for questions let me start with some questions that were submitted in advance or during the call our first question is lightbridge concerned with the timeline of negotiations with areva and can you explain why the deal is taking as long as it has to finalizeseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director well what i think first of all is that the deal has been changing in some ways from the initial concept that we think are better for lightbridge and lightbridges investors than a straight licensing deal to have a  jv with areva what were trying to do is more expansive well also fold again now direct work with  utilities leading toward end user agreements were not just trying to have qualifying fuel in a reactor in norway were actually bringing toward contracting fuel in commercial reactors in the united states what were putting together is a contractual package to bring our fuel to the global market now there is a lot of steps within that and we and areva and utilities need to be confident in the nrc licensing and the data that will be generated jonathan baguette is here with us and on this call who is the deputy quality assurance manager who also makes sure that all of the data generated everywhere will be usable for licensing were dealing with the largest nuclear supplier company in the world with areva we have a tremendous commitment from their company in level of what theyre doing with us both here at the united states and at headquarters in france in paris as well as their fuel division headquarters in lyon france and with that ill just ask jim malone who has been leading the work with areva to commentjames p malone lightbridge corporation  chief nuclear fuel development officer seth i agree that the mission if you will has changed substantially in our favor because of the approach of using a joint venture company to approach the market versus simply licensing the product to areva as a fuel fabricator we now have them as a partner and their skills and our intellectual property match very well together if it is indicated to take a little bit more time than we would like that is because of the change in the relationship which is going to benefit the shareholders in the long runseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director all right can i also  while we talk about our announcements coming within month i think its probably fair to say we expect the next major announcement to come within about  month so i mean this is not something that i think youll have to wait all that much longer for some major developmentsdavid waldman great thank you our next question and then well open it up for some live calls  the latest proxy includes request to authorize the sale of shares in excess of  what was the rationale for this authorization and is the company planning to raise capitalseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director well no no immediate plans first of all we are required to obtain shareholder approval prior to any issuance of our common stock equal to  or above  of the shares outstanding however this does not mean that we actually will raise any capital were interested in financing flexibility in fact we have no immediate plans to raise capital the rationale for this request in trying to maximize financial flexibility is that we want to do this in advance of what we believe will be the most major milestones in the history of this company and potential very significant strategic transactions with major entities in our industry this year and we want to utilize this authorization if and only if following one or more significant events we believe that there are terms that we could use to bring value to the investors in the company and we want to have the ability to pounce and not wait months for an authorization after that point so thats why were doing itdavid waldman thank you well now take a moment and open up the lines operatoroperator thank you our first live question comes from james anderson a private investorunidentified participant on the lightbridge website you document preliminary agreements with various parties since inception anticipating fabrication and commercializing your fuel forwardlooking statements over the years have foretolled of fabrication demonstration and commercialization planned to occurred by dates that have already passed the proposed jv with areva is a promising one but investors have already waited a long time for similar agreements to move beyond letters of interest memorandums of understanding and term sheets in the coming months into something binding and rewarding these vague and often repeated phrases make us wonder if the finish line is perpetually out of reach therefore can you provide more specific dates regarding norway areva and the us utility and one other related question is theres also some legislation hr  and other things coming through the pipeline do you anticipate those would help you accelerate your timelinesseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director thank you for the question james first of all ill say that one of the things weve dealt with is a remarkably changing nuclear power industry and there are a lot of companies in this industry that arent here anymore or there are about not to be here anymore or if they survive including some of the biggest ones in the industry in this country and some other places will be in very reduced and different forms and i think  of the biggest causes of changes in the industry that ive talked about on previous calls are the collapse of natural gas prices which has just put tremendous pressure on nuclear power making the economics of reactors just crucial to the existence of individual reactors to utilities and to the industry in some countries and the second is fukushima making safety and the focus on safety the issue and what a lot of other companies that are no longer here focused on were other points  other than economics of the existing fleet and safety and we had technology that focused in other areas on reducing amounts of waste on longterm toxicity of waste we still bring those benefits but we changed and we invented a metallic fuel that provides what the industry now and as we see it going forward will need and we did fabrication testing in the past that leads to what we have today we did fabrication in russia we did testing we finished that sort of just in time before political relations fell apart to the point where we probably couldnt do that today and it all helped get us to where we are today so had we sort of felt we were in a straitjacket to meet a thoriumbased fuel time frame or other things we were looking at we might have congratulated ourselves on meeting a time frame for a product the industry doesnt want to use and instead we inhouse were able to invent this technology working very closely with utilities telling us exactly what they need for the future and those utilities are duke exelon dominion and southern company and with the pull of interest of those utilities in this product we attracted multiple fuel fabricators and we chose areva as one we wanted to go with first and fortunately have been able to bring that very much along and even within this process there have been delays we thought by the end of last year we would have the joint venture with areva and here we are in may of this year and havent finalized yet but as we said before the work has actually been ongoing there is a lot happening under the agreements weve already signed and we are very close to making some major announcements that relate directly to this fuel to bring unique economic and safety advantages to this industry that we think nobody else can or will be able to do as for hr  and other legislation here in the washington dc area were very close to keeping tabs on these issues including through the nuclear energy institute of which lightbridge is a member and is a very active one nuclear energy institute is very actively involved we follow what they do we sometimes attend meetings on capitol hill what i would say is that i dont think hr  would accelerate our time frames what i will say is that i think it makes  and other legislation being proposed  i think it makes it more interesting for areva and for the utilities on funding that they might be able to ascertain for their work in the project going forward from the government and perhaps we with our joint venture with areva could obtain ill also say that were very confident in our time frame now more than ever because of buyin from areva from utilities that were working on and not just in the near term dates but the longterm dates of actually bringing the fuel to market and everything needed to bring commercial fuel to the market so i know thats a little bit of a meandering response but i think were in the best place weve ever been right now and are very close to some major announcementsdavid waldman thank you our next  were going to read another question that was submitted in advance will the fuel be tested for a worstcase scenario in the near term do you need to complete this testing prior to a commercial contract and would this testing prove the ability of the fuel design to preclude an explosion scenario in such an eventseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director well i mean what i say first of all is particularly since fukushima regulatory agencies like the nrc here in the us and others around the world have been looking at what they call beyonddesignbasis testing or severe accident testing  the kind you referenced in the question and we are planning to do this type of testing and analysis and ill ask jim then jon to comment jim again is leading this particular work and jon who ran these areas in many respects for the us nuclear regulatory commission before he was with lightbridge but jim why dont you startjames p malone lightbridge corporation  chief nuclear fuel development officer with respect to the fuel at  being tested in severe conditions or what i prefer to call the torture test for the fuel we will be testing the fuel for its ability to withstand severe accidents there is a facility in idaho at the idaho national laboratory that i was at earlier just last week called a treat facility and thats for transient examination of fuel and it actually takes fuel and the reactor system at treat is capable of basically melting the fuel no matter what kind it is and determining what happens and the real key is how long it takes for fuel to get into trouble  to lose what we call coolable geometry and we believe our fuel is among the best and there is some industry concurrence to that fact building at the moment due to the fact that some of the competing fuels have not shown their ability to extend coolable geometry for a very long period of time so the torture test that i mentioned is also tied back to the reference to the fuel explosion at fukushima i need to clarify that for you the event at fukushima was a zirconiumsteam reaction where the cladding on that fuel reacted with the steam to release hydrogen  the ho in the steam  the hydrogen was released and the hydrogen is what was detonated by a spark in the system so its a  we dont want to say its a fuel explosion its rather a hydrogen event  rapid burn of hydrogen resulting in the explosions that were related to fukushima not the fuel but we will be testing for that alsoseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director and jon was the deputy director of reactor regulation at the nrc every nuclear regulator in the country reported to john so jonjon johnson lightbridge corporation  svp of nuclear regulatory expert yes one of the processes the nrc will use for using test  tests of the new fuel is really a phased testing there is a provision in the  each utilitys tech specs for allowing lead test assemblies to be inserted in nonlimiting locations in the core and so our test program will be a comprehensive test program that will go over a number of years but the initial parameters of this fuel are fairly well known were using uranium and zirconium and these materials are well known to the nrc as well as the industry and areva certainly our composition is a little different but we are sure that the reactivity addition accidents the loss of coolant accidents  we have some information that gives us confidence that the nrc will approve the insertion of individual rods or lead test assemblies and then while were doing the testing in halden we will also be getting some information from the testing in the operating reactor and the combination of all these tests will give confidence that the fuel design will meet all the nrc requirementsseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director thank you jon thanks jimdavid waldman thank you a related question if the fuel runs much cooler will that result in lower fuel burn up and thus more resulted waste productseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director jimjames p malone lightbridge corporation  chief nuclear fuel development officer the short answer is no to that question the fuel does run cooler it runs cooler because its got so much more heat transfer area so the if you will the heat flux excuse the technical term but it looks very similar to the existing fuel and  but its reduced per unit of area so we have an advantage there that allows the fuel to run cooler while still delivering the same amount of energy or greater coolant in the reactor which is the source of the steam so its a pretty straightforward process i dont think there is anything more to say about itdavid waldman great thank you our next question there are other competing advanced fuels such as the does accident tolerant fuels research and development project conducted by the advanced fuels campaign that seeks to develop nuclear fuels that can resist the generation of hydrogen and fuel melting that characterized the fukushima accident why is lightbridge not participating in this program did lightbridge attempt to participate and is lightbridge monitoring the technologies proposed by this program what advantages do lightbridges fuel have relative to these fuel conceptsseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director well ill first say that were working increasingly closely with the department of energy and weve been at doe headquarters recently jim was just last week at idaho national laboratories at the gain conference dealing specifically with these issues i will say that again that we believe that our fuel is the most superior technology for bringing new safety benefits to reactors and probably the only one that could bring these types of benefits and certainly the only one that could bring these types of benefits not only without an economic penalty but in fact with a significant economic advantage to the utilities jim do you want describe last week at idahojames p malone lightbridge corporation  chief nuclear fuel development officer yes last week at idaho the gain project that doe sponsored a fuel safety workshop and lightbridge was invited to participate in that workshop along with the existing advanced technology or accident tolerant fuels over the last several months weve seen a change in the approach first addressing the question as to whether or not we participate in the accident tolerant fuels program the answer is no we do not we considered it early on and were not looked upon favorably by the advisers to doe at the utilities because theres zirconium in the fuel and they are overreacting to the fact that we have zirconium and zirconium was part of the problem at fukushima however the community recently has invited lightbridge to participate along with the nuclear energy institute and the electric power research institute in all of the events and meetings related to accidenttolerant fuel i spoke at the meeting in idaho and referred to the lightbridge fuel as what was an ugly duckling is now suddenly turning into a swan in the eyes of the community we are included now in all of the meetings and have actually been asked by inaudible and nei jointly what can they do to help us move the fuel forward so i think thats significant and its a big change from where we weredavid waldman great thank you at this point ill turn the call back operator if you can reprompt again the instructions then well return to any remaining questions submitted electronicallyoperator operator instructionsdavid waldman so in the meantime our next question is can our fuel rods be used in the china national nuclear corporations thirdgeneration acp reactor this is their first small reactor to be built for commercial purposesseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director yes our fuel could be used in all watercooled reactors which includes all light water reactors which includes all pressurized water reactors the acp is a pressurized water reactor design a small pwr so our fuel could be used in that reactordavid waldman great thank you that concludes our questions i will turn the call back over to you sethseth grae lightbridge corporation  ceo president and executive director thank you very much david i just want to mention one last point at lightbridge weve been very privileged to be involved with the united arab emirates nuclear power program and a couple of days ago construction was completed on the first of the  reactors being built there barakah  construction was completed and we think thats a very significant milestone for the uae and we congratulate our friends and colleagues in the uae and i want to thank everybody for joining the call id like to thank all our investors we look forward to providing future updates we expect youll be hearing from us in the coming weeks and in the meantime our lines are always open at irltbridgecom and a telephone    thank you everybody and goodbyeoperator thank

content with causing geopolitical chaos the russians are wreaking havoc in the energy sector too in a positive way that is on monday i noted how russian scientists have created floating nuclear power plants which offer a radical solution to expanding nuclear power as an energy source well the russians aren’t the only ones innovating in this area one company much closer to home has taken a giant step further… it’s actually trying to reinvent the way nuclear fuel is produced to do so it’s going right to the source of nuclear energy the technology even boosts power output and is safer than conventional uraniumbased nuclear fuel there’s no question that it represents a major advancement in nuclear science but the question is how does its stock match up this company wants a nuclear revolution based on the outskirts of washington dc in mclean va lightbridge corp ltbr is a littleknown nuclear fuel technology firm its business is essentially divided between its technology rd and nuclear energy consultancy services lightbridge wants to shift the focus of nuclear fuel from conventional uranium to an element called thorium it’s a sound idea as you’ll see thorium boasts several benefits over uranium but there’s often a huge gap between innovation and execution and as you’ll also see getting this innovation off the ground and widely accepted as a nuclear fuel is a monumental challenge cash take a glance inside lightbridge’s books and things quickly turn dark and that’s putting it mildly the firm sports some of the worst numbers i’ve seen in a long time for example revenue and gross profit have steadily declined for over five years now in fact lightbridge’s revenue has plummeted by  since  dropping from  million to only  million last year gross profit same story it nosedived by  – from  million in  to a woeful  in  other major metrics are similarly awful lightbridge ceo seth grae claims the company is in a “developmental stage” that’s partly true… while the name “lightbridge” has only been around since  the company isn’t a startup the company was actually founded in  and was previously known as thorium power inc – and novastar resources ltd before that not only does this company appear to have an identity crisis it seems to have been in a “developmental stage” since  that’s  years with a steady drop in financial performance chaos meter  high impact as the global population rises so does the strain on the energy infrastructure and existing resources when it comes to the nuclear industry the world needs safer and more economically competitive nuclear power well lightbridge has invented and patented highimpact fuel technology that it believes will achieve both goals how by offering customers allmetal and thoriumbased fuels to replace today’s uraniumenriched power you see after uranium is mined it gets converted to a gaseous form it’s then transferred to an enrichment plant where it’s “enhanced” that enriched gaseous uranium is then transported to a fuel fabrication plant where it’s converted into uranium dioxide powder the powder is pressed into small fuel pellets that are then inserted into fuel rods when bundled together these rods form fuel assemblies that’s what powers nuclear reactors but lightbridge’s fuel rod technology offers new reactors and two alternative fuel types first there’s thorium thorium is a radioactive metal traces of it can be found in most rocks and soils and it’s about three times more plentiful than uranium that helps ease concerns over the uranium constraints lightbridge claims its array of thoriumbased rods are better than conventional uranium ones because they reduce the weight and volume of used fuel by  and uranium requirements by  allinall lightbridge says its thoriumbased fuel will increase nuclear reactor power output by  and eliminate nuclear waste material that’s used for nuclear weapon development lightbridge also offers an interchangeable allmetal fuel rod these entirely metallic fuel rods boast three key benefits… they provide a power output boost of up to  they result in a  rise in reactor uprate time spent running the required operating temperature of the fuel created from its allmetallic rods is  degrees fahrenheit compare that to the moltenhot  degrees fahrenheit required for oxide fuel this lower operating temperature keeps the fuel from approaching dangerous temperatures during accidents chaos meter  acceleration when it comes to shortterm stock accelerants there’s a common theme with lightbridge… given the company’s million market cap and thin volume any whiff of good news or bad news in the nuclear industry has the potential to move the stock big time… exclusive content trump’s plan to “make retirement great again” the “fake news” media won’t admit it… but thanks to trump… seniors across america now have a chance to turn a small stake of  into a small fortune there’s an estimated  trillion at stake click here to see how you can claim your share take a look… in addition lightbridge announced two weeks ago that it will be the first us company to work with the vietnam agency for radiation and nuclear safety varans to help develop the country’s nuclear energy program this is a lucrative opportunity vietnam’s billion nuclear industry is second only to china’s in southeast asia and the us commerce department says the market will grow to  billion by  as governments focus more on nuclear safety and finding innovative ways to generate power while avoiding disasters lightbridge is wellplaced to offer traders quick opportunities to profit be warned though this is a dangerous game to play given the stock’s low volume you’d be hardpressed to get out unscathed if shares fall hard chaos meter  orders the demand for nuclear power solutions today is stronger than ever given that lightbridge’s fuel offers both new and existing nuclear power plants better safety and power output the company believes it can generate revenue from new plants plus the maintenance and upgrade of existing ones that’s great in theory but up to now it has yet to generate any orders or revenue the other segment of lightbridge’s business model is its nuclear strategy and consultation work to global governments and commercial operations it has a large and wellrespected team here including the former head of advanced nuclear fuel design at general electric ge the former head of nuclear technology at westinghouse the former head of the international atomic energy agency and a slew of former nuclear regulators from several different countries since lightbridge isn’t generating revenue from its technology the company’s consultation work is the crux of its business needless to say relying on just one segment for revenue is pretty risky given that business will rise and fall unfortunately lightbridge has experienced more downs than ups recently in  revenue from its consulting segment sank by  pulling in  million compared to the  million it generated in  hopefully the varans deal will produce an upturn here chaos meter  scalability  it’s fair to say that lightbridge is “all in” on its technology if it gains widespread traction it will finally transform the company’s fortunes if not… well it would spell disaster lightbridge does boast strong established relationships through its consulting segment and in order to grow it intends to license its nuclear fuel design to existing nuclear fuel fabricators it’s also looking for fuel fabricators that have longterm fuel supply contracts with nuclear power plants the structure of these licensing agreements will likely require major fuel suppliers to share fuel development costs also fuel suppliers will need to pay an upfront technology access fee to lightbridge plus royalties from future fuel sales the company believes that continued heavy rd spending coupled with product demonstrations will ensure commercial licensing contracts in roughly one to two years i’m skeptical… successful commercialization is multipronged and one of those prongs requires expensive marketing costs to potential fuel fabricator customers while the other requires raising government awareness despite lightbridge’s solid team of former government agency heads it doesn’t help speed the exorbitant time that government processes tend to take this is evidenced by the company’s prolonged efforts since  given its financial situation time is a luxury that lightbridge does not have chaos meter  overall chaos ranking  final verdict an investment in lightbridge is an investment in thorium and metallic fuels or more accurately an investment in the belief that thorium will become a major source of nuclear energy given its abundance and environmental benefits over uranium it’s likely that thorium will have a growing role in the nuclear industry but it’s not a certainty – and not anytime soon either even lightbridge’s own timeline doesn’t project ample commercialization until beyond  in the meantime it’ll be spending much more on researching and developing its metallic fuel than its consulting business can keep up with and that’s the problem… lightbridge’s nearterm life expectancy seems rather fragile if anything the best i can say is that this is a “prechaos” company whose main catalysts at the moment come from newsdriven events rather than its own disruptive breakthroughs your eyes in the pipeline marty biancuzzo related articles legal mandate sparks x profit opportunity schizophrenic investing the  personality types of investors holding my feet to the fire… two small stocks one giant mystery comments  art frewin says august   at  am thanks for the article seems over priced to me they have established a pretty good marketing plan and they have convinced me if the technology is there that it will be the future of electrical and all sorts of power that being said economic structure does not change quickly at my age trying to reap the benifits through investment is probably remote the real problem is now a days no one wants to comprise when it comes to the enviroment and nothing is black and white dirty coal lets not use it that will work for a while  but when it comes to turning off the electricity because there is not enough to go around then we will see just how uncomprising they can be reply martin says august   at  am thorium…gimme a break it has been in the works for like  years and they never got it to work doubt these guys can make it viable also it is a lie that thorium is safer in terms of waste it is actually worse replyalan replyaugust th  at  pmthorium has indeed been successfully used in nuclear reactors but the best way to do it is in a molten salt reactor which is not what these guys are pushing of course eventually most reactors are likely to be powered by thorium but given the lack of crisis in uranium availability that will take longer than it should the msrbased thorium reactor liquid fluoride thorium reactor or lftr is the most common term does reduce the waste stream significantly due to much more complete fuel burnup and the end waste products are relatively shortlived hundreds of years vs ’s in addition
