major companies give summary accounts of their performance and progress in  chairman’s letter after  years as chairman philip laders final report to share owners in praise of the long view wpp ceo sir martin sorrell on the group’s th anniversary another record year and the outlook for marketing services fast read a quick predigested highlycompressed version of the  annual report who we are wpp is the world leader in communications services it comprises leading companies in all these disciplines advertising media investment management data investment management public relations  public affairs branding  identity healthcare communications direct digital promotion  relationship marketing specialist communications there are more than  companies within the group – and each is a distinctive brand in its own right each has its own identity commands its own loyalty and is committed to its own specialist expertise that is their individual strength clients seek their talent and their experience on a brandbybrand basis between them our companies work with  of the fortune global  all  of the dow jones  and  of the nasdaq  it is also of increasing value to clients that wpp companies and their people can work together as increasingly they do providing a tailormade range of integrated communications services nearly  clients are now served in three distinct disciplines over  clients are served in four disciplines and these clients account for over  of group revenues group companies also work with nearly  clients across six or more countries collectively almost  people including associates work for wpp companies out of over  offices in  countries company listings why we exist our mission to develop and manage talentto apply that talent throughout the world for the benefit of clients to do so in partnership to do so with profit within wpp our clients have access to companies with all the necessary marketing and communications skills companies with strong and distinctive cultures of their own famous names many of them wpp the parent company complements these companies in three distinct ways first it relieves them of much administrative work financial matters such as planning budgeting reporting control treasury tax mergers acquisitions investor relations legal affairs and internal audit are coordinated centrally second the parent company encourages and enables operating companies of different disciplines to work together for the benefit of clients it also plays an acrossthegroup role in the management of talent property procurement it knowledge sharing practice development and sustainability and finally wpp itself can function as the stcentury equivalent of the fullservice agency for some clients predominantly those with a vast geographical spread and a need for a wide range of marketing services wpp can act as a portal to provide a single point of contact and accountability read why we exist what we think in praise of the long view by sir martin sorrell champions of the long view are becoming harder to find boardrooms in the west at least are more likely to be inhabited by the ghosts of lehman than john maynard keynes’ animal spirits consequently targets are often reached not by maximising revenues but by minimising costs – including marketing spend despite the challenges our business performed well in  which was another record year for the group we expect the pattern for  to be much the same a bit of a slog but a satisfactory result at the end of it ahead of last year looking further into the future corporate minds will eventually turn to investment and growth and marketing services will be one of the principal beneficiaries throughout our three decades of existence taking the long view has worked well for wpp and its stakeholders we have the right strategy to take advantage of the fundamental shifts – both technological and geographical – shaping our industry we continue to focus on new markets new media data investment management and the application of technology and ‘horizontality’ read sir martin sorrell’s article you may not know where you’re going until you’ve got there which is why the best brief may be the brand by jeremy bullmore in business particularly in marketing we seem to be at least as reluctant as scientists to come clean about our processes of thought read jeremy bullmore’s essay four strategic priorities our goal remains to be the world’s most admired and respected communications services advisor to global multinational regional and local companies to that end we have four core strategic priorities increase the combined geographic share of revenues from the fastergrowing markets of asia pacific latin america africa  middle east and central  eastern europe to  of revenues increase the share of revenues of new media to  of revenues maintain the share of more measurable marketing services – such as data investment management and direct digital and interactive – at  of revenues with a focus on the application of new technology big data and digital advance ‘horizontality’ by ensuring our people work together for the benefit of clients primarily through two horizontal
