information technology  tokyo japan deep security overview tis is a system integrator that has more than  years of history it boasts rich knowhow concerning credit card and payment system and has advanced technical capabilities and it took the decision to expand the cardspring cloud service of the american company cardspring as a new service that leverages these strengths cardspring is a clo card linked offer service that is provided via paas platform as a service it enables digital coupons and credit card usage information to be linked and incentives points discount etc to be provided to card users clo is gaining an increasing amount of attention as it offers the convenience of not requiring user to print coupons out as they normally would and tis is promoting collaboration and linking between payment processors and media vendors in order to provide a service that can be used at any store and with any card furthermore the service allows member stores to track the attributes of coupon users newregular usernumber of visits etc and enables the users eligible to receive coupons to be narrowed down as well as an accurate understanding of the effect of coupons to be gained cardspring is an extremely effective platform from which member stores can refine and optimize measures to attract new customers but there is much card information that is handled by the infrastructure so watertight security is demanded in addition the cardspring service is implemented in connection with cardspring in the usa and when the service was rolled out in japan the cardspring japan infrastructure had to meet the requirements of cardspring usa this meant compliance with pci dss as daisuke yoshikawa of tis’s advanced solutions department which is in charge of the cardspring business recalls “that meant as long as we didn’t have pci dss certification we couldn’t launch cardspring in japan” the only way of completing this important task was by using trend micro deep security™ solution when making cardspring’s japan infrastructure compliant with pci dss mr yoshikawa asked for the full cooperation of tis’s it infrastructure service department this department is involved in the design construction and operation of it infrastructure and provides pci dss certification consulting services both internally and externally one of the security solutions selected by this department in accordance with the demands placed upon it to achieve pci dss compliance with minimal cost and effort was deep security all of the critical servers in cardspring’s infrastructure in japan now have a deep security agent built in and security measures have been comprehensively implemented to meet pci dss requirements these measures include antivirus software change monitoring prevention of tampering with important files and virtual patch application measures against vulnerabilities through ipsids functions teppei eguchi of the it infrastructure service department explains the benefits of deep security as a pci dss solution as follows “normally when you try to implement measures like antitampering and antivirus measures for reasons such as pci dss compliance you need a different tool for each measure so not only does the burden of implementation and operation increase but you also have setup a control server for each tool in contrast by using deep security you can cover multiple pci dss requirements and can control and run multiple countermeasures from a single control server as such the burden of implementation and operation is small and you don’t need to use multiple it solutions in order to ensure security” the cardspring infrastructure in japan is deployed in a data center managed and operated by tis and the whole network is protected by elements including firewall appliances and ips appliances in this configuration tis utilizes the ips functions of deep security the reasons for which are explained below by masaru miyazaki of the it infrastructure service department deep security combines a wide variety of functions into a single product and many security requirements can be met using only one control server as such implementation and operational load can be kept to a minimum and server resources can be used effectively this is an advantage worthy of special note  teppei eguchi tis inc   “for example if you use the deep security’s host ips functions you are able to detect attacks that are usually difficult to detect with ips appliances on a network such as communication encrypted with ssl and deal with them in other words we use deep security to compensate for the gaps present when using appliances alone and raise the overall level of security” results with the implementation and utilization of deep security tis made the cardspring infrastructure pci dss compliant acquired pci dss certification in around six months tis put the infrastructure into operation on december st    in light of this result mr yoshikawa explains the advantages of the implementation as follows “for us the acquisition of pci dss certification was an extremely large task the thing that allowed us to achieve this without any holdups was because we managed to cover many pci dss requirements with deep security” mr yoshikawa also highly rates the ease of deep security operation “cardspring has a lot of information that has to be managed and much time is taken up by overall operation and so in light of this the fact that you can manage file tampering measures antivirus measures and other measures from a single screen is very significant in terms of security patch application to deal with vulnerabilities as well in our operating style we automatically detect vulnerabilities on a server with the “recommended scan” provided by deep security and apply virtual patches this kind of efficiency is very helpful” according to mryoshikawa plans are afoot at tis to expand and enhance the payment service and there is a high potential that the use of deep security will increase even further furthermore mr miyazaki and mreguchi want to make deep security one of their configuration options for pci dss for customers and mr miyazaki is considering the use of deep security to deal with operating system obsolescence such as when support for windows server 0 ends in order to perform the considerable task of acquiring pci dss certification deep security with its support for multiple pci dss requirements was extremely useful this product really helped us to achieve our goal  daisuke

what we needed” systems integrator tis is active in providing the very best in optimized solutions to its clients the company needed to reconfigure its sales process support system to meet rapidly growing needs in internal control response and sales process innovation for its new system tis chose to adopt fujitsu primergy bx s blade servers that could accommodate the company’s future growth deploying a san boot environment would also provide the high availability needed to ensure enterprise applications stayed up and running tis and fujitsu also worked together to accomplish the cutover before the approaching deadline installation background tis facing increasing compliance requirements effectiveness and efficiency issues in its sales processes mr tsuneyoshi ito head of business administration office corporate planning division tis inc as a leader in the everevolving it industry tis inc has continued to grow based on its business philosophy “pursuing optimum solutions for clients” using its distinct innovative advantages and technical knowhow the company strives to provide the very best solutions and build ideal it environments for customers across a wide variety of sectors including financiers manufacturers retailers etc tis has also been successfully enhancing its global organizational structure mainly focusing on china and vietnam in order to meet diverse demands in an everchanging marketplace tis as a bestpractice it solutions partner always tries to resolve customers’ it problems by creating new business models using its consultation capability recently tis has been dedicating itself to helping companies with internal control requirements without exception increasing internal controls have become an inevitable issue for tis itself in particular compliance with japanese internal control requirements and correspondence to the accounting standards required of information services providers due to its rapid growth administrative work at tis was continually increasing with the company struggling with inefficiency issues in its sales process “with our previous sales process we were required to create a report each time we wanted to proceed and then obtain management approval if the approvers were out of office or busy our workflow just stuck there it was obvious without developing an effective and efficient process we would not be able to be responsive to our customers in the near future the situation would become worse after internal controls were put in place as complying with the new requirements would generate extra procedures this ultimately would take even longer to submit quotations to customers” states tsuneyoshi ito head of business administration office corporate planning division tis inc tis decided to implement a new system that would support sales process innovation and started looking for a solution to accommodate internal control assurance and improve sales process efficiency they were already at the end of 0 and their deadline date was fast approaching the fujitsu offer comprehensive support from fujitsu enabled timelimited cutover mr takashi okamoto chief examiner financial systems division financial card business group tis inc   “tis had two main objectives when we decided to implement a new system maintain audit trails and improve sales department administrative work efficiency basically we planed to improve our workflow by consolidating administrative functions we also wanted to automate risk management for internal controlrelated matters to create an efficient process automated management also would make it possible to reduce the need to hire more employees when the internal controls are put in place which would cause separation of duties one of the most costly concepts of internal controls” says ito first of all tis needed to consolidate the administrative tasks previously performed by each individual system and then build unified management of the company’s important evidence records creating a timesaving sales process was also essential in helping sales staff focus on more important tasks “for example creating guidance to help the sales process can save sales staff time as　they don’t need to consult manuals it also reduces the possibility of mistakes and the risks that brings we also planned to make it possible for order and acceptance forms to be viewed as images at any time enabling sales staff to quickly prepare for any audits” ito continues at that time tis had a welldefined set of system requirements for achieving the initial objectives according to takashi okamoto a chief examiner in the financial systems division within the financial card business group at tis “most importantly the system had to be up and running  hours a day  days a week to support the enterprise applications in addition fast response had to be ensured to support daytoday use and scalability was required to accommodate future growth in the company based on those requirements we expected to deploy the new system in an affordable manner and to achieve a reduction in tco” mr katsuya oyama financial systems division financial card business group tis inc   in addition to their system requirements tis had another critical issue to be resolved a strict time limit “as we needed to comply with governmentmandated regulatory requirements the deadline of march 0 would become the most important and the most difficult issue there was absolutely no way that we could miss that deadline tis looked for a trusted partner who could help us complete the timelimited cutover without compromising our critical system requirements as tis did not have sufficient resources fujitsu’s comprehensive offerings including engineering support gave us the confidence that fujitsu would do a great job in providing what we needed” states okamoto katsuya oyama also from the financial systems department adds “i believed fujitsu’s comprehensive solutions’ knowhow would be a huge help in saving time and making it faster to revamp our system besides fujitsu has extensive experience in support services including support of red hat linux taking all those benefits into consideration we thought fujitsu was the one that we could work with” configured system tis achieves infrastructure optimization while reducing tco tis chose to adopt fujitsu primergy bx s blade servers as the core infrastructure of the company’s new system “in addition to their spacesaving form factor blade servers had scaleout capability while ensuring a reduction in system running costs the sanconnected storage device could be shared by each individual blade providing dynamic resource utilization for the new system tis implemented a san boot environment to achieve n redundancy that addressed our missioncritical requirements in an affordable manner” oyama says “tis also considered and installed fujitsu’s infrastructure management software systemwalker resource coordinator and systemwalker centric manager this enables switchover capability in the n redundant configuration the integrated management tools have great ability to detect failures both in hardware and applications and take a proactive approach to ensuring prompt switchover in the event of a system failure” continues oyama along with the primergy servers tis adopted a fujitsu ipcom s network server acts both as a firewall and a load balancer enabling tis to save costs for its database server tis turned to fujitsu primequest an intel®architecture ultrareliable server that features vertical scalability scaleup mirror redundancy and clustering for storage tis selected a fujitsu eternus  model  this storage device has the ensured capability of highspeed backup addressing one of tiss requirements of storing three years of data on disk so that the stored data can be retrieved at any time in addition fujitsus automation software suite significantly reduces manual processing and the time and costs required for system management a job scheduling tool systemwalker operation manager automates batch processing and backup systemwalker centric manager automates server monitoring functions and provide the ability to automatically deliver error messages while fujitsu systemwalker resource coordinator provides an automated switchover capability future scenarios tis is planning to take another approach to achieve infrastructure optimization across the entire organization with support from fujitsu tis started revamping its sales department system in may 0 with the planned new system scheduled to go into production in march 0 at time of writingth feb 0 testing of the new infrastructure has already been completed and tis is entering the final phase to conduct tests on the new applications the new sales process system working with financial systems sales management systems and profit management systems is designed to build a unified management structure that allows tis to maintain audit trails and records consistently the new system will be a huge help in speeding up the sales and decisionmaking processes making it possible for tis to be much more responsive to customers “tis selected fujitsu platforms and we expect the adopted products will be supported over five years we highly recognize fujitsu products in terms of reliability highperformance support services and succession fujitsu did much to help us improve our it system and we would like to ask their continuing cooperation and support in the future too as it professionals in the industry tis believes that we can establish a trusted relationship with fujitsu and hope that business relationship will last for a long time” okamoto says indicating his expectations ito explains the system expansion plans of the company “tis is now planning to implement similar systems in our group companies it system renovation this time in our sales department is part of companywide initiatives to accomplish infrastructure optimization across the entire organization tis will keep working hard to create innovative and optimized business processes not only for each department but for the entire company” about tis inc headquarters tis takeshiba building  kaigan chome minatoku tokyo 0 japan founded  april  9 capital stock 0 million japanese yen as of march  0
