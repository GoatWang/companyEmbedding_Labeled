representative in australia of the australian monarch currently queen elizabeth ii the governorgeneral is appointed by the queen on the advice of the prime minister of australia the governorgeneral has formal presidency over the federal executive council and is commanderinchief of the australian defence force as well as viceregal representative in the australian capital territory the functions of the governorgeneral include appointing ministers judges and ambassadors giving royal assent to legislation passed by parliament issuing writs for election and bestowing australian honours in general the governorgeneral observes the conventions of the westminster system and responsible government maintaining a political neutrality and has almost always acted only on the advice of the prime minister or other ministers or in certain cases the parliament the governorgeneral also has a ceremonial role hosting events at either of the two viceregal residences—government house in the capital canberra and admiralty house in sydney—and travelling throughout australia to open conferences attend services and commemorations and generally provide encouragement to individuals and groups who are contributing to their communities when travelling abroad the governorgeneral is seen as the representative of australia and of the queen of australia the governorgeneral is supported by a staff headed by the official secretary to the governorgeneral a governorgeneral is not appointed for a specific term but is generally expected to serve for five years subject to a possible short extension since  march  the governorgeneral has been general sir peter cosgrove from federation in  until   out of the  governorsgeneral were british aristocrats they included four barons three viscounts three earls

selection of a governorgeneral is a responsibility for the prime minister of australia who may consult privately with staff or colleagues or with the monarch the candidate is approached privately to confirm whether they are willing to accept the appointment the prime minister then advises the monarch to appoint his nominee this has been the procedure since november  when james scullins proposed appointment of sir isaac isaacs was fiercely opposed by the british government this was not because of any lack of regard for isaacs personally but because the british government considered that the choice of governorsgeneral was since the  imperial conference a matter for the monarchs decision alone however it became very clear in a conversation between scullin and king george vs private secretary lord stamfordham on  november  that this was merely the official reason for the objection with the real reason being that an australian no matter how highly regarded personally was not considered appropriate to be a governorgeneral scullin was equally insistent that the monarch must act on the relevant prime ministers direct advice the practice until  was that dominion prime ministers advised the monarch indirectly through the british government which effectively had a veto over any proposal it did not agree with scullin cited the precedents of the prime minister of south africa j b m hertzog who had recently insisted on his choice of the earl of clarendon as governorgeneral of that country and the selection of an irishman as governorgeneral of the irish free state both of these appointments had been agreed to despite british government objections despite these precedents george v remained reluctant to accept scullins recommendation of isaacs and asked him to consider field marshal sir william birdwood however scullin stood firm and on  november the king agreed to isaacss appointment but made it clear that he did so only because he felt he had no option this right to not only advise the monarch directly but also to expect that advice to be accepted was soon taken up by all the other dominion prime ministers this among other things led to the statute of westminster  and to the formal separation of the crowns of the dominions now the queen of australia is generally bound by constitutional convention to accept the advice of the australian prime minister and state premiers about australian and state constitutional matters respectively having agreed to the appointment the monarch then permits it to be publicly announced in advance usually several months before the end of the current governorgenerals term during these months the person is referred to as the governorgeneraldesignate the actual appointment is made by the monarch after receiving his or her commission the governorgeneral takes an oath of allegiance to the australian monarch an oath of office undertaking to serve australias monarch according to law in the office of governorgeneral of the commonwealth of australia and issues a proclamation assuming office the oaths are usually taken in a ceremony on the floor of the senate and are administered by the chief justice of australia in the presence of the prime minister of australia the speaker of the australian house of representatives and the president of the australian senatecitation needed styles and titles of governorsgeneraledit governorsgeneral have during their tenure the style hisher excellency the honourable and their spouses have the style hisher excellency since may  the style used by a former governorgeneral is the honourable it was at the same time retrospectively granted for life to all previous holders of the office from the creation of the order of australia in  the governorgeneral was ex officio chancellor and principal companion of the order and therefore became entitled to the postnominal ac in  the letters patent for the order were amended to introduce the rank of knight and dame to the order and from that time the governorgeneral became ex officio the chancellor and principal knight of the order in  the letters patent were amended again and governorsgeneral appointed from that time were again ex officio entitled to the postnominal ac although if they already held a knighthood in the order that superior rank was retained until  all governorsgeneral were members of the privy council of the united kingdom and thus held the additional style the right honourable for life the same individuals were also usually either peers knights or both the only australian peer to be appointed as governorgeneral was the lord casey and sir william mckell was knighted only in  some years into his term but he was entitled to the style the honourable during his tenure as premier of new south wales an office he held until almost immediately before his appointment in  bill hayden a republican declined appointment to the british privy council and any imperial honours from that time until  governorsgeneral did not receive automatic titles or honours other than the postnominal ac by virtue of being chancellor and principal companion of the order of australia dame quentin bryce was the first governorgeneral to have had no prior title or prenominal style she was in office when on  march  the queen acting on the advice of prime minister tony abbott amended the letters patent of the order of australia to provide inter alia that the governorgeneral would be ex officio principal knight or principal dame of the order until  the honour continued after the retirement from office of the governorgeneral formerly the governorgeneral automatically became a knight or dame if he or she was not already one previously upon being sworn in backgrounds of governorsgeneraledit all the governorsgeneral until  were british born except for australianborn sir isaac isaacs – and sir william mckell – there have been only australian occupants since then although sir ninian stephen – had been born in britain prince henry duke of gloucester was a senior member of the royal family dame quentin bryce governorgeneral  was the first woman to be appointed to the office sir isaac isaacs and sir zelman cowen were jewish bill hayden is an avowed atheist and he made an affirmation rather than swear an oath at the beginning of his commission the remaining governorsgeneral have been at least nominally christian various governorgeneral had previously served as governors of an australian state or colony lord hopetoun victoria – lord tennyson south australia – lord gowrie south australia – and new south wales – major general michael jeffery western australia – dame quentin bryce queensland – sir ronald munro ferguson had been offered the governorship of south australia in  and of victoria in  but refused both appointments lord northcote was governor of bombay lord casey was governor of bengal in between his periods of service to the australian parliament former leading politicians and members of the judiciary have figured prominently lord dudley was lord lieutenant of ireland – lord stonehaven as john baird was minister for transport in the cabinets of bonar law and stanley baldwin and after his return to britain he became chairman of the uk conservative party sir isaac isaacs was successively commonwealth attorneygeneral a high court judge and chief justice sir william mckell was premier of new south wales lord dunrossil as william morrison was speaker of the uk house of commons lord de lisle was secretary of state for air in winston churchills cabinet – more recent governorsgeneral in this category include lord casey sir paul hasluck sir john kerr sir ninian stephen bill hayden and sir william deane of the ten australians appointed governorgeneral since  lord casey sir paul hasluck and bill hayden were former federal parliamentarians sir john kerr was the chief justice of the supreme court of new south wales sir ninian stephen and sir william deane were appointed from the bench of the high court sir zelman cowen was a vicechancellor of the university of queensland and constitutional lawyer peter hollingworth was the anglican archbishop of brisbane and majorgeneral michael jeffery was a retired military officer and former governor of western australia quentin bryces appointment was announced during her term as governor of queensland she had previously been the federal sex discrimination commissioner significant postretirement activities of earlier governorsgeneral have included lord tennyson was appointed deputy governor of the isle of wight sir ronald munro ferguson by now lord novar became secretary of state for scotland and lord gowrie became chairman of the marylebone cricket club lord forster had also held this post before his appointment as governorgeneral tenureedit the constitution does not set a term of office so a governorgeneral may continue to hold office for any agreed length of time however a typical term of office is five years at the end of this period a commission is occasionally extended for a short time the salary of the governorgeneral is regulated by the constitution which fixed an annual amount of  pounds unless the parliament decides otherwise the salary of the governorgeneral cannot be altered during his or her term of office under the governorgeneral act  cth each new commission has resulted in a pay increase today the law ensures the salary is higher than that for the chief justice of the high court over a fiveyear period the annual salary during michael jefferys term was  quentin bryces salary was  the current salary is  and there is a generous pension until  governorsgeneral did not pay income tax on their salary this was changed after the queen agreed to pay tax three governorsgeneral have resigned their commission the first governorgeneral lord hopetoun asked to be recalled to britain in  over a dispute about funding for the post sir john kerr resigned in  with his official reason being his decision to accept the position of australian ambassador to unesco in paris a post which ultimately he did not take up in  archbishop peter hollingworth voluntarily stood aside while controversial allegations against him were managed and the letters patent of the office were amended to take account of this circumstance he later stepped down over the churchs handling of allegations of sexual abuse of boys for which he apologised before the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse in  in  lord dunrossil became the first and to date only governorgeneral to die while holding office a governorgeneral may be recalled or dismissed by the monarch before their term is complete by convention this may only be upon advice from the prime minister who retains responsibility for selecting an immediate replacement or letting the vacancy provisions take effect no australian governorgeneral has ever been dismissed and it is unclear how quickly the monarch would act on such advice the constitutional crisis of  raised the possibility of the prime minister and the governorgeneral attempting to dismiss each other at the same time a vacancy occurs on the resignation death or incapacity of the governorgeneral a temporary vacancy occurs when the governorgeneral is overseas on official business representing australia a temporary vacancy also occurred in  when peter hollingworth stood aside section  of the constitution allows the queen to appoint an administrator to carry out the role of governorgeneral when there is a vacancy by convention the longestserving state governor holds a dormant commission allowing an assumption of office to commence whenever a vacancy occurs in  labor prime minister gough whitlam advised the queen that sir colin hannah then governor of queensland should have his dormant commission revoked for having made public political statements constitutional role and functionsedit the neutrality of this section is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met december  learn how and when to remove this template message further information australian head of state dispute the constitution of australia section  provides a governorgeneral appointed by the queen shall be her majestys representative in the commonwealth and shall have and may exercise in the commonwealth during the queens pleasure but subject to this constitution such powers and functions of the queen as her majesty may be pleased to assign to him such further powers are currently set out in letters patent of  from queen elizabeth ii these contain no substantive powers but provide for the case of a governorgenerals absence or incapacity the constitution also provides that the governorgeneral is the monarchs representative in exercising the executive power of the commonwealth section  and as commanderinchief of the armed forces section  australian solicitorgeneral maurice byers stated in  the constitutional prescription is that executive power is exercisable by the governorgeneral although vested in the queen what is exercisable is original executive power that is the very thing vested in the queen by section  and it is exercisable by the queens representative not her delegate or agent the letters patent issued by queen victoria in  creating the office of governorgeneral the  constitutional commission report explained the governorgeneral is in no sense a delegate of the queen the independence of the office is highlighted by changes which have been made in recent years to the royal instruments relating to it the changes occurred in  when queen victorias letters patent and instructions were revoked and replaced with new letters patent on prime minister bob hawkes advice who stated that this would clarify the governorgenerals position under the constitution this remains the case even when the sovereign is in the country solicitorgeneral kenneth bailey prior to the first tour of australia by its reigning monarch in  explained the position by saying the constitution expressly vests in the governorgeneral the power or duty to perform a number of the crowns functions in the legislature and the executive government of the commonwealth the executive power of the commonwealth by section  of the constitution is declared to be vested in the queen it is also in the same section declared to be exercisable by the governorgeneral as the queens representative in the face of this provision i feel it is difficult to contend that the queen even though present in australia may exercise in person functions of executive government which are specifically assigned by the constitution to the governorgeneral as early as  the authoritative commentary by quick and garran had noted that the governorgeneral of australia was distinguished from other empire governorsgeneral by the fact that the principal and most important of his powers and functions legislative as well as executive are expressly conferred on him by the terms of the constitution itself  not by royal authority but by statutory authority this view was also held by senior judge of the supreme court of tasmania andrew inglis clark who with w harrison moore a contributor to the first draft of the constitution put before the  adelaide convention and professor of law at the university of melbourne postulated that the letters patent and the royal instructions issued by queen victoria were unnecessary or even of doubtful legality the monarch chose not to intervene during the  australian constitutional crisis in which governorgeneral sir john kerr dismissed the labor government of gough whitlam on the basis that such a decision is a matter clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the governorgeneral through her private secretary she wrote that she has no part in the decisions which the governorgeneral must take in accordance with the constitution in an address to the sydney institute january  in connection with that event sir david smith a retired official secretary to the governorgeneral of australia described the constitution as conferring the powers and functions of australias head of state on the governorgeneral in his own right he stated that the governorgeneral was more than a representative of the sovereign explaining under section  of the constitution the governorgeneral is the queens representative and exercises certain royal prerogative powers and functions under section  of the constitution the governorgeneral is the holder of a quite separate and independent office created not by the crown but by the constitution and empowered to exercise in his own right as governorgeneral all the powers and functions of australias head of state role in australias parliamentedit the constitution describes the parliament of the commonwealth as consisting of the queen the senate and the house of representatives section  states that the governorgeneral may appoint such times for holding the sessions of the parliament  prorogue the parliament and dissolve the house of representatives these provisions make it clear that the queens role in the parliament is in name only and the actual responsibility belongs to the governorgeneral such decisions are usually taken on the advice of the prime minister although that is not stated in the constitution the governorgeneral has a ceremonial role in swearing in and accepting the resignations of members of parliament they appoint a deputy to whom members make an oath of allegiance before they take their seats on the day parliament opens the governorgeneral makes a speech entirely written by the government explaining the governments proposed legislative program the most important power is found in section  when a proposed law passed by both houses of parliament is presented to the governorgeneral for the queens assent he shall declare  that he assents in the queens name the royal assent brings such laws into effect as legislation from the date of signing sections  to  allow the governorgeneral to withhold assent suggest changes refer to the queen or proclaim that the queen has annulled the legislation a number of governorsgeneral have reserved royal assent for particular legislation for the queen such assent has usually been given during a scheduled visit to australia by the queen on other occasions royal assent has been given elsewhere examples of this have been the flags act  the royal styles and titles acts  and  and the australia act  role in executive governmentedit at the start of chapter  on executive government the constitution says the executive power of the commonwealth is vested in the queen and is exercisable by the governorgeneral as the queens representative the governorgeneral presides over a federal executive council by convention the prime minister is appointed to this council and advises as to which parliamentarians shall become ministers and parliamentary secretaries in the constitution the words governorgeneralincouncil mean the governorgeneral acting with the advice of the council powers exercised in council which are not reserve powers include establishing government departments appointing federal judges and appointing ambassadors and high commissioners all such actions are taken on the advice of ministers section  says commandinchief of naval and military forces  is vested in the governorgeneral as the queens representative in practice that role is ceremonial with actual authority in the hands of the defence minister and the chief of the defence force cdf in an administrative sense the office of governorgeneral is regulated by the governorgeneral act  reserve powersedit in the united kingdom the reserve powers of the monarch which are typically referred to as the royal prerogative are not explicitly stated in constitutional enactments and are the province of convention and common law in australia however the powers are explicitly given to the governorgeneral in the constitution it is their use that is the subject of convention the reserve powers are the power to dissolve or refuse to dissolve the house of representatives section  of the constitution the power to dissolve parliament on the occasion of a deadlock section  the power to withhold assent to bills section  the power to appoint or dismiss ministers section  those powers are generally and routinely exercised on ministerial advice but the governorgeneral retains the ability to act independently in certain circumstances as governed by convention it is generally held that the governorgeneral may use powers without ministerial advice in the following situations if an election results in a parliament in which no party has a majority the governorgeneral may select the prime minister if a prime minister loses the support of the house of representatives the governorgeneral may appoint a new prime minister if a prime minister advises a dissolution of the house of representatives the governorgeneral may refuse that request or request further reasons why it should be granted it is worth noting that convention does not give the governorgeneral the ability to dissolve either the house of representatives or the senate without advice the use of the reserve powers may arise in the following circumstances if a prime minister advises a dissolution of parliament on the occasion of a deadlock between the houses the governorgeneral may refuse that request if the governorgeneral is not satisfied with a legislative bill as presented they may refuse royal assent if a prime minister resigns after losing a vote of confidence the governorgeneral may select a new replacement contrary to the advice of the outgoing prime minister if a prime minister is unable to obtain supply and refuses to resign or advise a dissolution the governorgeneral may dismiss him or her and appoint a new prime minister the above is not an exhaustive list and new situations may arise the most notable use of the reserve powers occurred in november  in the course of the  australian constitutional crisis on this occasion the governorgeneral sir john kerr dismissed the government of gough whitlam when the senate withheld supply to the government even though whitlam retained the confidence of the house of representatives kerr determined that he had both the right and the duty to dismiss the government and commission a new government that would recommend a dissolution of the parliamentcitation needed events surrounding the dismissal remain extremely controversial ceremonial roleedit viscount dunrossil th governorgeneral of australia  in his court uniform with his viceregal consort viscountess dunrossil in addition to the formal constitutional role the governorgeneral has a representative and ceremonial role though the extent and nature of that role has depended on the expectations of the time the individual in office at the time the wishes of the incumbent government and the individuals reputation in the wider community governorsgeneral generally become patrons of various charitable institutions present honours and awards host functions for various groups of people including ambassadors to and from other countries and travel widely throughout australia sir william deane governorgeneral  described one of his functions as being chief mourner at prominent funerals in commentaries on the constitution of the commonwealth of australia garran noted that since the australian executive is national in nature being dependent on the nationally elected house of representatives rather than the senate the governorgeneral as the official head of the executive does not in the smallest degree represent any federal element if he represents anything he is the image and embodiment of national unity and the outward and visible representation of the imperial relationship of the commonwealth flag of the governorgeneral of australia since  that role can become controversial however if the governorgeneral becomes unpopular with sections of the community the public role adopted by sir john kerr was curtailed considerably after the constitutional crisis of  sir william deanes public statements on political issues produced some hostility towards him and some charities disassociated themselves from peter hollingworth after the issue of his management of sex abuse cases during his time as anglican archbishop of brisbane became a matter of controversy at one time governorsgeneral wore the traditional court uniform consisting of a dark navy wool doublebreasted coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the royal arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oakleaf braid down the outside seam silver sword belt with ceremonial sword bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers black patent leather wellington boots with spurs etc that is worn on ceremonial occasions there is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet however that custom fell into disuse during the tenure of sir paul hasluck the governorgeneral now wears an ordinary lounge suit if a man or day dress if a

instead of number plates a similar arrangement is used for the governors of the six states when the queen is in australia the queens personal australian flag is flown on the car in which she is travelling during the queens  visit to australia she and the duke of edinburgh were driven in a range rover vogue historyedit the earl of hopetoun the first governorgeneral – sir isaac isaacs the first australianborn governorgeneral – the office of governorgeneral was previously used during the midth century in australia sir charles fitzroy governor of new south wales from – and sir william denison governor of new south wales from – also carried the additional title of governorgeneral because their jurisdiction extended to other colonies in australia the office of governorgeneral for the commonwealth of australia was conceived during the debates and conventions leading up to federation the first governorgeneral the earl of hopetoun was a previous governor of victoria he was appointed in july  returning to australia shortly before the inauguration of the commonwealth of australia on  january  after the initial confusion of the hopetoun blunder he appointed the first prime minister of australia edmund barton to a caretaker government with the inaugural  federal election not occurring until march early governorsgeneral were british and were appointed by the queen or king on the recommendation of the colonial office the australian government was merely asked as a matter of courtesy whether they approved of the choice or not governorsgeneral were expectedby whom to exercise a supervisory role over the australian government in the manner of a colonial governor in a very real sense they represented the british government they had the right to reserve legislation passed by the parliament of australia in other words to ask the colonial office in london for an opinion before giving the royal assent they exercised this power several times the queen that is the uk monarch acting upon advice of the british government could also disallow any australian legislation up to a year after the governorgeneral had given it the assent although this power has never been used these powers remain in the constitution but today are regarded as dead letters the early governorsgeneral frequently sought advice on the exercise of their powers from two judges of the high court of australia sir samuel griffith and sir edmund barton that practice has continued from time to time during the s the importance of the position declined as a result of decisions made at the  imperial conference the governorgeneral ceased to represent the british government diplomatically and the british right of supervision over australian affairs was abolished as the balfour declaration of  later implemented as the statute of westminster  put it it is desirable formally to place on record a definition of the position held by the governorgeneral as his majestys representative in the dominions that position though now generally well recognised undoubtedly represents a development from an earlier stage when the governorgeneral was appointed solely on the advice of his majestys ministers in london and acted also as their representative in our opinion it is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the british commonwealth of nations that the governorgeneral of a dominion is the representative of the crown holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the dominion as is held by his majesty the king in great britain and that he is not the representative or agent of his majestys government in great britain or of any department of that government however it remained unclear just whose prerogative it now became to decide who new governorsgeneral would be in  king george v and the australian prime minister james scullin discussed the appointment of a new governorgeneral to replace lord stonehaven whose term was coming to an end the king maintained that it was now his sole prerogative to choose a governorgeneral and he wanted fieldmarshal sir william birdwood for the australian post scullin recommended the australian jurist sir isaac isaacs and he insisted that george v act on the advice of his australian prime minister in this matter scullin was partially influenced by the precedent set by the government of the irish free state which always insisted upon having an irishman as the governorgeneral of the irish free state the king approved scullins choice albeit with some displeasure the usual wording of official announcements of this nature read the king has been pleased to appoint  but on this occasion the announcement said merely the king has appointed  and his private secretary lord stamfordham asked the solicitorgeneral sir robert garran to make sure scullin was aware of the exact wording the opposition nationalist party of australia denounced the appointment as practically republican but scullin had set a precedent the convention gradually became established throughout the commonwealth that the governorgeneral is a citizen of the country concerned and is appointed on the advice of the government of that country in  the transformation was concluded with the appointment of the first australian governorgeneral isaacs and the first british representative in australia ernest crutchley  saw the appointment of the first british high commissioner to australia geoffrey whiskard in office  after scullins defeat in  nonlabor governments continued to recommend british people for appointment as governorgeneral but such appointments remained solely a matter between the australian government and the monarch in  labor appointed a second australian governorgeneral william mckell who was in office as the labor premier of new south wales the then leader of the opposition robert menzies called mckells appointment shocking and humiliating in  the menzies conservative government appointed an australian lord casey and thereafter only australians have held the position suggestions during the early s that the prince of wales might become the governorgeneral came to nothing due to the prospective constitutional difficulty that might ensue if prince charles became kingcitation needed in  media outlets reported that prince william might become governorgeneral of australia both the prime minister john howard and clarence house repudiated the suggestion patronageedit the governorgeneral is generally invited to become patron of various charitable and service organisations historically the governorgeneral has also served as chief scout of australia the chief scout is nominated by the scouting

of the federal executive council which meets at government house canberra after the accession parallel proclamations are made by the governors in each state regardless of any proclamations the late sovereigns heir immediately and automatically succeeds without any need for confirmation or further ceremony following an appropriate period of mourning the monarch is also crowned in the united kingdom though this ritual is not necessary for a sovereign to reign for example edward viii was never crowned yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne after an individual ascends the throne he or she typically continues to reign until death there is no provision in the law for a monarch to unilaterally abdicate the only australian monarch to abdicate edward viii did so as a consequence of abdicating as monarch of the united kingdom with which the australian government had agreedcitation needed personification of the stateedit further information the crown the legal personality of a component of the australian state is sometimes expressed by reference to the sovereign in criminal prosecutions the state as a party is ordinarily named as the queen—for instance the queen v crook however the prosecutors themselves are referred to as representing the crown in the same sense all state lands are called crown land stateowned buildings and equipment are called crownheld property and the copyright for all government publications is called crown copyright where it is not obvious whether the legal personality concerned is the commonwealth one of the australian states or some other state entity the reference is specified as the queen or the crown in right of the entity concerned such as the crown in right of the state of new south wales more commonly and conveniently however the entity is referred to directly—for example as the commonwealth or the state of new south wales or simply new south wales but actions against a government are often brought against the responsible officer ex officio—for example smith v minister for town and country planning or more specifically jones v director of public prosecutions nsw the monarch is also the locus of oaths of allegiance many employees of the crown are required by law to recite this oath before taking their posts such as all members of the commonwealth parliament all members of the state and territorial parliaments as well as all magistrates judges police officers and justices of the peace this is in reciprocation to the sovereigns coronation oath wherein he or she promises to govern the peoples of australia according to their respective laws and customs new appointees to the federal cabinet currently also swear an oath that includes allegiance to the monarch before taking their post however as this oath is not written in law it has not always been observed and depends on the form chosen by the prime minister of the time suggested to the governorgeneral in december  kevin rudd did not swear allegiance to the sovereign when sworn in by the governorgeneral making him the first prime minister not to do so however he like all other members of parliament did swear allegiance to the queen as required by law when sworn in by the governorgeneral as newly elected parliamentarians similarly the oath of citizenship contained a statement of allegiance to the reigning monarch until  when a pledge of allegiance to australia and its values was introduced the high court found in  though that allegiance to the queen of australia was the fundamental criterion of membership in the australian body politic from a constitutional rather than statutory point of view head of stateedit see also australian head of state dispute australias head of state is the monarch and its head of government is the prime minister with powers limited by both law and convention for government to be carried on democratically the constitution provides that the queen is part of the parliament and is empowered to appoint the governorgeneral as her representative while the executive power of the commonwealth which is vested in the queen is exercisable by the governorgeneral as her representative in practice the queen does not play a daytoday role in the government and the few functions which the queen does perform such as appointing the governorgeneral are done on advice from the prime minister the constitution does not directly mention the term head of state the constitution defines the governorgeneral and the state governors as the monarchs representatives while current official sources use the description head of state for the queen in the lead up to the republic referendum in  sir david smith proposed an alternative explanation that australia already had a head of state in the person of the governorgeneral who since  has invariably been an australian citizen this view has some support within the group australians for constitutional monarchy constitutional role and royal prerogativeedit “ we have a very good system now in terms of political stability one of the reasons why we have had this wonderful stability is because of the constitutional linkages from crown to governorgeneral to prime minister at the federal level and crown to governor to premiers at the state level there are checks and balances in the system and that is why we never had civil wars that is why we never had huge political upheavals except in  and  so the system as it is has worked very well ” — governorgeneral michael jeffery  australia act  united kingdom document located in parliament house canberra and bearing the signature of elizabeth ii as queen of the united kingdom australia has a written constitution based on the westminster model of government with some federal elements modelled on the united states constitution and a distinct separation of powers it gives australia a parliamentary system similar to the other commonwealth realms wherein the role of the queen and governorgeneral is both legal and practical the sovereign of australia is represented in the federal sphere by the governorgeneral—appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister of australia—and in each state by a governor—appointed by the monarch upon the advice of the relevant state premiercitation needed executiveedit in australias constitutional system one of the main duties of the governorgeneral is to appoint a prime minister who thereafter heads the cabinet and advises the governorgeneral on how to execute his or her executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs this means that the monarchs and the viceroys roles are primarily symbolic and cultural acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate in practice ministers direct the use of the royal prerogative that resides in the monarch which includes the privilege to declare war maintain peace and direct the actions of the australian defence force the governorgeneral is empowered by the constitution to summon and prorogue parliament and call elections however the powers are almost never exercised without advice from the prime minister still the royal prerogative belongs to the crown and not to any of the ministers and the governorgeneral may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations such as when during the  australian constitutional crisis sir john kerr dismissed prime minister gough whitlam on the occasion of a stalemate over government funding between the house of representatives and the senate there are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by the queen these include signing the appointment papers of governorsgeneral the confirmation of the creation of awards of australian honours and the approval of any change in her australian title in accordance with convention the governorgeneral to maintain the stability of government must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the house of representatives usually the leader of the political party with a majority in that house but also when no party or coalition holds a majority referred to as a minority government situation or other scenarios in which the governorgenerals judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play the governorgeneral also appoints to cabinet the other ministers of the crown who are in turn accountable to the parliament and through it to the people the queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearingin of a new prime minister and other members of the ministry and she holds audience with her australian ministers where possible members of various executive agencies and other officials are appointed by the governorgeneral including high court judges ministers and parliamentary secretaries are also appointed to the federal executive council public inquiries are also commissioned by the crown through a royal warrant and are called royal commissions a casual vacancy in the senate is filled by an appointee from the same political party by a state parliament or state governorcitation needed foreign affairsedit the royal prerogative also extends to foreign affairs the governorgeneralincouncil negotiates and ratifies treaties alliances and international agreements as with other uses of the royal prerogative no parliamentary approval is required however a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of australia an act of parliament is necessary in such cases the governorgeneral on behalf of the queen also accredits australian high commissioners and ambassadors and receives diplomats from foreign states in addition the issuance of passports falls under the royal prerogative and as such all australian passports are issued in the name of the governorgeneral as the monarchs representativecitation needed parliamentedit the sovereign along with the senate and the house of representatives being one of the three components of parliament is called the queeninparliament the authority of the crown therein is embodied in the mace house of representatives and black rod senate which both bear a crown at their apex the monarch and viceroy do not however participate in the legislative process save for the granting of royal assent by the governorgeneral further the constitution outlines that the governorgeneral alone is responsible for summoning proroguing and dissolving parliament after which the writs for a general election are usually dropped by the prime minister at government house the new parliamentary session is marked by the state opening of parliament during which either the monarch or the governorgeneral reads the speech from the throne as the monarch and viceroy by convention cannot enter the house of representatives this as well as the bestowing of royal assent takes place in the senate chamber members of parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the house of representatives by the crowns messenger the usher of the black rod after he knocks on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the house of representatives all laws in australia except in the australian capital territory act legislative assembly are enacted only with the viceroys granting of royal assent done by the governorgeneral or relevant governor with the great seal of australia or the appropriate state seal while territorial legislatures unlike their state counterparts are subject to the oversight of the government of australia the governorgeneral may reserve a bill for the queens pleasure that is withhold his consent to the bill and present it to the sovereign for her personal decision under the constitution the sovereign also has the power to disallow a bill within one year of the governorgeneral having granted royal assent this power however has never been used courtsedit in the united kingdom the sovereign is deemed the fount of justice however he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases meaning that judicial functions are normally performed only in the monarchs name criminal offences are legally deemed to be offences against the sovereign and proceedings for indictable offences are brought in the sovereigns name in the form of the queen or king against name sometimes also referred to as the crown against name hence the common law holds that the sovereign can do no wrong the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences civil lawsuits against the crown in its public capacity that is lawsuits against the government are permitted however lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognisable in international cases as a sovereign and under established principles of international law the queen of australia is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent the prerogative of mercy lies with the monarch and is exercised in the state jurisdictions by the governors who may pardon offences against the crown either before during or after a trial in addition the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice and of their judicial authority sessions of the high court for example are opened with the words the high court of australia is now in session god save the queen in a practice dating back to colonial times state courts traditionally display the arms of the sovereign in right of the

marshal of the australian army historyedit main article history of monarchy in australia the development of a distinctly australian monarchy came about through a complex set of incremental events beginning in  when captain james cook in the name of and under instruction from king george iii claimed the east coast of australia colonies were eventually founded across the continent all of them ruled by the monarch of the united kingdom upon the advice of his or her british ministers the secretary of state for the colonies in particular after queen victorias granting of royal assent to the commonwealth of australia constitution act on  july  which brought about federation in  whereupon the six colonies became the states of australia the relationship between the state governments and the crown remained as it was pre references in the constitution to the queen meant the government of the united kingdom in the formation of which australians had no say and the colonial laws validity act  – by which colonial laws deemed repugnant to imperial british law in force in the colony were rendered void and inoperative – remained in force in both the federal and state spheres and all the governors both of the commonwealth and the states remained appointees of the british monarch on the advice of the british cabinet a situation that continued even after australia was recognised as a dominion of the british empire in  as queenempress victoria symbolised the british empire of which all australians were subjects a statue of king george v looks over kings hall in old parliament house canberra in response to calls from some dominions for a reevaluation in their status under the crown after their sacrifice and performance in the first world war a series of imperial conferences was held in london from  on which resulted in the balfour declaration of  which provided that the united kingdom and the dominions were to be considered as autonomous communities within the british empire equal in status in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs though united by a common allegiance to the crown the royal and parliamentary titles act  an act of the westminster parliament was the first indication of a shift in the law before the imperial conference of  established that the australian cabinet could advise the sovereign directly on the choice of governorgeneral which ensured the independence of the office the crown was further separated amongst its dominions by the statute of westminster  and though it was not adopted by australia until  retroactive to  september  the laws validity in the united kingdom required its government to seek australias consent in allowing the abdication of edward viii as the king of australia and all the other dominions in  the curtin labor government appointed prince henry duke of gloucester as governorgeneral during the second world war curtin hoped the appointment might influence the british to despatch men and equipment to the pacific war and the selection of the brother of king george vi reaffirmed the important role of the crown to the australian nation at that time the queen became the first reigning monarch to visit australia in  greeted by huge crowds across the nation her son prince charles attended school in australia in  her grandson prince harry undertook a portion of his gapyear living and working in australia in  the sovereign did not possess a title unique to australia until the australian parliament enacted the royal styles and titles act in  after the accession of elizabeth to the throne and giving her the title of queen of the united kingdom australia and her other realms and territories still elizabeth remained both as a queen who reigned in australia both as queen of australia in the federal jurisdiction and queen of the united kingdom in each of the states as a result of the states not wishing to have the statute of westminster apply to them believing that the status quo better protected their sovereign interests against an expansionist federal government which left the colonial laws validity act in effect thus the british monarch could still – at least in theory if not with some difficulty in practice – legislate for the australian states and the viceroys in the states were appointed by and represented the sovereign of the united kingdom not that of australia as late as  the british ministry advised the queen to reject colin hannah as the nominee of the queensland cabinet for governor and court cases from australian states could be appealled directly to the judicial committee of the privy council in london thereby bypassing the australian high court it was with the passage of the australia act in  which repealed the colonial laws validity act and abolished appeals of state cases to london that the final vestiges of the british monarchy in australia were removed leaving a distinct australian monarchy for the nation the view in the republic advisory committees report in  was that if in  victoria as queenempress symbolised the british empire of which all australians were subjects all of the powers vested in the monarch under australias constitution were now exercised on the advice of the australian government in practice the queens representative in australia the governorgeneral represented the british government directly in  and until  when the first high commissioner of the united kingdom to australia was appointed prince charles prince of wales with students of his australian alma mater geelong grammar school in corio victoria it was around the same timeclarification needed that a discussion on the matter of australia becoming a republic began to emerge later culminating in the  australian republic referendum which was defeated by  of the populace despite polls showing that the majority supported becoming a republic it is believed the proposed model of the republic not having a directly elected president was unsatisfactory to most australians the referendum followed the recommendation of a  constitutional convention called to discuss the issue of australia becoming a republic still nearly another ten years later kevin rudd was appointed as prime minister whereafter he affirmed that a republic was still a part of his partys platform and stated his belief that the debate on constitutional change should continue the previous prime minister julia gillard reaffirmed her partys platform about a possible future republic she stated that she would like to see australia become a republic with an appropriate time being when there is a change in monarch a statement unaligned to this position was recorded on  october  at a reception in the presence of the queen at parliament house in canberra when gillard stated that the monarch is a vital constitutional part of australian democracy and would only ever be welcomed as a beloved and respected friend the then opposition leader tony abbott a former head of australians for constitutional monarchy stated on  october  your majesty while  prime ministers and no less than  opposition leaders have come and gone for  years you have been a presence in our national story and given the vagaries of public life im confident that this will not be the final tally of the politicians that you have outlasted a morgan poll taken in october  found that support for constitutional change was at its lowest for  years of those surveyed  were prorepublic as opposed to  promonarchist preferring to maintain the current constitutional

benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization key factors examined by pestel analysis political – what opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business economic – what economic policies trends and structures are expected to affect the organization what is this influence’s degree sociological – what cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations technological – what impact do the technological aspects innovations incentives

ispm university of bern switzerlandcorrespondence to d moher dmoherohricaaccepted  february abstractoverwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials rcts is not optimal without transparent reporting readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects such systematic error is seriously damaging to rcts which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid biasa group of scientists and editors developed the consort consolidated standards of reporting trials statement to improve the quality of reporting of rcts it was first published in  and updated in  the statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an rct many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the consort statement the statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of rctsduring the  consort revision it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the consort statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports a consort explanation and elaboration article was published in  alongside the  version of the consort statementafter an expert meeting in january  the consort statement has been further revised and is published as the consort  statement this update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition such as selective outcome reporting biasthis explanatory and elaboration document—intended to enhance the use understanding and dissemination of the consort statement—has also been extensively revised it presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and where possible references to relevant empirical studies several examples of flow diagrams are includedthe consort  statement this revised explanatory and elaboration document and the associated website wwwconsortstatementorg should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomised trials“the whole of medicine depends on the transparent reporting of clinical trials”well designed and properly executed randomised controlled trials rcts provide the most reliable evidence on the efficacy of healthcare interventions but trials with inadequate methods are associated with bias especially exaggerated treatment effects    biased results from poorly designed and reported trials can mislead decision making in health care at all levels from treatment decisions for a patient to formulation of national public health policiescritical appraisal of the quality of clinical trials is possible only if the design conduct and analysis of rcts are thoroughly and accurately described in the report far from being transparent the reporting of rcts is often incomplete    compounding problems arising from poor methodology     incomplete and inaccurate reportingmany reviews have documented deficiencies in reports of clinical trials for example information on the method used in a trial to assign participants to comparison groups was reported in only  of  trial reports indexed in pubmed in  and only  of  reports indexed in  similarly only  of trial reports indexed in pubmed in  and  in  defined a primary end point and only  in  and  in  reported a sample size calculation reporting is not only often incomplete but also sometimes inaccurate of  reports stating that all participants were included in the analysis in the groups to which they were originally assigned intentiontotreat analysis   excluded patients or did not analyse all patients as allocated many other reviews have found that inadequate reporting is common in specialty journals  and journals published in languages other than english proper randomisation reduces selection bias at trial entry and is the crucial component of high quality rcts successful randomisation hinges on two steps generation of an unpredictable allocation sequence and concealment of this sequence from the investigators enrolling participants see box  box  treatment allocation what’s so special about randomisationthe method used to assign interventions to trial participants is a crucial aspect of clinical trial design random assignment is the preferred method it has been successfully used regularly in trials for more than  years randomisation has three major advantages first when properly implemented it eliminates selection bias balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors in the assignment of treatments without randomisation treatment comparisons may be prejudiced whether consciously or not by selection of participants of a particular kind to receive a particular treatment second random assignment permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between intervention groups merely reflects chance third random allocation in some situations facilitates blinding the identity of treatments to the investigators participants and evaluators possibly by use of a placebo which reduces bias after assignment of treatments of these three advantages reducing selection bias at trial entry is usually the most importantsuccessful randomisation in practice depends on two interrelated aspects—adequate generation of an unpredictable allocation sequence and concealment of that sequence until assignment occurs  a key issue is whether the schedule is known or predictable by the people involved in allocating participants to the comparison groups the treatment allocation system should thus be set up so that the person enrolling participants does not know in advance which treatment the next person will get a process termed allocation concealment  proper allocation concealment shields knowledge of forthcoming assignments whereas proper random sequences prevent correct anticipation of future assignments based on knowledge of past assignmentsunfortunately despite that central role reporting of the methods used for allocation of participants to interventions is also generally inadequate for example  of  reports of supposed rcts in obstetrics and gynaecology journals described studies that were not truly randomised this estimate is conservative as most reports do not at present provide adequate information about the method of allocation     improving the reporting of rcts the consort statementdersimonian and colleagues suggested that “editors could greatly improve the reporting of clinical trials by providing authors with a list of items that they expected to be strictly reported” early in the s two groups of journal editors trialists and methodologists independently published recommendations on the reporting of trials  in a subsequent editorial rennie urged the two groups to meet and develop a common set of recommendations  the outcome was the consort statement consolidated standards of reporting trialsthe consort statement or simply consort comprises a checklist of essential items that should be included in reports of rcts and a diagram for documenting the flow of participants through a trial it is aimed at primary reports of rcts with two group parallel designs most of consort is also relevant to a wider class of trial designs such as noninferiority equivalence factorial cluster and crossover trials extensions to the consort checklist for reporting trials with some of these designs have been published   as have those for reporting certain types of data harms  types of interventions nonpharmacological treatments  herbal interventions and abstractsthe objective of consort is to provide guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of their trials trial reports need be clear complete and transparent readers peer reviewers and editors can also use consort to help them critically appraise and interpret reports of rcts however consort was not meant to be used as a quality assessment instrument rather the content of consort focuses on items related to the internal and external validity of trials many items not explicitly mentioned in consort should also be included in a report such as information about approval by an ethics committee obtaining informed consent from participants and where relevant existence of a data safety and monitoring committee in addition any other aspects of a trial that are mentioned should be properly reported such as information pertinent to cost effectiveness analysis  since its publication in  consort has been supported by more than  journals wwwconsortstatementorg and several editorial groups such as the international committee of medical journal editors the introduction of consort within journals is associated with improved quality of reports of rcts   however consort is an ongoing initiative and the consort statement is revised periodically consort was last revised nine years ago in    since then the evidence base to inform consort has grown considerably empirical data have highlighted new concerns regarding the reporting of rcts such as selective outcome reporting   a consort group meeting was therefore convened in january  in canada to revise the  consort statement and its accompanying explanation and elaboration document the revised checklist is shown in table ⇓ and the flow diagram not revised in fig ⇓  table   consort  checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trialview this tableview popupview inlinefig

download powerpoint the consort  statement explanation and elaborationduring the  consort revision it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the consort statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports the consort explanation and elaboration article was published in  alongside the  version of the consort statement it discussed the rationale and scientific background for each item and provided published examples of good reporting the rationale for revising that article is similar to that for revising the statement described above we briefly describe below the main additions and deletions to this version of the explanation and elaboration articlethe consort  explanation and elaboration changeswe have made several substantive and some cosmetic changes to this version of the consort explanatory document full details are highlighted in the  version of the consort statement some reflect changes to the consort checklist there are three new checklist items in the consort  checklist—such as item  which asks authors to report where their trial protocol can be accessed we have also updated some existing explanations including adding more recent references to methodological evidence and used some better examples we have removed the glossary which is now available on the consort website wwwconsortstatementorg where possible we describe the findings of relevant empirical studies many excellent books on clinical trials offer fuller discussion of methodological issues   finally for convenience we sometimes refer to “treatments” and “patients” although we recognise that not all interventions evaluated in rcts are treatments and not all participants are patientschecklist itemstitle and abstractitem a identification as a randomised trial in the titleexample—“smoking reduction with oral nicotine inhalers double blind randomised clinical trial of efficacy and safety”explanation—the ability to identify a report of a randomised trial in an electronic database depends to a large extent on how it was indexed indexers may not classify a report as a randomised trial if the authors do not explicitly report this information to help ensure that a study is appropriately indexed and easily identified authors should use the word “randomised” in the title to indicate that the participants were randomly assigned to their comparison groupsitem b structured summary of trial design methods results and conclusionsfor specific guidance see consort for abstracts explanation—clear transparent and sufficiently detailed abstracts are important because readers often base their assessment of a trial on such information some readers use an abstract as a screening tool to decide whether to read the full article however as not all trials are freely available and some health professionals do not have access to the full trial reports healthcare decisions are sometimes made on the basis of abstracts of randomised trialsa journal abstract should contain sufficient information about a trial to serve as an accurate record of its conduct and findings providing optimal information about the trial within the space constraints and format of a journal a properly constructed and written abstract helps individuals to assess quickly the relevance of the findings and aids the retrieval of relevant reports from electronic databases the abstract should accurately reflect what is included in the full journal article and should not include information that does not appear in the body of the paper studies comparing the accuracy of information reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with or missing from the body of the full article    conversely omitting important harms from the abstract could seriously mislead someone’s interpretation of the trial findings a recent extension to the consort statement provides a list of essential items that authors should include when reporting the main results of a randomised trial in a journal or conference abstract see table ⇓ we strongly recommend the use of structured abstracts for reporting randomised trials they provide readers with information about the trial under a series of headings pertaining to the design conduct analysis and interpretation some studies have found that structured abstracts are of higher quality than the more traditional descriptive abstracts  and that they allow readers to find information more easily we recognise that many journals have developed their own structure and word limit for reporting abstracts it is not our intention to suggest changes to these formats but to recommend what information should be reportedtable   items to include when reporting a randomised trial in a journal abstract view this tableview popupview inlineintroductionitem a scientific background and explanation of rationaleexample—“surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with disease stage i and ii nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc … an nsclc metaanalysis combined the results from eight randomised trials of surgery versus surgery plus adjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy and showed a small but not significant p absolute survival benefit of around  at  years from  to  at the time the current trial was designed mids adjuvant chemotherapy had not become standard clinical practice … the clinical rationale for neoadjuvant chemotherapy is threefold regression of the primary cancer could be achieved thereby facilitating and simplifying or reducing subsequent surgery undetected micrometastases could be dealt with at the start of treatment and there might be inhibition of the putative stimulus to residual cancer by growth factors released by surgery and by subsequent wound healing … the current trial was therefore set up to compare in patients with resectable nsclc surgery alone versus three cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy followed by surgery in terms of overall survival quality of life pathological staging resectability rates extent of surgery and time to and site of relapse”explanation—typically the introduction consists of free flowing text in which authors explain the scientific background and rationale for their trial and its general outline it may also be appropriate to include here the objectives of the trial see item bthe rationale may be explanatory for example to assess the possible influence of a drug on renal function or pragmatic for example to guide practice by comparing the benefits and harms of two treatments authors should report any evidence of the benefits and harms of active interventions included in a trial and should suggest a plausible explanation for how the interventions might work if this is not obviousthe declaration of helsinki states that biomedical research involving people should be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature that is it is unethical to expose humans unnecessarily to the risks of research some clinical trials have been shown to have been unnecessary because the question they addressed had been or could have been answered by a systematic review of the existing literature  thus the need for a new trial should be justified in the introduction ideally it should include a reference to a systematic review of previous similar trials or a note of the absence of such trialsitem b specific objectives or hypothesesexample—“in the current study we tested the hypothesis that a policy of active management of nulliparous labour would  reduce the rate of caesarean section  reduce the rate of prolonged labour  not influence maternal satisfaction with the birth experience”explanation—objectives are the questions that the trial was designed to answer they often relate to the efficacy of a particular therapeutic or preventive intervention hypotheses are prespecified questions being tested to help meet the objectives hypotheses are more specific than objectives and are amenable to explicit statistical evaluation in practice objectives and hypotheses are not always easily differentiated most reports of rcts provide adequate information about trial objectives and hypothesesmethodsitem a description of trial design such as parallel factorial including allocation ratioexample—“this was a multicenter stratified  to  years and  to  years of age with imbalanced randomisation  doubleblind placebocontrolled parallelgroup study conducted in the united states  sites”explanation—the word “design” is often used to refer to all aspects of how a trial is set up but it also has a narrower interpretation many specific aspects of the broader trial design including details of randomisation and blinding are addressed elsewhere in the consort checklist here we seek information on the type of trial such as parallel group or factorial and the conceptual framework such as superiority or noninferiority and other related issues not addressed elsewhere in the checklistthe consort statement focuses mainly on trials with participants individually randomised to one of two “parallel” groups in fact little more than half of published trials have such a design the main alternative designs are multiarm parallel crossover cluster and factorial designs also most trials are set to identify the superiority of a new intervention if it exists but others are designed to assess noninferiority or equivalence it is important that researchers clearly describe these aspects of their trial including the unit of randomisation such as patient gp practice lesion it is desirable also to include these details in the abstract see item bif a less common design is employed authors are encouraged to explain their choice especially as such designs may imply the need for a larger sample size or more complex analysis and interpretationalthough most trials use equal randomisation such as  for two groups it is helpful to provide the allocation ratio explicitly for drug trials specifying the phase of the trial iiv may also be relevantitem b important changes to methods after trial commencement such as eligibility criteria with reasonsexample—“patients were randomly assigned to one of six parallel groups initially in  ratio to receive either one of five otamixaban … regimens … or an active control of unfractionated heparin … an independent data monitoring committee reviewed unblinded data for patient safety no interim analyses for efficacy or futility were done during the trial this committee recommended that the group receiving the lowest dose of otamixaban · mgkgh be discontinued because of clinical evidence of inadequate anticoagulation the protocol was immediately amended in accordance with that recommendation and participants were subsequently randomly assigned in  ratio to the remaining otamixaban and control groups respectively”explanation—a few trials may start without any fixed plan that is are entirely exploratory but the most will have a protocol that specifies in great detail how the trial will be conducted there may be deviations from the original protocol as it is impossible to predict every possible change in circumstances during the course of a trial some trials will therefore have important changes to the methods after trial commencementchanges could be due to external information becoming available from other studies or internal financial difficulties or could be due to a disappointing recruitment rate such protocol changes should be made without breaking the blinding on the accumulating data on participants’ outcomes in some trials an independent data monitoring committee will have as part of its remit the possibility of recommending protocol changes based on seeing unblinded data such changes might affect the study methods such as changes to treatment regimens eligibility criteria randomisation ratio or duration of followup or trial conduct such as dropping a centre with poor data qualitysome trials are set up with a formal “adaptive” design there is no universally accepted definition of these designs but a working definition might be “a multistage study design that uses accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the study without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial” the modifications are usually to the sample sizes and the number of treatment arms and can lead to decisions being made more quickly and with more efficient use of resources there are however important ethical statistical and practical issues in considering such a design whether the modifications are explicitly part of the trial design or in response to changing circumstances it is essential that they are fully reported to help the reader interpret the results changes from protocols are not currently well reported a review of comparisons with protocols showed that about half of journal articles describing rcts had an unexplained discrepancy in the primary outcomes frequent unexplained discrepancies have also been observed for details of randomisation blinding and statistical analysesitem a eligibility criteria for participantsexample—“eligible participants were all adults aged  or over with hiv who met the eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy according to the malawian national hiv treatment guidelines who clinical stage iii or iv or any who stage with a cd count mm and who were starting treatment with a bmi  exclusion criteria were pregnancy and lactation or participation in another supplementary feeding programme”explanation—a comprehensive description of the eligibility criteria used to select the trial participants is needed to help readers interpret the study in particular a clear understanding of these criteria is one of several elements required to judge to whom the results of a trial apply—that is the trial’s generalisability applicability and relevance to clinical or public health practice see item  a description of the method of recruitment such as by referral or self selection for example through advertisements is also important in this context because they are applied before randomisation eligibility criteria do not affect the internal validity of a trial but they are central to its external validitytypical and widely accepted selection criteria relate to the nature and stage of the disease being studied the exclusion of persons thought to be particularly vulnerable to harm from the study intervention and to issues required to ensure that the study satisfies legal and ethical norms informed consent by study participants for example is typically required in intervention studies the common distinction between inclusion and exclusion criteria is unnecessary the same criterion can be phrased to include or exclude participantsdespite their importance eligibility criteria are often not reported adequately for example eight published trials leading to clinical alerts by the national institutes of health specified an average of  eligibility criteria in their protocols but only  of the criteria were mentioned in the journal articles and only  were mentioned in the clinical alerts similar deficiencies were found for hiv clinical trials among  reports of rcts in surgery  did not specify any eligibility criteriaitem b settings and locations where the data were collectedexample—“the study took place at the antiretroviral therapy clinic of queen elizabeth central hospital in blantyre malawi from january  to april  blantyre is the major commercial city of malawi with a population of    and an estimated hiv prevalence of  in adults in ”explanation—along with the eligibility criteria for participants see item a and the description of the interventions see item  information on the settings and locations is crucial to judge the applicability and generalisability of a trial were participants recruited from primary secondary or tertiary health care or from the community healthcare institutions vary greatly in their organisation experience and resources and the baseline risk for the condition under investigation other aspects of the setting including the social economic and cultural environment and the climate may also affect a study’s external validityauthors should report the number and type of settings and describe the care providers involved they should report the locations in which the study was carried out including the country city if applicable and immediate environment for example community office practice hospital clinic or inpatient unit in particular it should be clear whether the trial was carried out in one or several centres “multicentre trials” this description should provide enough information so that readers can judge whether the results of the trial could be relevant to their own setting the environment in which the trial is conducted may differ considerably from the setting in which the trial’s results are later used to guide practice and policy  authors should also report any other information about the settings and locations that could have influenced the observed results such as problems with transportation that might have affected patient participation or delays in administering interventionsitem  the interventions for each group with sufficient details to allow replication including how and when they were actually administeredexamples—“in poise patients received the first dose of the study drug ie oral extendedrelease metoprolol  mg or matching placebo  h before surgery study drug administration required a heart rate of  bpm or more and a systolic blood pressure of  mm hg or greater these haemodynamics were checked before each administration if at any time during the first  h after surgery heart rate was  bpm or more and systolic blood pressure was  mm hg or higher patients received their first postoperative dose extendedrelease metoprolol  mg or matched placebo orally if the study drug was not given during the first  h patients received their first postoperative dose at  h after surgery  h after the first postoperative dose patients started taking oral extendedrelease metoprolol  mg or placebo every day for  days if a patient’s heart rate was consistently below  bpm or their systolic blood pressure dropped below  mm hg study drug was withheld until their heart rate or systolic blood pressure recovered the study drug was then restarted at  mg once daily patients whose heart rate was consistently  bpm and systolic blood pressure exceeded  mm hg delayed taking the study drug for  h”“patients were randomly assigned to receive a custommade neoprene splint to be worn at night or to usual care the splint was a rigid rest orthosis recommended for use only at night it covered the base of the thumb and the thenar eminence but not the wrist figure  splints were made by  trained occupational therapists who adjusted the splint for each patient so that the first web could be opened and the thumb placed in opposition with the first long finger patients were encouraged to contact the occupational therapist if they felt that the splint needed adjustment pain increased while wearing the splint or they had adverse effects such as skin erosion because no treatment can be considered the gold standard in this situation patients in the control and intervention groups received usual care at the discretion of their physician general practitioner or rheumatologist we decided not to use a placebo because to our knowledge no placebo for splinting has achieved successful blinding of patients as recommended”explanation—authors should describe each intervention thoroughly including control interventions the description should allow a clinician wanting to use the intervention to know exactly how to administer the intervention that was evaluated in the trial for a drug intervention information would include the drug name dose method of administration such as oral intravenous timing and duration of administration conditions under which interventions are withheld and titration regimen if applicable if the control group is to receive “usual care” it is important to describe thoroughly what that constitutes if the control group or intervention group is to receive a combination of interventions the authors should provide a thorough description of each intervention an explanation of the order in which the combination of interventions are introduced or withdrawn and the triggers for their introduction if applicablespecific extensions of the consort statement address the reporting of nonpharmacologic and herbal interventions and their particular reporting requirements such as expertise details of how the interventions were standardised  we recommend readers consult the statements for nonpharmacologic and herbal interventions as appropriateitem a completely defined prespecified primary and secondary outcome measures including how and when they were assessedexample—“the primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in psoriasis was the proportion of patients achieving a  improvement in psoriasis activity from baseline to  weeks as measured by the pasi psoriasis area and severity index additional analyses were done on the percentage change in pasi scores and improvement in target psoriasis lesions”explanation—all rcts assess response variables or outcomes end points for which the groups are compared most trials have several outcomes some of which are of more interest than others the primary outcome measure is the prespecified outcome considered to be of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders such a patients policy makers clinicians funders and is usually the one used in the sample size calculation see item  some trials may have more than one primary outcome having several primary outcomes however incurs the problems of interpretation associated with multiplicity of analyses see items  and  and is not recommended primary outcomes should be explicitly indicated as such in the report of an rct other outcomes of interest are secondary outcomes additional outcomes there may be several secondary outcomes which often include unanticipated or unintended effects of the intervention see item  although harms should always be viewed as important whether they are labelled primary or secondaryall outcome measures whether primary or secondary should be identified and completely defined the principle here is that the information provided should be sufficient to allow others to use the same outcomes when outcomes are assessed at several time points after randomisation authors should also indicate the prespecified time point of primary interest for many nonpharmacological interventions it is helpful to specify who assessed outcomes for example if special skills are required to do so and how many assessors there werewhere available and appropriate the use of previously developed and validated scales or consensus guidelines should be reported  both to enhance quality of measurement and to assist in comparison with similar studies for example assessment of quality of life is likely to be improved by using a validated instrument authors should indicate the provenance and properties of scalesmore than  outcomes were used in  rcts of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and  different instruments had been used in  trials in schizophrenia of which  had been used only once investigation of  of those  trials showed that unpublished scales were a source of bias in nonpharmacological trials a third of the claims of treatment superiority based on unpublished scales would not have been made if a published scale had been used similar data have been reported elsewhere  only  of a cohort of  rcts published in  specified the primary outcome this compares with  for a similar cohort of  rcts published in item b any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced with reasonsexample—“the original primary endpoint was allcause mortality but during a masked analysis the data and safety monitoring board noted that overall mortality was lower than had been predicted and that the study could not be completed with the sample size and power originally planned the steering committee therefore decided to adopt coprimary endpoints of allcause mortality the original primary endpoint together with allcause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admissions the first prespecified secondary endpoint”explanation—there are many reasons for departures from the initial study protocol see item  authors should report all major changes to the protocol including unplanned changes to eligibility criteria interventions examinations data collection methods of analysis and outcomes such information is not always reportedas indicated earlier see item a most trials record multiple outcomes with the risk that results will be reported for only a selected subset see item  prespecification and reporting of primary and secondary outcomes see item a should remove such a risk in some trials however circumstances require a change in the way an outcome is assessed or even as in the example above a switch to a different outcome for example there may be external evidence from other trials or systematic reviews suggesting the end point might not be appropriate or recruitment or the overall event rate in the trial may be lower than expected changing an end point based on unblinded data is much more problematic although it may be specified in the context of an adaptive trial design authors should identify and explain any such changes likewise any changes after the trial began of the designation of outcomes as primary or secondary should be reported and explaineda comparison of protocols and publications of  randomised trials found that  of trials reports had at least one primary outcome that was changed introduced or omitted compared with the protocol primary outcomes also differed between protocols and publications for  of a cohort of  trials funded by the canadian institutes of health research not one of the subsequent  trial reports mentioned let alone explained changes from the protocol similar results from other studies have been reported recently in a systematic review of empirical studies examining outcome reporting biasitem a how sample size was determinedexamples—“to detect a reduction in phs postoperative hospital stay of  days sd  days which is in agreement with the study of lobo et al with a twosided  significance level and a power of  a sample size of  patients per group was necessary given an anticipated dropout rate of  to recruit this number of patients a month inclusion period was anticipated”“based on an expected incidence of the primary composite endpoint of  at  years in the placebo group we calculated that we would need  primary endpoint events and a sample size of  patients to give  power to detect a significant difference between ivabradine and placebo corresponding to a  reduction of relative risk with a twosided type  error of  we initially designed an eventdriven trial and planned to stop when  primary endpoint events had occurred however the incidence of the primary endpoint was higher than predicted perhaps because of baseline characteristics of the recruited patients who had higher risk than expected eg lower proportion of nyha class i and higher rates of diabetes and hypertension we calculated that when  primary endpoint events had occurred the most recently included patients would only have been treated for about  months therefore in january  the executive committee decided to change the study from being eventdriven to timedriven and to continue the study until the patients who were randomised last had been followed up for  months this change did not alter the planned study duration of  years”explanation—for scientific and ethical reasons the sample size for a trial needs to be planned carefully with a balance between medical and statistical considerations ideally a study should be large enough to have a high probability power of detecting as statistically significant a clinically important difference of a given size if such a difference exists the size of effect deemed important is inversely related to the sample size necessary to detect it that is large samples are necessary to detect small differences elements of the sample size calculation are  the estimated outcomes in each group which implies the clinically important target difference between the intervention groups  the α type i error level  the statistical power or the β type ii error level and  for continuous outcomes the standard deviation of the measurements the interplay of these elements and their reporting will differ for cluster trials and noninferiority and equivalence trialsauthors should indicate how the sample size was determined if a formal power calculation was used the authors should identify the primary outcome on which the calculation was based see item a all the quantities used in the calculation and the resulting target sample size per study group it is preferable to quote the expected result in the control group and the difference between the groups one would not like to overlook alternatively authors could present the percentage with the event or mean for each group used in their calculations details should be given of any allowance made for attrition or noncompliance during the studysome methodologists have written that so called underpowered trials may be acceptable because they could ultimately be combined in a systematic review and metaanalysis   and because some information is better than no information of note important caveats apply—such as the trial should be unbiased reported properly and published irrespective of the results thereby becoming available for metaanalysis on the other hand many medical researchers worry that underpowered trials with indeterminate results will remain unpublished and insist that all trials should individually have “sufficient power” this debate will continue and members of the consort group have varying views critically however the debate and those views are immaterial to reporting a trial whatever the power of a trial authors need to properly report their intended size with all their methods and assumptions that transparently reveals the power of the trial to readers and gives them a measure by which to assess whether the trial attained its planned sizein some trials interim analyses are used to help decide whether to stop early or to continue recruiting sometimes beyond the planned trial end see item b if the actual sample size differed from the originally intended sample size for some other reason for example because of poor recruitment or revision of the target sample size the explanation should be givenreports of studies with small samples frequently include the erroneous conclusion that the intervention groups do not differ when in fact too few patients were studied to make such a claim reviews of published trials have consistently found that a high proportion of trials have low power to detect clinically meaningful treatment effects   in reality small but clinically meaningful true differences are much more likely than large differences to exist but large trials are required to detect themin general the reported sample sizes in trials seem small the median sample size was  patients in  trials in arthritis  patients in  trials in dermatology and  patients in  trials in schizophrenia these small sample sizes are consistent with those of a study of  trials indexed in pubmed in december  and a similar cohort of trials n indexed in pubmed in  where the median number of patients recruited for parallel group trials was  across both years moreover many reviews have found that few authors report how they determined the sample size    there is little merit in a post hoc calculation of statistical power using the results of a trial the power is then appropriately indicated by confidence intervals see item item b when applicable explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelinesexamples—“two interim analyses were performed during the trial the levels of significance maintained an overall p value of  and were calculated according to the o’brienfleming stopping boundaries this final analysis used a z score of  with an associated p value of ”“an independent data and safety monitoring board periodically reviewed the efficacy and safety data stopping rules were based on modified haybittlepeto boundaries of  sd in the first half of the study and  sd in the second half for efficacy data and  sd in the first half of the study and  sd in the second half for safety data two formal interim analyses of efficacy were performed when  and  of the expected number of primary events had accrued no correction of the reported p value for these interim tests was performed”explanation—many trials recruit participants over a long period if an intervention is working particularly well or badly the study may need to be ended early for ethical reasons this concern can be addressed by examining results as the data accumulate preferably by an independent data monitoring committee however performing multiple statistical examinations of accumulating data without appropriate correction can lead to erroneous results and interpretations if the accumulating data from a trial are examined at five interim analyses that use a p value of  the overall false positive rate is nearer to  than to the nominal several group sequential statistical methods are available to adjust for multiple analyses   and their use should be prespecified in the trial protocol with these methods data are compared at each interim analysis and a p value less than the critical value specified by the group sequential method indicates statistical significance some trialists use group sequential methods as an aid to decision making whereas others treat them as a formal stopping rule with the intention that the trial will cease if the observed p value is smaller than the critical valueauthors should report whether they or a data monitoring committee took multiple “looks” at the data and if so how many there were what triggered them the statistical methods used including any formal stopping rule and whether they were planned before the start of the trial before the data monitoring committee saw any interim data by allocation or some time thereafter this information is often not included in published trial reports even in trials that report stopping earlier than planneditem a method used to generate the random allocation sequenceexamples—“independent pharmacists dispensed either active or placebo inhalers according to a computer generated randomisation list”“for allocation of the participants a computergenerated list of random numbers was used”explanation—participants should be assigned to comparison groups in the trial on the basis of a chance random process characterised by unpredictability see box  authors should provide sufficient information that the reader can assess the methods used to generate the random allocation sequence and the likelihood of bias in group assignment it is important that information on the process of randomisation is included in the body of the main article and not as a separate supplementary file where it can be missed by the readerthe term “random” has a precise technical meaning with random allocation each participant has a known probability of receiving each intervention before one is assigned but the assigned intervention is determined by a chance process and cannot be predicted however “random” is often used inappropriately in the literature to describe trials in which nonrandom deterministic allocation methods were used such as alternation hospital numbers or date of birth when investigators use such nonrandom methods they should describe them precisely and should not use the term “random” or any variation of it even the term “quasirandom” is unacceptable for describing such trials trials based on nonrandom methods generally yield biased results    bias presumably arises from the inability to conceal these allocation systems adequately see item many methods of sequence generation are adequate however readers cannot judge adequacy from such terms as “random allocation” “randomisation” or “random” without further elaboration authors should specify the method of sequence generation such as a randomnumber table or a computerised random number generator the sequence may be generated by the process of minimisation a nonrandom but generally acceptable method see box box  randomisation and minimisationsimple randomisation—pure randomisation based on a single allocation ratio is known as simple randomisation simple randomisation with a  allocation ratio is analogous to a coin toss although we do not advocate coin tossing for randomisation in an rct “simple” is somewhat of a misnomer while other randomisation schemes sound complex and more sophisticated in reality simple randomisation is elegantly sophisticated in that it is more unpredictable and surpasses the bias prevention levels of all other alternativesrestricted randomisation—any randomised approach that is not simple randomisation blocked randomisation is the most common form other means of restricted randomisation include replacement biased coin and urn randomisation although these are used much less frequentlyblocked randomisation—blocking is used to ensure that comparison groups will be generated according to a predetermined ratio usually  or groups of approximately the same size blocking can be used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any time during the trial for every block of eight participants for example four would be allocated to each arm of the trial improved balance comes at the cost of reducing the unpredictability of the sequence although the order of interventions varies randomly within each block a person running the trial could deduce some of the next treatment allocations if he or she knew the block size blinding the interventions using larger block sizes and randomly varying the block size can ameliorate this problemstratified randomisation—stratification is used to ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group by chance particularly in small trials study groups may not be well matched for baseline characteristics such as age and stage of disease this weakens the trial’s credibility such imbalances can be avoided without sacrificing the advantages of randomisation stratification ensures that the numbers of participants receiving each intervention are closely balanced within each stratum stratified randomisation is achieved by performing a separate randomisation procedure within each of two or more subsets of participants for example those defining each study centre age or disease severity stratification by centre is common in multicentre trials stratification requires some form of restriction such as blocking within strata stratification without blocking is ineffectiveminimisation—minimisation ensures balance between intervention groups for several selected patient factors such as age  the first patient is truly randomly allocated for each subsequent participant the treatment allocation that minimises the imbalance on the selected factors between groups at that time is identified that allocation may then be used or a choice may be made at random with a heavy weighting in favour of the intervention that would minimise imbalance for example with a probability of  the use of a random component is generally preferable minimisation has the advantage of making small groups closely similar in terms of participant characteristics at all stages of the trial minimisation offers the only acceptable alternative to randomisation and some have argued that it is superior on the other hand minimisation lacks the theoretical basis for eliminating bias on all known and unknown factors nevertheless in general trials that use minimisation are considered methodologically equivalent to randomised trials even when a random element is not incorporatedin some trials participants are intentionally allocated in unequal numbers to each intervention for example to gain more experience with a new procedure or to limit costs of the trial in such cases authors should report the randomisation ratio for example  or two treatment participants per each control participant see item ain a representative sample of pubmed indexed trials in  only  reported an adequate approach to random sequence generation this increased to  for a similar cohort of pubmed indexed trials in  in more than  of these cases researchers used a random number generator on a computer or a random number tableitem b type of randomisation details of any restriction such as blocking and block sizeexamples—“randomization sequence was created using stata  statacorp college station tx statistical software and was stratified by center with a  allocation using random block sizes of   and ”“participants were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures computerized random numbers to  of  treatment groups”explanation—in trials of several hundred participants or more simple randomisation can usually be trusted to generate similar numbers in the two trial groups and to generate groups that are roughly comparable in terms of known and unknown prognostic variables for smaller trials see item a—and even for trials that are not intended to be small as they may stop before reaching their target size—some restricted randomisation procedures to help achieve balance between groups in size or characteristics may be useful see box it is important to indicate whether no restriction was used by stating such or by stating that “simple randomisation” was done otherwise the methods used to restrict the randomisation along with the method used for random selection should be specified for block randomisation authors should provide details on how the blocks were generated for example by using a permuted block design with a computer random number generator the block size or sizes and whether the block size was fixed or randomly varied if the trialists became aware of the block sizes that information should also be reported as such knowledge could lead to code breaking authors should specify whether stratification was used and if so which factors were involved such as recruitment site sex disease stage the categorisation cutoff values within strata and the method used for restriction although stratification is a useful technique especially for smaller trials it is complicated to implement and may be impossible if many stratifying factors are used if minimisation see box  was used it should be explicitly identified as should the variables incorporated into the scheme if used a random element should be indicatedonly  of  reports of trials in specialty journals and  of  trials in general medical journals reported use of stratification in each case only about half of the reports mentioned the use of restricted randomisation however these studies and that of adetugbo and williams found that the sizes of the treatment groups in many trials were the same or quite similar yet blocking or stratification had not been mentioned one possible explanation for the close balance in numbers is underreporting of the use of restricted randomisationitem  mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence such as sequentially numbered containers describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were assignedexamples—“the doxycycline and placebo were in capsule form and identical in appearance they were prepacked in bottles and consecutively numbered for each woman according to the randomisation schedule each woman was assigned an order number and received the capsules in the corresponding prepacked bottle”“the allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher jr enrolling and assessing participants in sequentially numbered opaque sealed and stapled envelopes aluminium foil inside the envelope was used to render the envelope impermeable to intense light to prevent subversion of the allocation sequence the name and date of birth of the participant was written on the envelope and a video tape made of the sealed envelope with participant details visible carbon paper inside the envelope transferred the information onto the allocation card inside the envelope and a second researcher cc later viewed video tapes to ensure envelopes were still sealed when participants’ names were written on them corresponding envelopes were opened only after the enrolled participants completed all baseline assessments and it was time to allocate the intervention”explanation—item a discussed generation of an unpredictable sequence of assignments of considerable importance is how this sequence is applied when participants are enrolled into the trial see box  a generated allocation schedule should be implemented by using allocation concealment a critical mechanism that prevents foreknowledge of treatment assignment and thus shields those who enroll participants from being influenced by this knowledge the decision to accept or reject a participant should be made and informed consent should be obtained from the participant in ignorance of the next assignment in the sequencethe allocation concealment should not be confused with blinding see item  allocation concealment seeks to prevent selection bias protects the assignment sequence until allocation and can always be successfully implemented in contrast blinding seeks to prevent performance and ascertainment bias protects the sequence after allocation and cannot always be implemented without adequate allocation concealment however even random unpredictable assignment sequences can be subverted centralised or “thirdparty” assignment is especially desirable many good allocation concealment mechanisms incorporate external involvement use of a pharmacy or central telephone randomisation system are two common techniques automated assignment systems are likely to become more common when external involvement is not feasible an excellent method of allocation concealment is the use of numbered containers the interventions often drugs are sealed in sequentially numbered identical containers according to the allocation sequence enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes can be a good allocation concealment mechanism if it is developed and monitored diligently this method can be corrupted however particularly if it is poorly executed investigators should ensure that the envelopes are opaque when held to the light and opened sequentially and only after the participant’s name and other details are written on the appropriate envelopea number of methodological studies provide empirical evidence to support these precautions  trials in which the allocation sequence had been inadequately or unclearly concealed yielded larger estimates of treatment effects than did trials in which authors reported adequate allocation concealment these findings provide strong empirical evidence that inadequate allocation concealment contributes to bias in estimating treatment effectsdespite the importance of the mechanism of allocation concealment published reports often omit such details the mechanism used to allocate interventions was omitted in reports of  of trials in rheumatoid arthritis  of trials in obstetrics and gynaecology journals and  of trials in general medical journals in a more broadly representative sample of all randomised trials indexed on pubmed only  reported any allocation concealment mechanism but some of those reported mechanisms were inadequateitem  who generated the allocation sequence who enrolled participants and who assigned participants to interventionsexamples—“determination of whether a patient would be treated by streptomycin and bedrest s case or by bedrest alone c case was made by reference to a statistical series based on random sampling numbers drawn up for each sex at each centre by professor bradford hill the details of the series were unknown to any of the investigators or to the coordinator … after acceptance of a patient by the panel and before admission to the streptomycin centre the appropriate numbered envelope was opened at the central office the card inside told if the patient was to be an s or a c case and this information was then given to the medical officer of the centre”“details of the allocated group were given on coloured cards contained in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes these were prepared at the npeu and kept in an agreed location on each ward randomisation took place at the end of the nd stage of labour when the midwife considered a vaginal birth was imminent to enter a women into the study the midwife opened the next consecutively numbered envelope”“block randomisation was by a computer generated random number list prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial we stratified by admission for an oncology related procedure after the research nurse had obtained the patient’s consent she telephoned a contact who was independent of the recruitment process for allocation consignment”explanation—as noted in item  concealment of the allocated intervention at the time of enrolment is especially important thus in addition to knowing the methods used it is also important to understand how the random sequence was implemented—specifically who generated the allocation sequence who enrolled participants and who assigned participants to trial groupsthe process of randomising participants into a trial has three different steps sequence generation allocation concealment and implementation see box  although the same people may carry out more than one process under each heading investigators should strive for complete separation of the people involved with generation and allocation concealment from the people involved in the implementation of assignments thus if someone is involved in the sequence generation or allocation concealment steps ideally they should not be involved in the implementation stepbox  steps in a

generation and allocation concealment failure to separate creation and concealment of the allocation sequence from assignment to study group may introduce bias for example the person who generated an allocation sequence could retain a copy and consult it when interviewing potential participants for a trial thus that person could bias the enrolment or assignment process regardless of the unpredictability of the assignment sequence investigators must then ensure that the assignment schedule is unpredictable and locked away such as in a safe deposit box in a building rather inaccessible to the enrolment location from even the person who generated it the report of the trial should specify where the investigators stored the allocation listitem a if done who was blinded after assignment to interventions for example participants care providers those assessing outcomes and howexamples—“whereas patients and physicians allocated to the intervention group were aware of the allocated arm outcome assessors and data analysts were kept blinded to the allocation”“blinding and equipoise were strictly maintained by emphasising to intervention staff and participants that each diet adheres to healthy principles and each is advocated by certain experts to be superior for longterm weightloss except for the interventionists dieticians and behavioural psychologists investigators and staff were kept blind to diet assignment of the participants the trial adhered to established procedures to maintain separation between staff that take outcome measurements and staff that deliver the intervention staff members who obtained outcome measurements were not informed of the diet group assignment intervention staff dieticians and behavioural psychologists who delivered the intervention did not take outcome measurements all investigators staff and participants were kept masked to outcome measurements and trial results”explanation—the term “blinding” or “masking” refers to withholding information about the assigned interventions from people involved in the trial who may potentially be influenced by this knowledge blinding is an important safeguard against bias particularly when assessing subjective outcomesbenjamin franklin has been credited as being the first to use blinding in a scientific experiment he blindfolded participants so they would not know when he was applying mesmerism a popular “healing fluid” of the th century and in so doing showed that mesmerism was a sham based on this experiment the scientific community recognised the power of blinding to reduce bias and it has remained a commonly used strategy in scientific experimentsbox  on blinding terminology defines the groups of individuals that is participants healthcare providers data collectors outcome adjudicators and data analysts who can potentially introduce bias into a trial through knowledge of the treatment assignments participants may respond differently if they are aware of their treatment assignment such as responding more favourably when they receive the new treatment lack of blinding may also influence compliance with the intervention use of cointerventions and risk of dropping out of the trialunblinded healthcare providers may introduce similar biases and unblinded data collectors may differentially assess outcomes such as frequency or timing repeat measurements of abnormal findings or provide encouragement during performance testing unblinded outcome adjudicators may differentially assess subjective outcomes and unblinded data analysts may introduce bias through the choice of analytical strategies such as the selection of favourable time points or outcomes and by decisions to remove patients from the analyses these biases have been well documented     blinding unlike allocation concealment see item  may not always be appropriate or possible an example is a trial comparing levels of pain associated with sampling blood from the ear or thumb blinding is particularly important when outcome measures involve some subjectivity such as assessment of pain blinding of data collectors and outcome adjudicators is unlikely to matter for objective outcomes such as death from any cause even then however lack of participant or healthcare provider blinding can lead to other problems such as differential attrition in certain trials especially surgical trials blinding of participants and surgeons is often difficult or impossible but blinding of data collectors and outcome adjudicators is often achievable for example lesions can be photographed before and after treatment and assessed by an external observer regardless of whether blinding is possible authors can and should always state who was blinded that is participants healthcare providers data collectors and outcome adjudicatorsunfortunately authors often do not report whether blinding was used for example reports of  of  trials in cystic fibrosis  of  trials in rheumatoid arthritis and  of  trials in dermatology did not state whether blinding was used until authors of trials improve their reporting of blinding readers will have difficulty in judging the validity of the trials that they may wish to use to guide their clinical practicethe term masking is sometimes used in preference to blinding to avoid confusion with the medical condition of being without sight however “blinding” in its methodological sense seems to be understood worldwide and is acceptable for reporting clinical trials box  blinding terminologyin order for a technical term to have utility it must have consistency in its use and interpretation authors of trials commonly use the term “double blind” and less commonly the terms “single blind”or “triple blind” a problem with this lexicon is that there is great variability in clinician interpretations and epidemiological textbook definitions of these terms moreover a study of  rcts reported as double blind found  different combinations of groups actually blinded when the authors of these trials were surveyed and about one in every five of these trials—reported as double blind—did not blind participants healthcare providers or data collectorsthis research shows that terms are ambiguous and as such authors and editors should abandon their use authors should instead explicitly report the blinding status of the people involved for whom blinding may influence the validity of a trialhealthcare providers include all personnel for example physicians chiropractors physiotherapists nurses who care for the participants during the trial data collectors are the individuals who collect data on the trial outcomes outcome adjudicators are the individuals who determine whether a participant did experience the outcomes of interestsome researchers have also advocated blinding and reporting the blinding status of the data monitoring committee and the manuscript writers blinding of these groups is uncommon and the value of blinding them is debatedsometimes one group of individuals such as the healthcare providers are the same individuals fulfilling another role in a trial such as data collectors even if this is the case the authors should explicitly state the blinding status of these groups to allow readers to judge the validity of the trialitem b if relevant description of the similarity of interventionsexample—“jamieson laboratories inc provided mg immediate release niacin in a white oblong bisect caplet we independently confirmed caplet content using high performance liquid chromatography … the placebo was matched to the study drug for taste color and size and contained microcrystalline cellulose silicon dioxide dicalcium phosphate magnesium stearate and stearic acid”explanation—just as we seek evidence of concealment to assure us that assignment was truly random we seek evidence of the method of blinding in trials with blinding of participants or healthcare providers authors should state the similarity of the characteristics of the interventions such as appearance taste smell and method of administration some people have advocated testing for blinding by asking participants or healthcare providers at the end of a trial whether they think the participant received the experimental or control intervention because participants and healthcare providers will usually know whether the participant has experienced the primary outcome this makes it difficult to determine if their responses reflect failure of blinding or accurate assumptions about the efficacy of the intervention given the uncertainty this type of information provides we have removed advocating reporting this type of testing for blinding from the consort  statement we do however advocate that the authors report any known compromises in blinding for example authors should report if it was necessary to unblind any participants at any point during the conduct of a trialitem a statistical methods used to compare groups for primary and secondary outcomesexample—“the primary endpoint was change in bodyweight during the  weeks of the study in the intentiontotreat population … secondary efficacy endpoints included change in waist circumference systolic and diastolic blood pressure prevalence of metabolic syndrome … we used an analysis of covariance ancova for the primary endpoint and for secondary endpoints waist circumference blood pressure and patientreported outcome scores this was supplemented by a repeated measures analysis the ancova model included treatment country and sex as fixed effects and bodyweight at randomisation as covariate we aimed to assess whether data provided evidence of superiority of each liraglutide dose to placebo primary objective and to orlistat secondary objective”explanation—data can be analysed in many ways some of which may not be strictly appropriate in a particular situation it is essential to specify which statistical procedure was used for each analysis and further clarification may be necessary in the results section of the report the principle to follow is to “describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results” wwwicmjeorg it is also important to describe details of the statistical analysis such as intentiontotreat analysis see box almost all methods of analysis yield an estimate of the treatment effect which is a contrast between the outcomes in the comparison groups authors should accompany this by a confidence interval for the estimated effect which indicates a central range of uncertainty for the true treatment effect the confidence interval may be interpreted as the range of values for the treatment effect that is compatible with the observed data it is customary to present a  confidence interval which gives the range expected to include the true value in  of  similar studiesstudy findings can also be assessed in terms of their statistical significance the p value represents the probability that the observed data or a more extreme result could have arisen by chance when the interventions did not truly differ actual p values for example p are strongly preferable to imprecise threshold reports such as p standard methods of analysis assume that the data are “independent” for controlled trials this usually means that there is one observation per participant treating multiple observations from one participant as independent data is a serious error such data are produced when outcomes can be measured on different parts of the body as in dentistry or rheumatology data analysis should be based on counting each participant once  or should be done by using more complex statistical procedures incorrect analysis of multiple observations per individual was seen in   of  trials in rheumatoid arthritisitem b methods for additional analyses such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analysesexamples—“proportions of patients responding were compared between treatment groups with the mantelhaenszel χ test adjusted for the stratification variable methotrexate use”“prespecified subgroup analyses according to antioxidant treatment assignments presence or absence of prior cvd dietary folic acid intake smoking diabetes aspirin hormone therapy and multivitamin use were performed using stratified cox proportional hazards models these analyses used baseline exposure assessments and were restricted to participants with nonmissing subgroup data at baseline”explanation—as is the case for primary analyses the method of subgroup analysis should be clearly specified the strongest analyses are those that look for evidence of a difference in treatment effect in complementary subgroups for example older and younger participants a comparison known as a test of interaction  a common but misleading approach is to compare p values for separate analyses of the treatment effect in each group it is incorrect to infer a subgroup effect interaction from one significant and one nonsignificant p value such inferences have a high false positive ratebecause of the high risk for spurious findings subgroup analyses are often discouraged  post hoc subgroup comparisons analyses done after looking at the data are especially likely not to be confirmed by further studies such analyses do not have great credibilityin some studies imbalances in participant characteristics are adjusted for by using some form of multiple regression analysis although the need for adjustment is much less in rcts than in epidemiological studies an adjusted analysis may be sensible especially if one or more variables is thought to be prognostic ideally adjusted analyses should be specified in the study protocol see item  for example adjustment is often recommended for any stratification variables see item b on the principle that the analysis strategy should follow the design in rcts the decision to adjust should not be determined by whether baseline differences are statistically significant see item   the rationale for any adjusted analyses and the statistical methods used should be specifiedauthors should clarify the choice of variables that were adjusted for indicate how continuous variables were handled and specify whether the analysis was planned or suggested by the data reviews of published studies show that reporting of adjusted analyses is inadequate with regard to all of these aspects   resultsitem  participant flow a diagram is strongly recommended item a for each group the numbers of participants who were randomly assigned received intended treatment and were analysed for the primary outcomeexamples—see figs ⇓ and ⇓fig  flow diagram of a multicentre trial of fractional flow reserve versus angiography for guiding percutaneous coronary intervention pci adapted from tonino et al the diagram includes detailed information on the excluded participantsdownload figure open in new tab download powerpoint fig  flow diagram of minimal surgery compared with medical management for chronic gastrooesophageal reflux disease adapted from grant et al the diagram shows a multicentre trial with a parallel nonrandomised preference group download figure open in new tab download powerpoint explanation—the design and conduct of some rcts is straightforward and the flow of participants particularly were there are no losses to followup or exclusions through each phase of the study can be described adequately in a few sentences in more complex studies it may be difficult for readers to discern whether and why some participants did not receive the treatment as allocated were lost to followup or were excluded from the analysis this information is crucial for several reasons participants who were excluded after allocation are unlikely to be representative of all participants in the study for example patients may not be available for followup evaluation because they experienced an acute exacerbation of their illness or harms of treatment attrition as a result of loss to follow up which is often unavoidable needs to be distinguished from investigatordetermined exclusion for such reasons as ineligibility withdrawal from treatment and poor adherence to the trial protocol erroneous conclusions can be reached if participants are excluded from analysis and imbalances in such omissions between groups may be especially indicative of bias   information about whether the investigators included in the analysis all participants who underwent randomisation in the groups to which they were originally allocated intentiontotreat analysis see item  and box  is therefore of particular importance knowing the number of participants who did not receive the intervention as allocated or did not complete treatment permits the reader to assess to what extent the estimated efficacy of therapy might be underestimated in comparison with ideal circumstancesif available the number of people assessed for eligibility should also be reported although this number is relevant to external validity only and is arguably less important than the other counts it is a useful indicator of whether trial participants were likely to be representative of all eligible participantsa review of rcts published in five leading general and internal medicine journals in  found that reporting of the flow of participants was often incomplete particularly with regard to the number of participants receiving the allocated intervention and the number lost to followup even information as basic as the number of participants who underwent randomisation and the number excluded from analyses was not available in up to  of articles reporting was considerably more thorough in articles that included a diagram of the flow of participants through a trial as recommended by consort this study informed the design of the revised flow diagram in the revised consort statement   the suggested template is shown in fig ⇑ and the counts required are described in detail in table ⇓table   information required to document the flow of participants through each stage of a randomised trial view this tableview popupview inlinesome information such as the number of individuals assessed for eligibility may not always be known and depending on the nature of a trial some counts may be more relevant than others it will sometimes be useful or necessary to adapt the structure of the flow diagram to a particular trial in some situations other information may usefully be added for example the flow diagram of a parallel group trial of minimal surgery compared with medical management for chronic gastrooesophageal reflux also included a parallel nonrandomised preference group see fig  the exact form and content of the flow diagram may be varied according to specific features of a trial for example many trials of surgery or vaccination do not include the possibility of discontinuation although consort strongly recommends using this graphical device to communicate participant flow throughout the study there is no specific prescribed formatitem b for each group losses and exclusions after randomisation together with reasonsexamples—“there was only one protocol deviation in a woman in the study group she had an abnormal pelvic measurement and was scheduled for elective caesarean section however the attending obstetrician judged a trial of labour acceptable caesarean section was done when there was no progress in the first stage of labour”“the monitoring led to withdrawal of nine centres in which existence of some patients could not be proved or other serious violations of good clinical practice had occurred”explanation—some protocol deviations may be reported in the flow diagram see item a—for example participants who did not receive the intended intervention if participants were excluded after randomisation contrary to the intentiontotreat principle because they were found not to meet eligibility criteria see item  they should be included in the flow diagram use of the term “protocol deviation” in published articles is not sufficient to justify exclusion of participants after randomisation the nature of the protocol deviation and the exact reason for excluding participants after randomisation should always be reporteditem a dates defining the periods of recruitment and followupexample—“ageeligible participants were recruited … from february  to september  … participants attended clinic visits at the time of randomisation baseline and at month intervals for  years”explanation—knowing when a study took place and over what period participants were recruited places the study in historical context medical and surgical therapies including concurrent therapies evolve continuously and may affect the routine care given to participants during a trial knowing the rate at which participants were recruited may also be useful especially to other investigatorsthe length of followup is not always a fixed period after randomisation in many rcts in which the outcome is time to an event followup of all participants is ended on a specific date this date should be given and it is also useful to report the minimum maximum and median duration of followup a review of reports in oncology journals that used survival analysis most of which were not rcts  found that nearly   of  reports included the starting and ending dates for accrual of patients but only   of  reports also reported the date on which followup endeditem b why the trial ended or was stoppedexamples—“at the time of the interim analysis the total followup included an estimated  of the total number of patientyears that would have been collected at the end of the study leading to a threshold value of  as determined by the landemets alphaspending function method … at the interim analysis the rr was  in the intervention group as compared with the control group with a p value of  below the threshold value the data and safety monitoring board advised the investigators to interrupt the trial and offer circumcision to the control group who were then asked to come to the investigation centre where mc medical circumcision was advised and proposed … because the study was interrupted some participants did not have a full followup on that date and their visits that were not yet completed are described as “planned” in this article”“in january  problems with vaccine supply necessitated the temporary nationwide replacement of the whole cell component of the combined dpthib vaccine with acellular pertussis vaccine as this vaccine has a different local reactogenicity profile we decided to stop the trial early”explanation—arguably trialists who arbitrarily conduct unplanned interim analyses after very few events accrue using no statistical guidelines run a high risk of “catching” the data at a random extreme which likely represents a large overestimate of treatment benefitreaders will likely draw weaker inferences from a trial that was truncated in a datadriven manner versus one that reports its findings after reaching a goal independent of results thus rcts should indicate why the trial came to an end see box  the report should also disclose factors extrinsic to the trial that affected the decision to stop the trial and who made the decision to stop the trial including reporting the role the funding agency played in the deliberations and in the decision to stop the triala systematic review of  rcts stopped earlier than planned for benefit found that these trials reported stopping after accruing a median of  events estimated a median relative risk of  and a strong relation between the number of events accrued and the size of the effect with smaller trials with fewer events yielding the largest treatment effects odds ratio   conﬁdence interval  to  while an increasing number of trials published in high impact medical journals report stopping early only  of trials reported stopping early for benefit which contrasts with estimates arising from simulation studies and surveys of data safety and monitoring committees thus many trials accruing few participants and reporting large treatment effects may have been stopped earlier than planned but failed to report this actionbox  early stoppingrcts can end when they reach their sample size goal their event count goal their length of followup goal or when they reach their scheduled date of closure in these situations the trial will stop in a manner independent of its results and stopping is unlikely to introduce bias in the results alternatively rcts can stop earlier than planned because of the result of an interim analysis showing larger than expected benefit or harm on the experimental intervention also rcts can stop earlier than planned when investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions that is stopping for futility in addition trials may stop early because the trial becomes unviable funding vanishes researchers cannot access eligible patients or study interventions or the results of other studies make the research question irrelevantfull reporting of why a trial ended is important for evidence based decision making see item b researchers examining why  trials stopped early for benefit found that many failed to report key methodological information regarding how the decision to stop was reached—the planned sample size n interim analysis after which the trial was stopped n or whether a stopping rule informed the decision n item b of the checklist requires the reporting of timing of interim analyses what triggered them how many took place whether these were planned or ad hoc and whether there were statistical guidelines and stopping rules in place a priori furthermore it is helpful to know whether an independent data monitoring committee participated in the analyses and who composed it with particular attention to the role of the funding source and who made the decision to stop often the data safety and monitoring committee makes recommendations and the funders sponsors or the investigators make the decision to stoptrials that stop early for reasons apparently independent of trial findings and trials that reach their planned termination are unlikely to introduce bias by stopping in these cases the authors should report whether interim analyses took place and whether these results were available to the funderthe push for trials that change the intervention in response to interim results thus enabling a faster evaluation of promising interventions for rapidly evolving and fatal conditions will require even more careful reporting of the process and decision to stop trials earlyitem  a table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for each groupexample—see table ⇓table   example of reporting baseline demographic and clinical characteristics adapted from table  of yusuf et alview this tableview popupview inlineexplanation—although the eligibility criteria see item a indicate who was eligible for the trial it is also important to know the characteristics of the participants who were actually included this information allows readers especially clinicians to judge how relevant the results of a trial might be to an individual patientrandomised trials aim to compare groups of participants that differ only with respect to the intervention treatment although proper random assignment prevents selection bias it does not guarantee that the groups are equivalent at baseline any differences in baseline characteristics are however the result of chance rather than bias the study groups should be compared at baseline for important demographic and clinical characteristics so that readers can assess how similar they were baseline data are especially valuable for outcomes that can also be measured at the start of the trial such as blood pressurebaseline information is most efficiently presented in a table see table ⇑ for continuous variables such as weight or blood pressure the variability of the data should be reported along with average values continuous variables can be summarised for each group by the mean and standard deviation when continuous data have an asymmetrical distribution a preferable approach may be to quote the median and a centile range such as the th and th centiles standard errors and confidence intervals are not appropriate for describing variability—they are inferential rather than descriptive statistics variables with a small number of ordered categories such as stages of disease i to iv should not be treated as continuous variables instead numbers and proportions should be reported for each category unfortunately significance tests of baseline differences are still common   they were reported in half of  rcts trials published in leading general journals in  such significance tests assess the probability that observed baseline differences could have occurred by chance however we already know that any differences are caused by chance tests of baseline differences are not necessarily wrong just illogical such hypothesis testing is superfluous and can mislead investigators and their readers rather comparisons at baseline should be based on consideration of the prognostic strength of the variables measured and the size of any chance imbalances that have occurreditem  for each group number of participants denominator included in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned groupsexamples—“the primary analysis was intentiontotreat and involved all patients who were randomly assigned”“one patient in the alendronate group was lost to follow up thus data from  patients were available for the intentiontotreat analysis five patients were considered protocol violators … consequently  patients remained for the perprotocol analyses”explanation—the number of participants in each group is an essential element of the analyses although the flow diagram see item a may indicate the numbers of participants analysed these numbers often vary for different outcome measures the number of participants per group should be given for all analyses for binary outcomes such as risk ratio and risk difference the denominators or event rates should also be reported expressing results as fractions also aids the reader in assessing whether some of the randomly assigned participants were excluded from the analysis it follows that results should not be presented solely as summary measures such as relative risksparticipants may sometimes not receive the full intervention or some ineligible patients may have been randomly allocated in error one widely recommended way to handle such issues is to analyse all participants according to their original group assignment regardless of what subsequently occurred see box  this “intentiontotreat” strategy is not always straightforward to implement it is common for some patients not to complete a study—they may drop out or be withdrawn from active treatment—and thus are not assessed at the end if the outcome is mortality such patients may be included in the analysis based on register information whereas imputation techniques may need to be used if other outcome data are missing the term “intentiontotreat analysis” is often inappropriately used—for example when those who did not receive the first dose of a trial drug are excluded from the analysesconversely analysis can be restricted to only participants who fulfil the protocol in terms of eligibility interventions and outcome assessment this analysis is known as an “ontreatment” or “per protocol” analysis excluding participants from the analysis can lead to erroneous conclusions for example in a trial that compared medical with surgical therapy for carotid stenosis analysis limited to participants who were available for followup showed that surgery reduced the risk for transient ischaemic attack stroke and death however intentiontotreat analysis based on all participants as originally assigned did not show a superior effect of surgeryintentiontotreat analysis is generally favoured because it avoids bias associated with nonrandom loss of participants   regardless of whether authors use the term “intentiontotreat” they should make clear which and how many participants are included in each analysis see item  noncompliance with assigned therapy may mean that the intentiontotreat analysis underestimates the potential benefit of the treatment and additional analyses such as a per protocol analysis may therefore be considered  it should be noted however that such analyses are often considerably flawedin a review of  rcts published in  leading medical journals in    reported the use of intentiontotreat analysis for their primary analysis this proportion was higher for journals adhering to the consort statement  v  among articles that reported the use of intentiontotreat analysis only  actually analysed all participants as randomised with more than  of articles having missing data in their primary analysis other studies show similar findings   trials with no reported exclusions are methodologically weaker in other respects than those that report on some excluded participants strongly indicating that at least some researchers who have excluded participants do not report it another study found that reporting an intentiontotreat analysis was associated with other aspects of good study design and reporting such as describing a sample size calculationbox  intentiontotreat analysisthe special strength of the rct is the avoidance of bias when allocating interventions to trial participants see box  that strength allows strong inferences about cause and effect that are not justified with other study designs in order to preserve fully the huge benefit of randomisation we should include all randomised participants in the analysis all retained in the group to which they were allocated those two conditions define an “intentiontotreat” analysis which is widely recommended as the preferred analysis strategy  intentiontotreat analysis corresponds to analysing the groups exactly as randomised strict intentiontotreat analysis is often hard to achieve for two main reasons—missing outcomes for some participants and nonadherence to the trial protocolmissing outcomesmany trialists exclude patients without an observed outcome often this is reasonable but once any randomised participants are excluded the analysis is not strictly an intentiontotreat analysis indeed most randomised trials have some missing observations trialists effectively must choose between omitting the participants without final outcome data or imputing their missing outcome data a “complete case” or “available case” analysis includes only those whose outcome is known while a few missing outcomes will not cause a problem in half of trials more than  of randomised patients may have missing outcomes this common approach will lose power by reducing the sample size and bias may well be introduced if being lost to followup is related to a patient’s response to treatment there should be concern when the frequency or the causes of dropping out differ between the intervention groupsparticipants with missing outcomes can be included in the analysis only if their outcomes are imputed that is their outcomes are estimated from other information that was collected imputation of the missing data allows the analysis to conform to intentiontotreat analysis but requires strong assumptions which may be hard to justify simple imputation methods are appealing but their use may be inadvisable in particular a widely used method is “last observation carried forward” in which missing final values of the outcome variable are replaced by the last known value before the participant was lost to follow up this is appealing through its simplicity but the method may introduce bias and no allowance is made for the uncertainty of imputation many authors have severely criticised last observation carried forward  nonadherence to the protocola separate issue is that the trial protocol may not have been followed fully for some trial participants common examples are participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria such as wrong diagnosis too young received a proscribed cointervention did not take all the intended treatment or received a different treatment or no intervention the simple way to deal with any protocol deviations is to ignore them all participants can be included in the analysis regardless of adherence to the protocol and this is the intentiontotreat approach thus exclusion of any participants for such reasons is incompatible with intentiontotreat analysisthe term “modified intentiontotreat” is quite widely used to describe an analysis that excludes participants who did not adequately adhere to the protocol in particular those who did not receive a defined minimum amount of the intervention an alternative term is “per protocol” though a per protocol analysis may be appropriate in some settings it should be properly labelled as a nonrandomised observational comparison any exclusion of patients from the analysis compromises the randomisation and may lead to bias in the resultslike “intentiontotreat” none of these other labels reliably clarifies exactly which patients were included thus in the consort checklist we have dropped the specific request for intentiontotreat analysis in favour of a clear description of exactly who was included in each analysisitem a for each primary and secondary outcome results for each group and the estimated effect size and its precision such as  confidence intervalexamples—see tables ⇓ and ⇓table   example of reporting of summary results for each study group binary outcomes adapted from table  of mease et alview this tableview popupview inlinetable   example of reporting of summary results for each study group continuous outcomes adapted from table  of van linschotenview this tableview popupview inlineexplanation—for each outcome study results should be reported as a summary of the outcome in each group for example the number of participants with or without the event and the denominators or the mean and standard deviation of measurements together with the contrast between the groups known as the effect size for binary outcomes the effect size could be the risk ratio relative risk odds ratio or risk difference for survival time data it could be the hazard ratio or difference in median survival time and for continuous data it is usually the difference in means confidence intervals should be presented for the contrast between groups a common error is the presentation of separate confidence intervals for the outcome in each group rather than for the treatment effect trial results are often more clearly displayed in a table rather than in the text as shown in tables ⇑ and ⇑for all outcomes authors should provide a confidence interval to indicate the precision uncertainty of the estimate  a  confidence interval is conventional but occasionally other levels are used many journals require or strongly encourage the use of confidence intervals they are especially valuable in relation to differences that do not meet conventional statistical significance for which they often indicate that the result does not rule out an important clinical difference the use of confidence intervals has increased markedly in recent years although not in all medical specialties although p values may be provided in addition to confidence intervals results should not be reported solely as p values  results should be reported for all planned primary and secondary end points not just for analyses that were statistically significant or “interesting” selective reporting within a study is a widespread and serious problem  in trials in which interim analyses were performed interpretation should focus on the final results at the close of the trial not the interim resultsfor both binary and survival time data expressing the results also as the number needed to treat for benefit or harm can be helpful see item  item b for binary outcomes presentation of both absolute and relative effect sizes is recommendedexample—“the risk of oxygen dependence or death was reduced by   ci  to  the absolute difference was −  ci − to − early administration to an estimated  babies would therefore prevent  baby dying or being longterm dependent on oxygen” also see table ⇓table   example of reporting both absolute and relative effect sizes adapted from table  of the osiris collaborative groupview this tableview popupview inlineexplanation—when the primary outcome is binary both the relative effect risk ratio relative risk or odds ratio and the absolute effect risk difference should be reported with confidence intervals as neither the relative measure nor the absolute measure alone gives a complete picture of the effect and its implications different audiences may prefer either relative or absolute risk but both doctors and lay people tend to overestimate the effect when it is presented in terms of relative risk   the size of the risk difference is less generalisable to other populations than the relative risk since it depends on the baseline risk in the unexposed group which tends to vary across populations for diseases where the outcome is common a relative risk near unity might indicate clinically important differences in public health terms in contrast a large relative risk when the outcome is rare may not be so important for public health although it may be important to an individual in a high risk categoryitem  results of any other analyses performed including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses distinguishing prespecified from exploratoryexample—“on the basis of a study that suggested perioperative βblocker efficacy might vary across baseline risk we prespecified our primary subgroup analysis on the basis of the revised cardiac risk index scoring system we also did prespecified secondary subgroup analyses based on sex type of surgery and use of an epidural or spinal anaesthetic for all subgroup analyses we used cox proportional hazard models that incorporated tests for interactions designated to be significant at p … figure  shows the results of our prespecified subgroup analyses and indicates consistency of effects … our subgroup analyses were underpowered to detect the modest differences in subgroup effects that one might expect to detect if there was a true subgroup effect”explanation—multiple analyses of the same data create a risk for false positive findings authors should resist the temptation to perform many subgroup analyses   analyses that were prespecified in the trial protocol see item  are much more reliable than those suggested by the data and therefore authors should report which analyses were prespecified if subgroup analyses were undertaken authors should report which subgroups were examined why if they were prespecified and how many were prespecified selective reporting of subgroup analyses could lead to bias when evaluating a subgroup the question is not whether the subgroup shows a statistically significant result but whether the subgroup treatment effects are significantly different from each other to determine this a test of interaction is helpful although the power for such tests is typically low if formal evaluations of interaction are undertaken see item b they should be reported as the estimated difference in the intervention effect in each subgroup with a confidence interval not just as p valuesin one survey  of  trial reports included subgroup analyses of which only  used tests of interaction it was often difficult to determine whether subgroup analyses had been specified in the protocol in another survey of surgical trials published in high impact journals  of  trials reported  subgroup analyses of which  were post hoc and only  of subgroup analyses used a test of interaction to assess whether a subgroup effect existedsimilar recommendations apply to analyses in which adjustment was made for baseline variables if done both unadjusted and adjusted analyses should be reported authors should indicate whether adjusted analyses including the choice of variables to adjust for were planned ideally the trial protocol should state whether adjustment is made for nominated baseline variables by using analysis of covariance adjustment for variables because they differ significantly at baseline is likely to bias the estimated treatment effect a survey found that unacknowledged discrepancies between protocols and publications were found for all  trials reporting subgroup analyses and for  of  trials reporting adjusted analysesitem  all important harms or unintended effects in each groupfor specific guidance see consort for harmsexample—“the proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event was similar between the rbpi recombinant bactericidalpermeabilityincreasing protein and placebo groups   of  and   of  respectively and it was lower in patients treated with rbpi than in those treated with placebo for  of  body systems … the proportion of patients experiencing a severe adverse event as judged by the investigators was numerically lower in the rbpi group than the placebo group   of  versus   of  patients respectively there were only three serious adverse events reported as drugrelated and they all occurred in the placebo group”explanation—readers need information about the harms as well as the benefits of interventions to make rational and balanced decisions the existence and nature of adverse effects can have a major impact on whether a particular intervention will be deemed acceptable and useful not all reported adverse events observed during a trial are necessarily a consequence of the intervention some may be a consequence of the condition being treated randomised trials offer the best approach for providing safety data as well as efficacy data although they cannot detect rare harmsmany reports of rcts provide inadequate information on adverse events a survey of  drug trials published from  to  showed that only  had adequate reporting of clinical adverse events and  had adequate reporting of laboratory defined toxicity more recently a comparison between the adverse event data submitted to the trials database of the national cancer institute which sponsored the trials and the information reported in journal articles found that low grade adverse events were underreported in journal articles high grade events common toxicity criteria grades  to  were reported inconsistently in the articles and the information regarding attribution to investigational drugs was incomplete moreover a review of trials published in six general medical journals in  to  found that although  of  reports mentioned adverse events no information on severe adverse events and withdrawal of patients due to an adverse event was given on  and  of articles respectivelyan extension of the consort statement has been developed to provide detailed recommendations on the reporting of harms in randomised trials recommendations and examples of appropriate reporting are freely available from the consort website wwwconsortstatementorg they complement the consort  statement and should be consulted particularly if the study of harms was a key objective briefly if data on adverse events were collected events should be listed and defined with reference to standardised criteria where appropriate the methods used for data collection and attribution of events should be described for each study arm the absolute risk of each adverse event using appropriate metrics for recurrent events and the number of participants withdrawn due to harms should be presented finally authors should provide a balanced discussion of benefits and harmsdiscussionitem  trial limitations addressing sources of potential bias imprecision and if relevant multiplicity of analysesexample—“the preponderance of male patients  is a limitation of our study … we used baremetal stents since drugeluting stents were not available until late during accrual although the latter factor may be perceived as a limitation published data indicate no benefit either shortterm or longterm with respect to death and myocardial infarction in patients with stable coronary artery disease who receive drugeluting stents as compared with those who receive baremetal stents”explanation—the discussion sections of scientific reports are often filled with rhetoric supporting the authors’ findings and provide little measured argument of the pros and cons of the study and its results some journals have attempted to remedy this problem by encouraging more structure to authors’ discussion of their results  for example annals of internal medicine recommends that authors structure the discussion section by presenting  a brief synopsis of the key findings  consideration of possible mechanisms and explanations  comparison with relevant findings from other published studies whenever possible including a systematic review combining the results of the current study with the results of all previous relevant studies  limitations of the present study and methods used to minimise and compensate for those limitations and  a brief section that summarises the clinical and research implications of the work as appropriate we recommend that authors follow these sensible suggestions perhaps also using suitable subheadings in the discussion sectionalthough discussion of limitations is frequently omitted from research reports identification and discussion of the weaknesses of a study have particular importance for example a surgical group reported that laparoscopic cholecystectomy a technically difficult procedure had significantly lower rates of complications than the more traditional open cholecystectomy for management of acute cholecystitis however the authors failed to discuss an obvious bias in their results the study investigators had completed all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies whereas  of the open cholecystectomies had been completed by traineesauthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study including measurement of a primary outcome see item a or diagnosis see item a perhaps the scale used was validated on an adult population but used in a paediatric one or the assessor was not trained in how to administer the instrumentthe difference between statistical significance and clinical importance should always be borne in mind authors should particularly avoid the common error of interpreting a nonsignificant result as indicating equivalence of interventions the confidence interval see item a provides valuable insight into whether the trial result is compatible with a clinically important effect regardless of the p valueauthors should exercise special care when evaluating the results of trials with multiple comparisons such multiplicity arises from several interventions outcome measures time points subgroup analyses and other factors in such circumstances some statistically significant findings are likely to result from chance aloneitem  generalisability external validity applicability of the trial findingsexamples—“as the intervention was implemented for both sexes all ages all types of sports and at different levels of sports the results indicate that the entire range of athletes from young elite to intermediate and recreational senior athletes would benefit from using the presented training programme for the prevention of recurrences of ankle sprain by including nonmedically treated and medically treated athletes we covered a broad spectrum of injury severity this suggests that the present training programme can be implemented in the treatment of all athletes furthermore as it is reasonable to assume that ankle sprains not related to sports are comparable with those in sports the programme could benefit the general population”“this replicates and extends the work of clarke and colleagues and demonstrates that this cb cognitive behavioural prevention program can be reliably and effectively delivered in different settings by clinicians outside of the group who originally developed the intervention the effect size was consistent with those of previously reported singlesite indicated depression prevention studies and was robust across sites with respect to both depressive disorders and symptoms … in this generalisability trial we chose a comparison condition that is relevant to public health—usual care … the sample also was predominantly working class to middle class with access to health insurance given evidence that cb therapy can be more efficacious for adolescents from homes with higher incomes it will be important to test the effects of this prevention program with more economically and ethnically diverse samples”explanation—external validity also called generalisability or applicability is the extent to which the results of a study can be generalised to other circumstances internal validity the extent to which the design and conduct of the trial eliminate the possibility of bias is a prerequisite for external validity the results of a flawed trial are invalid and the question of its external validity becomes irrelevant there is no absolute external validity the term is meaningful only with regard to clearly specified conditions that were not directly examined in the trial can results be generalised to an individual participant or groups that differ from those enrolled in the trial with regard to age sex severity of disease and comorbid conditions are the results applicable to other drugs within a class of similar drugs to a different dose timing and route of administration and to different concomitant therapies can similar results be expected at the primary secondary and tertiary levels of care what about the effect on related outcomes that were not assessed in the trial and the importance of length of followup and duration of treatment especially with respect to harmsexternal validity is a matter of judgment and depends on the characteristics of the participants included in the trial the trial setting the treatment regimens tested and the outcomes assessed  it is therefore crucial that adequate information be described about eligibility criteria and the setting and location see item b the interventions and how they were administered see item  the definition of outcomes see item  and the period of recruitment and followup see item  the proportion of control group participants in whom the outcome develops control group risk is also important the proportion of eligible participants who refuse to enter the trial as indicated on the flowchart see item  is relevant for the generalisability of the trial as it may indicate preferences for or acceptability of an intervention similar considerations may apply to clinician preferences several issues are important when results of a trial are applied to an individual patient   although some variation in treatment response between an individual patient and the patients in a trial or systematic review is to be expected the differences tend to be in magnitude rather than directionalthough there are important exceptions therapies especially drugs  found to be beneficial in a narrow range of patients generally have broader application in actual practice frameworks for the evaluation of external validity have been proposed including qualitative studies such as in integral “process evaluations” and checklists measures that incorporate baseline risk when calculating therapeutic effects such as the number needed to treat to obtain one additional favourable outcome and the number needed to treat to produce one adverse effect are helpful in assessing the benefittorisk balance in an individual patient or group with characteristics that differ from the typical trial participant   finally after deriving patient centred estimates for the potential benefit and harm from an intervention the clinician must integrate them with the patient’s values and preferences for therapy similar considerations apply when assessing the generalisability of results to different settings and interventionsitem  interpretation consistent with results balancing benefits and harms and considering other relevant evidenceexample—“studies published before  suggested that prophylactic immunotherapy also reduced nosocomial infections in verylowbirthweight infants however these studies enrolled small numbers of patients employed varied designs preparations and doses and included diverse study populations in this large multicenter randomised controlled trial the repeated prophylactic administration of intravenous immune globulin failed to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections significantly in premature infants weighing  to  g at birth”explanation—readers will want to know how the present trial’s results relate to those of other rcts this can best be achieved by including a formal systematic review in the results or discussion section of the report    such synthesis may be impractical for trial authors but it is often possible to quote a systematic review of similar trials a systematic review may help readers assess whether the results of the rct are similar to those of other trials in the same topic area and whether participants are similar across studies reports of rcts have often not dealt adequately with these points bayesian methods can be used to statistically combine the trial data with previous evidencewe recommend that at a minimum the discussion should be as systematic as possible and be based on a comprehensive search rather than being limited to studies that support the results of the current trialother informationitem  registration number and name of trial registryexample—“the trial is registered at clinicaltrialsgov number nct ”explanation—the consequences of nonpublication of entire trials  selective reporting of outcomes within trials and of per protocol rather than intentiontotreat analysis have been well documented   covert redundant publication of clinical trials can also cause problems particularly for authors of systematic reviews when results from the same trial are inadvertently included more than onceto minimise or avoid these problems there have been repeated calls over the past  years to register clinical trials at their inception to assign unique trial identification numbers and to record other basic information about the trial so that essential details are made publicly available    provoked by recent serious problems of withholding data there has been a renewed effort to register randomised trials indeed the world health organisation states that “the registration of all interventional trials is a scientific ethical and moral responsibility” wwwwhointictrpen by registering a randomised trial authors typically report a minimal set of information and obtain a unique trial registration numberin september  the international committee of medical journal editors icmje changed their policy saying that they would consider trials for publication only if they had been registered before the enrolment of the first participant this resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of trials being registered the icmje gives guidance on acceptable registries wwwicmjeorgfaqpdfin a recent survey of  high impact factor medical journals’ instructions to authors  journals specifically stated that all recent clinical trials must be registered as a requirement of submission to that journalauthors should provide the name of the register and the trial’s unique registration number if authors had not registered their trial they should explicitly state this and give the reasonitem  where the full trial protocol can be accessed if availableexample—“full details of the trial protocol can be found in the supplementary appendix available with the full text of this article at wwwnejmorg”explanation—a protocol for the complete trial rather than a protocol of a specific procedure within a trial is important because it prespecifies the methods of the randomised trial such as the primary outcome see item a having a protocol can help to restrict the likelihood of undeclared post hoc changes to the trial methods and selective outcome reporting see item b elements that may be important for inclusion in the protocol for a randomised trial are described elsewherethere are several options for authors to consider ensuring their trial protocol is accessible to interested readers as described in the example above journals reporting a trial’s primary results can make the trial protocol available on their web site accessibility to the trial results and protocol is enhanced when the journal is open access some journals such as trials publish trial protocols and such a publication can be referenced when reporting the trial’s principal results trial registration see item  will also ensure that many trial protocol details are available as the minimum trial characteristics included in an approved trial registration database includes several protocol items and results wwwwhointictrpen trial investigators may also be able to post their trial protocol on a website through their employer whatever mechanism is used we encourage all trial investigators to make their protocol easily accessible to interested readersitem  sources of funding and other support such as supply of drugs role of fundersexamples—“grant support was received for the intervention from plan international and for the research from the wellcome trust and joint united nations programme on hivaids unaids the funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript”“this study was funded by glaxosmithkline pharmaceuticals glaxosmithkline was involved in the design and conduct of the study and provided logistical support during the trial employees of the sponsor worked with the investigators to prepare the statistical analysis plan but the analyses were performed by the university of utah the manuscript was prepared by dr shaddy and the steering committee members glaxosmithkline was permitted to review the manuscript and suggest changes but the final decision on content was exclusively retained by the authors”explanation—authors should report the sources of funding for the trial as this is important information for readers assessing a trial studies have showed that research sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry are more likely to produce results favouring the product made by the company sponsoring the research than studies funded by other sources    a systematic review of  studies on funding found that research funded by the pharmaceutical industry had four times the odds of having outcomes favouring the sponsor than research funded by other sources odds ratio   confidence interval  to  a large proportion of trial publications do not currently report sources of funding the degree of underreporting is difficult to quantify a survey of  drug trials found that  failed to report sources of funding in another survey of pubmed indexed randomised trials published in december  source of funding was reported for  of the  trialsthe level of involvement by a funder and their influence on the design conduct analysis and reporting of a trial varies it is therefore important that authors describe in detail the role of the funders if the funder had no such involvement the authors should state so similarly authors should report any other sources of support such as supply and preparation of drugs or equipment or in the analysis of data and writing of the manuscriptreporting rcts that did not have a two group parallel designthe primary focus of the consort recommendations is rcts with a parallel design and two treatment groups most rcts have that design but a substantial minority do not   of rcts published in december  and   in december most of the consort statement applies equally to all trial designs but there are a few additional issues to address for each design before the publication of the revised consort statement in  the consort group decided to develop extensions to the main consort statement relevant to specific trial designs extensions have been published relating to reporting of cluster randomised trials and noninferiority and equivalence trials lack of resources has meant that other planned extensions have not been completed they will cover trials with the following designs multiarm parallel factorial crossover withinpersonauthors reporting trials with a cluster design or using a noninferiority or equivalence framework should consult the consort recommendations in addition to those in this document here we make a few interim comments about the other designs in each case the trial design should be made clear in both the main text and the article’s abstractmultiarm  group parallel group trials need the least modification of the standard consort guidance the flow diagram can be extended easily the main differences from trials with two groups relate to clarification of how the study hypotheses relate to the multiple groups and the consequent methods of data analysis and interpretation for factorial trials the possibility of interaction between the interventions generally needs to be considered in addition to overall comparisons of participants who did or did not receive each intervention under study investigators should consider also reporting results for each treatment combinationin crossover trials each participant receives two or more treatments in a random order the main additional issues to address relate to the paired nature of the data which affect design and analysis similar issues affect withinperson comparisons in which participants receive two treatments simultaneously often to paired organs also because of the risk of temporal or systemic carryover effects respectively in both cases the choice of design needs justificationthe consort group intends to publish extensions to consort to cover all these designs in addition we will publish updates to existing guidance for cluster randomised trials and noninferiority and equivalence trials to take account of this major update of the generic consort guidancediscussionassessment of healthcare interventions can be misleading unless investigators ensure unbiased comparisons random allocation to study groups remains the only method that eliminates selection and confounding biases nonrandomised trials tend to result in larger estimated treatment effects than randomised trials bias jeopardises even rcts however if investigators carry out such trials improperly a recent systematic review aggregating the results of several methodological investigations found that for subjective outcomes trials that used inadequate or unclear allocation concealment yielded  larger estimates of effect than those that used adequate concealment and trials that were not blinded yielded  larger estimates as might be expected there was a strong association between the twothe design and implementation of an rct require methodological as well as clinical expertise meticulous effort  and a high level of alertness for unanticipated difficulties reports of rcts should be written with similarly close attention to reducing bias readers should not have to speculate the methods used should be complete and transparent so that readers can readily differentiate trials with unbiased results from those with questionable results sound science encompasses adequate reporting and the conduct of ethical trials rests on the footing of sound sciencewe hope this update of the consort explanatory article will assist authors in using the  version of consort and explain in general terms the importance of adequately reporting of trials the consort statement can help researchers designing trials in future and can guide peer reviewers and editors in their evaluation of manuscripts indeed we encourage peer reviewers and editors to use the consort checklist to assess whether authors have reported on these items such assessments will likely improve the clarity and transparency of published trials because consort is an evolving document it requires a dynamic process of continual assessment refinement and if necessary change which is why we have this update of the checklist and explanatory article as new evidence and critical comments accumulate we will evaluate the need for future updatesthe first version of the consort statement from  seems to have led to improvement in the quality of reporting of rcts in the journals that have adopted it     other groups are using the consort template to improve the reporting of other research designs such as diagnostic tests and observational studiesthe consort website wwwconsortstatementorg has been established to provide educational material and a repository database of materials relevant to the reporting of rcts the site includes many examples from real trials including all of the examples included in this article we will continue to add good and bad examples of reporting to the database and we invite readers to submit further suggestions by contacting us through the website the consort group will continue to survey the literature to find relevant articles that address issues relevant to the reporting of rcts and we invite authors of any such articles to notify us about them all of this information will be made accessible through the consort website which is updated regularlymore than  leading general and specialty journals and biomedical editorial groups including the icmje world association of medical journal editors and the council of science editors have given their official support to consort we invite other journals concerned about the quality of reporting of clinical trials to endorse the consort statement and contact us through our website to let us know of their support the ultimate benefactors of these collective efforts should be people who for whatever reason require intervention from the healthcare communitynotescite this as bmj cfootnoteswe are grateful to frank davidoff and tom lang
