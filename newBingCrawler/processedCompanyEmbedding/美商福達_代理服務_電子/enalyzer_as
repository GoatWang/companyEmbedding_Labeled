read more as we all know customer feedback is essential to improving your product and to understand your users however every day organizations struggle to collect valuable feedback that’s why we want to talk about feedback forms feedback forms when done correctly are an excellent tool to understand user experience they’re easy to digest and fill in which also makes them easy to build and design here are  things to considering when designing and distributing a feedback form → check out a simple feedback form  images are powerful feedback allowing respondents to upload screenshots straight from their mobiles tablets and desktops is a need to have not only will it be easier for them to explain themselves but you will also understand their feedback better with enalyzer you’ll get an easytounderstand overview of the uploaded images in your reports and raw data files  don’t force them to provide information if someone is giving you feedback they should provide you with all the relevant information right yes but the one deciding what qualifies as “relevant” information is the customer remember they’re using their time to help you out in other words they’re doing you a favor if they don’t want to answer all your questions or simply don’t have the time don’t force them nevertheless if you need more information from them just contact them and ask this approach is better and will guarantee a higher response rate  ensure it works on all devices your users can come across your brand anywhere which means they might be on their phone or tablet make your form accessible to them by ensuring its responsive and it resizes to any device it’s viewed on enalyzer is  responsive not only for your respondents but for you as the survey administrator and whoever you share your report with so you and your team can keep up with your feedback anytime and anywhere  update your form your product service andor website will always be developing and moving forward so make sure your form adapts to these changes every once in a while make sure that what you’re asking is still relevant and will provide you with an understanding of your user’s experience  less will give you more users that are going to report a bug feature request or just general feedback don’t want to use too much time they’re willing to share their experience with you but it has to be easy cluttered forms will turn people away since they look timeconsuming which makes everything worse if the user is filing a bug report so what do you do keep it simple uncluttered and easy on the eye – this goes for the design and content – and watch the feedback tick in  location location location feedback forms are like real estate location is all that matters well not exactly but you get where we’re going with this one users are not going to spend their time trying to find your form so make sure it’s in logical places within your app and website → create a free account th april  unleash the power of your

before and you know what we’re doing again why because nps when used right is a powerful tool for any business and organization but first let’s recap what is it nps is a metric developed in  by fred reichheld as a way to measure customer loyalty how does it work nps is based on a single and simple question “how likely is it that you would recommend this companyproductservice to a friend or colleague” however we recommend you add an open answer question this way you allow respondents to elaborate on whatever score they’ve given you and it helps you take action how is the score calculated the nps ranges from  to  and it can be seen as a report card for your company product or service grading the overall customer experience respondents are segmented into three groups according to the rating they gave promoters score  –  are loyal and will recommend you to their networks they are your ambassadors and are therefore more likely to remain customers and increase their purchases over time passives score  –  are satisfied for now but your company product andor service didn’t leave a lasting or permanent impact they won’t vouch for you but may mention you within the right context detractors score   are not happy they will actively spread negative wordofmouth and tend to be louder and scarier than promoters what does the score mean we find that people often wonder what their score means and how to deal with it well the nps is the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors therefore a positive score means you have more promoters than detractors and vice versa to increase your nps you have to boost the percentage of promoters by reducing passives and detractors this gives you a straightforward metric that you can share with your employees and use as a motivation tool to provide the best customer experience possible nevertheless if you want to turn your insights into action you should start digging deeper into your nps the real value of your nps is revealed when you start tracking it over time therefore it’s imperative that you send out nps surveys after critical touch points allowing you to identify trends and figuring out what works and what doesn’t identify trends the trend of your nps is more important than the score itself customer attitudes change constantly and they may depend on various factors you want to be able to understand and identify nps trends and make strategies accordingly for example a healthy trend would be to see an increase in promoters among those customers that have been with you the longest if this is not the case you might be running the risk of losing longterm customers meaning that you need to pay close attention to the openended feedback and identify the factors that are causing this trend pro tip send your nps survey immediately after the customer has been in contact with your company product or service for example right after customer support solves their query quantify effects of changes to your product or service by tracking your nps over time you can quantify whether changes you make to your product or service affect the customer experience this enables you to figure out what works and what doesn’t and allows you to address concerns immediately for example if your customers are experiencing bugs related to a recent feature release this might reflect negatively on your customer’s support nps tracking your nps will reflect this and show that the problem is not necessarily related to your support agents but to the unexpected bugs consequently your strategy will be focused on improving feature releases instead of wasting resources in adding support agents with enalyzer you can use time series charts to track your nps over time and get a clear overview of your customer segments enalyzer reports show realtime updated data allowing you to act immediately to your customer’s feedback and therefore improve the customer experience you provide → start tracking th april  find your

surveyors asking “where do i find people to take my survey” today there are multiple ways to reach your respondents however this doesn’t mean they’re all applicable to your survey for example your customer service feedback survey should be sent to customers that interact with your customer support therefore the best way to reach them will most likely be sending a followup email after customer support has solved their query that’s why you should start by identifying your target audience and then figuring out the best collection methods to reach them but don’t worry we’re not leaving you alone on this one here are some collection methods we recommend email if you have an existing list of contacts that have agreed to receive emails from you eg newsletter list then you can send your survey to them email as a collection method is often used for employee and customer surveys and it’s a great way to add existing background variables such as department and industry for a better report social media you can share your survey to twitter facebook linkedin google or any other social platform that your audience uses as a bonus enalyzer allows you to add social media icons to your survey so your respondents can share your survey with their networks to weed out respondents outside of your targeting audience add screening questions to your survey for example if your survey seeks to find out attitudes about trust in politicians among voters make sure that your respondents are  years old by adding a question “how old are you” if the respondent is  or younger set up a condition so that the respondent is directed to an end page thanking them for their willingness to participate in your survey but unfortunately they don’t fit the adequate target group inperson sometimes you have to go to where your respondents are for example if you’re conducting a survey about your hair salon and its facilities it might be a good idea to ask people as they’re leaving set up a tablet in your store to make it easier for your respondents panel panel companies can match your survey with online respondents for a fee there are plenty of online survey panel companies out there all you have to do is find one that specializes in what you’re looking for describe your project to them and they’ll find a solution that fits your needs if you’re interested in this you’re welcome to contact one of our consultants and hear more they can do the whole survey for you or you can create your own survey and they will match you with the right panel collection methods are not mutually exclusive which means you can and should combine the necessary methods that will help you reach your target audience whatever you decide remember that it all starts with your target audience → create a free account

that you have your survey and design all lined up it’s time to invite respondents to your survey this may seem like the easiest step in research how hard can gathering data be let me burst your bubble and tell you this is one of the most important aspects of survey research and can determine the fate of the entire research endeavor no pressure you need to make sure that you target the right respondents so that they accurately represent what you wish to look into but how do you ensure accurate targeting without introducing a source of bias to your research bias is the concurring evil of all research so here are  things to consider  the what and the who research interest and population size when determining who should answer your survey and how they get a hold of your survey you first need to figure out what your research interest is it doesn’t make sense to survey all students at the university of oxford if you’re trying to figure out how satisfied students are with the dorms at the university for this you need to define your population which is the entirety of your research subjects for this example the population is the number of students living in the university of oxford’s dorms however it’s often impossible to survey an entire population due to time and cost issues luckily most of the time surveying the entire population isn’t necessary drawing inferences from samples often get you pretty close to the actual population just be mindful of the inherent uncertainty they carry  random sampling in order to achieve a result that comes as close to the truth as possible you need to carefully sample your respondents a sample frame is a list containing the entire population from which a random sample is drawn continuing with the above example this would be a list of all students living in the dorms from which random names are selected to participate in the survey you need to make sure that each student has the same chance of being selected so that you can minimize the sampling error the natural deviation between sample and population this is called probability sampling  sample size we know you’ve been waiting for this one the answer to the question how many respondents do i need well… that depends on many factors but don’t worry we have a formula for you let’s not get ahead of ourselves and take this one step at a time you have to set the maximum error you’re willing to accept in your survey when doing this you should be aware of the following two parameters margin of error and confidence level the margin of error is the interval within which you expect to find the value from the population you’re measuring for instance let’s say you wish to determine how large the proportion of the  students in the dorm are exchange students if we assume that  are exchange students  of the population with  margin of error it really means it is about   and   the confidence level expresses how confident you feel about the value you look for within the margin of error for example in the previous case if you choose a  confidence level we could say the percentage of students in the dorm that are exchange students in  of the cases is between  and  in other words if we repeat the survey  times the proportion we’re looking for would be within the interval  of the cases and it would be out the interval in the remaining  of the cases the margin of error confidence level and sample size are always linked and codependent modifying any of these values will change the others minimizing the margin of error will require a bigger sample size increasing the confidence level will require a bigger sample size so once you’ve decided on the margin of error and the confidence level you can use the formula to determine your sample size pro tip as a reference the margin of error in political polls is usually  n sample size to be calculated n size of the population eg   students z refers to the confidence level and is derived from a statistical distribution confidence level   z confidence level   z confidence level   z e maximum margin of error i tolerate eg  p proportion we expect to find as a general rule if we don’t have any information about the value we expect to find we use p   nonresponse and response bias once you’ve determined your ideal sample size add a couple extra why you ask because there will most likely be some who don’t want to answer your survey to counter the effects of people not responding you may want to increase your sample size by the expected nonresponse rate so why should you care this has got to do with two more biases related to your respondents that may influence your data a response bias is mainly on the side of the respondent who doesn’t understand the question or is lying while answering the question you can counter this by making sure your questions are properly phrased and that respondents trust that their answers are anonymous andor confidential th january  quiz better

informal the internet is full of entertainment quizzes that question people’s knowledge of pop culture or political awareness quizzes however can also be used in formal settings eg pop quizzes in us schools quiz results are often graded and shared with the respondent a while after they’ve taken the quiz but what if your respondents could see the results when they reach the end of your quiz this will transform your quiz into an interactive experience and can serve as an incentive for people to answer and reshare your quiz example → check it out to say goodbye to  and hello to  we launched a new year’s quiz where we tested people’s knowledge of some of the things that occurred in  as soon as respondents finished the quiz they were redirected to a report showing the correct answers and how people had answered this allowed respondents to test their own knowledge and measure it against others a quiz like this can be made more interactive by for example adding some demographic questions such as age this will allow you to compare results based on respondents’ age and inciting a bit of competition → create a free account and try it yourself fun fact the word ‘quiz’ is only  years old give or take and it has had several meanings in   fanny burney used the word to refer to ‘an odd or eccentric person’ also around  ‘quiz’ was the name for a toy today’s use of them term refers to ‘a test of knowledge’ this meaning emerged in the midth century and the origin is hard to account for th january  making better estimates how to deal with sample uncertainty every measurement is subject

to forget this a common mistake researchers usually make when interpreting results is ignoring the uncertainty of samples which leads to decisions based on wrong data interpretations to make sure we’re all on the same page let’s start with the basics what are samples and what do we use them for market researchers and analysts are usually interested in obtaining knowledge from a certain population eg all employees in an organization getting data from the entire population would be ideal however this might be impossible to obtain for various reasons the most common ones being time and money instead researchers use a sample of that specific population the common approach is to run statistics on the specific sample and use the results as “estimates” for the entire population now that we got that covered let’s move on to an example pure digital is a marketing agency and they have a customer base of  customers they want their customers to rate their satisfaction of the marketing services pure digital provides to do so they create a one question survey and send it to a subset of  customers on a yearly basis → check it out  based on the data collected from these  customers pure digital calculates an average satisfaction score for each year here’s where the common mistake happens researchers and analysts tend to look at the above and conclude that customer satisfaction is deteriorating but is it no it’s not the problem this conclusion is based on the assumption that  in the sample represents  in the total population and in the previous years the same is true for the average satisfaction of  this is not correct if a different sample had been taken the average satisfaction might have been the same or entirely different in the above example pure digital got entirely by chance some more or less dissatisfied customers into the sample that influenced the average rating thus concluding that the satisfaction score based on the sample is a good indication of how satisfied the  customers are what the market researcher didn’t do is take into account the inherent uncertainty with regard to the satisfaction scores the consequences if you don’t consider this uncertainty you might end up overreacting or underreacting for example let’s assume that all  customers are satisfied on average at  while the sample tells us  what would the conclusion then be well here we mistakenly conclude that our company is not performing successfully when in fact we are doing well however if all customers have an average satisfaction level of  and the sample still says  then we might think that we’re not doing as bad as we actually are in short if we assume that a statistic such as an average from a sample is the same in the total population we make mistakes mistakes that can potentially be costly and timeconsuming the solution in statistics the average of a sample would be referred to as a point estimate a point estimate by itself might be a good start but it doesn’t provide any information about how “good” this estimate is – it doesn’t take into account the uncertainty to get an idea of the error that we might have because we have a sample and not the total population we can use confidence intervals aka range estimates contrary to point estimates a range estimate provides a whole range of potential population estimates that are likely to be true the correct interpretation of data for the example above instead of assuming that the  average of the sample can be generalized to the total population pure digital should compute the confidence interval and base their decisionmaking on a statement that says “we can be  confident that the true population average ranges between  and ” we started with a simple point estimate satisfaction of all customers is  to a range estimate it is quite likely –  – that satisfaction ranges between  and  the difference here is vital because it directly affects decisions in this case we could conclude that the difference between  and the quite likely  of this year is not big enough for pure digital to engage into redesigning the marketing services they offer in conclusion by taking random samples and computing range estimates instead of point estimates we acknowledge that our estimate of the population is to some degree uncertain and we are better equipped to avoid costly under or overreactions →

in history as the day the united states of america elected mr donald j trump which needless to say came as a surprise to many people especially pollsters during the past weeks there has been quite a few finger pointing towards the polls many are wondering how did the polls get this so wrong we decided to have a little chat with our head of research henrik nielsen so he could shed light on this matter this is not the first time polls have gotten it wrong right have you ever heard of the shy tory factor it refers to the british general elections of  and  when the conservative party aka the tories significantly proved the polls wrong in both elections polls didn’t take into account conservative voters that hid their support for the conservative party last year danish parliament election polls also got it wrong none of them predicted the rise of the danish people’s party just this summer we were all witnesses to brexit even though all the polls predicted a win for remain does this mean that we’re going to stop using polls to predict elections among other things many political experts who got this election completely wrong have already started to proclaim that this marks the end of polling and are calling polls a wild goose chase we should take this with a grain of salt since they are trying to protect their own brand as political experts in other words no this is not the end of polling polls attract readers viewers and clicks which in turn brings in advertising money and as liza minelli says money makes the world go around it’s not the end of polling but should it be polls are not a wild goose chase even though many are calling them that polls are useful and render excellent data however pollsters need to start reexamining the methods used in polling just like in  britain before the  us election experts already started dismissing “shy trump” supporters they based this dismissal on preelection polls – ironic right back to your original question pollsters need to increase their efforts and revise the way they do things and the rest of us need to remember that even if the evidence says otherwise polling carries uncertainty what should pollsters do in the future the french presidential election is coming up in the spring of  so all of us especially pollsters need to look out for the “shy trump” phenomenon as i said before looking at polls is not a wild goose chase but as in all aspects of life polls have to be done according to the  p’s – proper preparation and planning prevents piss poor performance the future of polling requires that pollsters find a way to handle the “shy trump” phenomenon i will be following and suggest everyone does the polls on the french presidential election and see if the pollsters are able to figure out a way to handle the “shy trump” phenomenon or whether marie le pen and the national front will get a much better result than the polls predict… the poll we conducted about the us election showed that  would’ve voted for hillary clinton did we also get it wrong ha first things first our poll is not representative that being said it did show something interesting it suggested that the majority of respondents would rather enjoy a beer in the company of mr trump than mrs clinton this question serves as a proxy for the winner of the election since it turned out to be a better forecast of the us election result than  of polls used the media coverage are you saying enalyzer saw it coming no not at all but it’s still funny also wouldn’t you rather admit to a beer than to a vote for the us presidency did anyone see it coming yes there was in fact one poll that foresaw the victory of mr donald trump however this poll was written off as nonsense by the majority of the high esteemed panel of political experts

question since apparently everyone thinks it’s hard well we don’t think so and that’s why our experts created the customer loyalty template it’ll help you understand your customers’ experience with your organization and allow you to identify where you need to work harder and where you’re succeeding  ask customers why they left nobody likes rejection but it happens we understand the urge to grab a glass of wine and sulk the day away after losing a customer as appealing as that sounds we have a more productive option ask the customer why they left use their feedback to make improvements for your current and future customers you can quickly get started with our customer exit template and when you’re done reward yourself with a glass of wine  take care of employees as employers you want to make sure your employees are happy motivated and engaged but let’s face it people would rather share pictures of their recent trip to bali with the world than their honest opinion with their bosses so what can you do we already talked about this but the gist is that we recommend anonymous surveys to gather honest employee feedback you can use our employee engagement template it’ll only take a few clicks  listen to work newbies starting a new job can be scary and daunting maybe even slightly awkward that’s why employers should do whatever they can to ensure new employees are properly and professionally welcomed to the organization however have you considered the fact that we all have blind spots and you could be overlooking something instead of wondering what it could be you can ask the new employees we recommend our employee entry templates that focus on the first  and the first  days of the new job  plan your next party all work and no play makes for a boring life isn’t that how the line goes it’s important to blow off some steam once in a while with that in mind we refuse the idea that party planning should feel like work which led us to create two templates for you event planning and summer party combine them or use them individually they’ll cover rsvp dietary preferences who brings what and loads more  put hypotheses to the test surveys are a great way to test hypotheses about attitudes and behaviors in regards to anything education markets politics you name it when used correctly online surveys can be a powerful tool for academic research you might not need them since research is topic specific nevertheless our experts did the reading for you and created several survey templates based on academic articles on branding service quality product design and more  don’t limit yourself the enalyzer research team has created more templates just for you and no matter the template you choose you can use it as is or customize it to fit your needs we also invite you to create your own survey from scratch and believe it or not you can share your survey as a template to your friends happy enalyzing th august  employee feedback should it be anonymous well

right into it ok so before we start we need to recognize that employee feedback is vital for personal and professional growth think about it your employees spend a lot of time on the job according to happiness at work it’s about  hours… that’s a lot of hours understanding how they are doing and making sure to provide an environment where they can thrive ensures they grow as people and they engage in company goals and objectives with that settled it is now important for you to identify what systems and solutions to use in order to collect employee feedback there are different methods such as suggestion boxes feedback coaches and surveys you want to look for a combination of methods that are understood and accepted by your employees since this will get you as much feedback as possible but most importantly you need a system that ensures honest feedback which brings us to your original question… should employee feedback be anonymous we live in an age of sharing which means people are comfortable with sharing pictures of their pets opinions on movies and selfies upon selfies some people might even call this oversharing but at enalyzer we don’t judge – you do you nevertheless for some reason which most of us can relate to being open and honest with your boss still feels risky which is why anonymity is important there are many that disagree and believe that fostering a culture of honesty and openness is the best way to go since you can ask employees to expand on answers reach solutions together and award employees for constructive feedback this is all true but the most popular and effective tool to gather employee feedback is surveys and realistically speaking you will not get honest answers or any at all if you can’t guarantee anonymity anonymous surveys can help you get started in creating a culture of honesty and they are a powerful tool when used properly employees will share their true thoughts and suggestions when they don’t fear retaliation and by constantly acting upon the feedback you receive they will feel heard yes it’s one of those winwin situations we all love anonymity with enalyzer we are big advocates of anonymous employee surveys if you couldn’t already tell so we’ve designed a tool that ensures complete anonymity as with many other tools you can make your survey anonymous which means personal information on the respondents won’t be gathered or stored but anonymous surveys are more than that your respondents need to be confident that your survey will be conducted and processed in a manner that guarantees their absolute anonymity and this can be tricky with online surveys why is that well sharing a report based on a survey with a low level of responses can compromise your respondents’ anonymity – but we took care of that with enalyzer you can apply an anonymity level to your reports and charts which will hide data until that level is reached so if you set your level to  all those your share your charts and reports with will not be able to see the responses until more than  respondents have answered the survey wanna check it out create a free account th august  it’s all about first impressions the importance of survey design it takes people th of a second to form an opinion about a person and surveys are no different always… read more it takes people th of a second to form an opinion about a person and surveys are no different always keep in mind that surveys speak in two languages words and visuals so your survey’s first impression relies on these two complementing each other images colors and fonts we are sure you already know this but we’ll say it again – colors fonts and images are important plenty of studies shout out to internet phone mail and mixedmode surveys the tailored design method by don dillman jolene smyth and leah melani show that these incite feelings and attitudes on people which means you shouldn’t overlook the impact these can have on your respondents you can find endless research on colors fonts and images and we encourage you to do so however today we’re taking it a step further we want to focus on matching your survey’s visuals to its content avoid bias by conveying the same message through visuals and words make sure your visuals and text are saying the same thing if you have chosen a casual and informal tone in order to target a certain segment of respondents but your visuals are strict and rigid you’re creating cognitive dissonance and influencing your respondents’ performance for example if you conduct a survey on attitudes towards different social media platforms and you use facebook’s color scheme you will end up with invalid data your survey is part of your brand every and any interaction that customers have with your brand is defined as a touch point and it can have a positive or negative effect your survey is a touch point it’s part of your brand that’s why your survey design should align with your brand identity and be consistent we live in an online world which means customers experience brands throughout a variety of channels and it’s important to keep their experience consistent so if your website and social media are branded then your survey should reflect your company’s brand presence as well engage your audience through visuals you have chosen a specific tone and words to address a specific audience however have you chosen the right visuals for example let’s say you’re conducting a survey about homeschooling and include images of classrooms however your target audience is homeschooled children then these images are not going to resonate with them they might even hit the wrong note make sure your visuals align with your content and brand as well as speak directly to your target audience ultimately you can jeopardize your data by overlooking your survey’s visual design remember it is the first thing your respondents will notice and you don’t want to lose them before they even read the content of your survey visual design done well can increase response rates and minimize bias however when done poorly it can have the opposite effect enalyzer provides multiple survey design templates which can serve as a great starting point for your survey design – the possibilities are endless nd august  pareto principle in survey analysis and reports   the pareto principle aka the  rule is

found that  of the land in italy was owned by  of its people ok but why is it called a principle well he carried out surveys in other countries and found that the  distribution occurs frequently nowadays in business this principle is a common rule of thumb for example in general  of customers represent  of sales  of time spent produces  of results… you get the gist   if you apply the pareto principle to a bar chart the result will be values plotted in decreasing order of occurrence organized from left to right as a result the chart clearly illustrates which factors have the greatest impact and what problems need the most attention making them extremely useful in a variety of situations when to use the pareto principle in a chart when analyzing survey frequency data when there are many items and you want to focus on the most significant one when analyzing broad issues by looking at their specific components when sharing your survey data with others the pareto principle is

data from an audience you need to be respectful of their time and you want to make sure… read more when collecting data from an audience you need to be respectful of their time and you want to make sure your survey keeps the respondents engaged from “hello” to “thank you” a key aspect of keeping your respondents engaged is avoiding survey fatigue survey fatigue can be divided into two different types both of which can have a profound effect on your survey’s response rate as well as the quality of the data collected the first type of survey fatigue starts before your survey even begins and stems from the increased amount of surveys currently being circulated people are constantly being asked for feedback whether it be by the local grocery store or their workplace and are simply tired of answering surveys this type of survey fatigue is the hardest to battle as this is not really dependent on your specific survey but an overload of surveys in general the second type of survey fatigue is related to the fatigue your respondents may feel when actually taking a survey this type of fatigue happens if your survey is too long complicated or confusing and may lead to the respondents rushing through or exiting the survey prematurely leaving you with a lack of quality data  though the above might sound bleak don’t fret we have comprised a set of tips for how you can avoid your respondents getting survey fatigue don’t drown your audience in surveys don’t send more surveys than absolutely needed this way the chances are higher that your target audience will respond to the survey as opposed to if they have already received four surveys from you this month if your organization is dependent on sending out a lot of surveys try to keep track of when different departments are sending out surveys so the same people are not answering surveys from multiple departments at the same time communicate the survey’s value clearly if the respondents know how their responses will be used and what the aim of the survey is they are more inclined to stick through the survey so make sure to communicate this clearly when designing your survey reflect on and efficiently communicate the following to your respondents why should they take your survey what will the answers be used for how timeconsuming is the survey always think of your respondents though the survey might ultimately be beneficial for the respondents themselves through for example improved work or customer experience while taking the survey they are doing you a ‘favor’ by sacrificing their time this is not something that should be taken lightly so make sure that their time isn’t wasted which can be done by using behavior and conditions to make your survey as ‘respondentfriendly’ as possible this way you won’t confuse your respondents with irrelevant questions asking the right questions and not asking too many of them keep it simple and only ask the questions you absolutely need to short and sweet is the way to go put your survey to a ‘nice to know vs need to know’ test if questions in your survey are ‘nice to know’ rather than ‘need to know’ drop them this will give you better quality data and a higher response rate ensuring that you get the information that you ‘need to know’ get creative a good looking survey is inherently more pleasant to answer so put some effort into your survey design

shows they react quickly to problems making sure that  of tickets submitted to our help center are answered within an hour or less and it keeps getting better plus the enalyzer support rating has never been short of impressive check it our for yourselves that’s why today we’re happy to shed the spotlight on some of our key supporters so you can learn a little bit about the people at the other end of the line and what kind of work they do so what is a typical day at enalyzer support “it’s normally busy not only do we answer our customer’s calls and emails but we also constantly work together with all the other departments to ensure that every customer contacting enalyzer gets the correct information and gets in contact with the right enalyzer for example our consultants” – mille norway what do you like about working in support “i like to teach our customers more about enalyzer and tips on how to enalyze better or as we say become an enalyzer pro it is such a good feeling when you can maneuver and figure the tool out by yourself and i always aim at giving our customers this opportunity by teaching them i want them to get a better understanding of the tool not just get a quick but satisfying answer to their query i want to also enhance their overall understanding when they contact us so that next time they might understand the tool better and figure out things by themselves” marita norway “hearing a customer’s relief and happiness after talking to us especially if they have spent a lot of time and effort trying to solve the problem themselves is my favorite part of my job it never gets old” – mille norway what kind of queries do you usually get in support “we are focusing our support towards helping the customers get a full understanding of our tool this means that we can answer general questions about enalyzer and what the tool can do for the customers but also guide them in specific questions or problems that they have encountered within enalyzer apart from that we can help the customers with questions regarding their accounts” fredrik sweden “more concretely i find that the functions customer most often ask about are related to downloading their raw data file in order to see the data of each individual respondent as well as tips on report filters to get the best out of their insights” – ibi denmark what is your favorite story about an interaction with a customer “i can’t think of a favorite story but there has been plenty of occasions where you can save the customer a lot of time by giving them small tips and tricks that is always associated with a lot of excitement for example best practice tips in relation to conditions and jumps in the survey avoiding unnecessary questions to ensure a higher response rate and the variety of possibilities in reporting by using filters and data series” – marita norway “i had a customer who was launching a survey globally we started a good chat and she talked about the workload she had because of this massive survey however everything ended up with a big laugh and a happy customer after i showed her how easy it was to translate the survey she had initially thought that she had to create a survey per language that she was launching which were many many languages but was quite happy when she realized that she only had to create one and translate it” – fredrik sweden what advice would you give to new supporters “i think that the best advice to give to a new supporter would be that it gets easy after a while since we talk directly to our customers it can sometimes get nerveracking and it’s a lot of information in the beginning however after a while you do a lot of it on autopilot” – mille norway and finally as a new addition to the team can you share some of your experiences “being new in support is both challenging and rewarding we talked to many different customers every day each of them having individual and specific questions this can sometimes get overwhelming as we supporters need to efficiently handle and adapt to each customer request in a really short period of time however the gratitude and appreciation that customers have after getting guidance from us makes the whole process really gratifying” – cristina spain aren’t they great we think so but we know we’re biased that’s why we’ve compiled some testimonials from our customers so if you won’t take our word for it keep reading “mathilde thomsen returned our call and we got the best help high praise for mathilde who was quickly able to understand our challenges” – mia nørby region nordjylland “i think your support is great i always get fast answers and my problems solved” – malgorzata ligowskamarzeta danish health authority “fast and extremely friendly support this is really good” – ketil heyerdahl norsk journalistlag “i have only called enalyzer support a couple of times and i have always received quick and prompt help and answers to my questions super nice – good
