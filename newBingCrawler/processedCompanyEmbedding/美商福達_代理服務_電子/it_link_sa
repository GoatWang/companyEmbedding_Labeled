woocommerce  getting started   set up products adding and managing products adding a product ↑ back to top before adding your first product let’s get familiar with how product categories tags and attributes work product categories ↑ back to top product categories and tags work in much the same way as normal categories and tags you have when writing posts in wordpress they can be created edited and selected at any time this can be done when you first create a product or come back and edit it or the categorytag specifically attributes ↑ back to top these can be added per product or you can set up global attributes for the entire store to use eg in layered navigation to learn more see managing product categories tags and attributes product types ↑ back to top with attributes and categories set up and stock management configured we can begin adding products when adding a product the first thing to decide is what type of product it is simple – covers the vast majority of any products you may sell simple products are shipped and have no options for example a book grouped – a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only consist of simple products for example a set of six drinking glasses virtual – one that doesn’t require shipping for example a service enabling this disables all shipping related fields such as shipping dimensions a virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart and checkout downloadable – behaves like a virtual product meaning all shipping options are disabled furthermore it activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file after a successful purchase customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the order notification email this is suitable for example for a digital album pdf magazine or photo external or affiliate – one that you list and describe on your website but is sold elsewhere variable – a product with variations each of which may have a different sku price stock option etc for example a tshirt available in different colors andor sizes other types are often added by extensions for example woocommerce subscriptions adds new product types as does woocommerce bookings adding a simple product ↑ back to top adding a simple product is similar to writing a post in wordpress go to woocommerce  products  add product you then have a familiar interface and should immediately feel at home enter a product title and description go to the product data panel and select downloadable digital or virtual service if applicable note virtual products don’t require shipping — an order with virtual products won’t calculate shipping costs product data ↑ back to top the product data meta box is where the majority of important data is added for your products product data is added in this panel general section sku – stock keep unit sku tracks products must be unique and should be formatted so it does not match any post ids for example post ids are numbers so a sku could be ws that could stand for wooshirt  price regular price – item’s normalregular price sale price – item’s discounted price that can then be scheduled for certain date ranges inventory section the inventory section allows you to manage stock for the product individually and define whether to allow back orders and more if stock management is disabled from the settings page only the ‘manage stock’ option is visible ticking the sold individually checkbox limits the product to one per order shipping section weight – weight of the item dimensions – length width and height for the item shipping class – shipping classes are used by certain shipping methods to group similar products linked products section using upsells and crosssells you can cross promote your products they can be added by searching for a particular product and selecting the product from the dropdown list after adding they are listed in the input field upsells are displayed on the product details page these are products that you may wish to encourage users to upgrade based on the product they are currently viewing for example if the user is viewing the coffee product listing page you may want to display tea kettles on that same page as an upsell crosssells are products that are displayed with the cart and related to the user’s cart contents as an example if the user adds a nintendo ds to their cart you may want to suggest they purchase a spare stylus when they arrive at the cart page grouping – used to make a product part of a grouped product more info below at grouped products attributes section on the attributes tab you can assign details to a product you will see a select box containing global attribute sets you created eg platform more at managing product categories tags and attributes once you have chosen an attribute from the select box click add and apply the terms attached to that attribute eg nintendo ds to the product you can hide the attribute on the frontend by leaving the visible checkbox unticked custom attributes can also be applied by choosing custom product attribute from the select box these are added at the product level and won’t be available in layered navigation or other products advanced section purchase note – enter an optional note to send the customer after they purchase the product menu order – custom ordering position for this item enable reviews – enabledisable customers reviews for this item product short description ↑ back to top add an excerpt this typically appears next to product imagery on the listing page and the long description appears in the product description tab video embeds oembed may be used as of version x taxonomies ↑ back to top on the righthand side of the add new product panel there are product categories in which you can place your product similar to a standard wordpress post you can also assign product tags in the same way product images ↑ back to top you can add a main image and a gallery of images more at adding product image and galleries setting catalog visibility and feature status ↑ back to top in the publish panel you can set catalog visibility for your product catalog and search – visible everywhere shop pages category pages and search results catalog – visible in shop pages and category pages but not search results search – visible in search results but not in the shop page or category pages hidden – only visible on the single product page – not on any other pages adding a grouped product ↑ back to top a grouped product is created in much the same way as a simple product the only difference is you select grouped from the product type dropdown to create your parent product select ‘grouped’ from the product type dropdown create the grouped product ↑ back to top go to woocommerce  products  add new enter a title for the grouped product eg back to school set scroll down to product data and select grouped from the dropdown the price and several other fields disappear this is normal because a grouped product is a collection of ‘child products’ which is where you add this information publish the grouped product is still an empty group to this grouped product you need to create products and add them add existing child products having the choice to first create simple products and add them to a grouped product later or first create a grouped product and add simple products later gives you flexibility to add simple products to more than one grouped product add products to the group ↑ back to top go to woocommerce  products  add new select the grouped product you wish to add products to scroll down to product data and go to linked products select grouped products and search for the product by typing click the products you wish to add update adding a virtual product ↑ back to top when adding a simple product you can tick the virtual checkbox box in the product type panel with variable products this checkbox is moved to each variation enabling this disables all shipping related fields such as shipping dimensions a virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart and checkout adding a downloadable product ↑ back to top when adding a simple product you can tick the downloadable checkbox box in the product type panel this adds two new fields file path — path or url to your downloadable file download limit – limit on number of times the customer can download file left blank for unlimited downloads for maximum flexibility downloadable products also incur a shipping cost if for example you were offering both a packaged and a downloadable version of a product this would be ideal you can also check the virtual box if the downloadable product is not shippable note if the completed order email doesn’t contain downloadable links see this troubleshooting guide adding an externalaffiliate product ↑ back to top select ‘externalaffiliate’ from the product type dropdown this removes unnecessary tabs such as tax and inventory and inserts a new product url field this is the destination where users can purchase the product rather than add to cart buttons they see a read more button directing them to this url adding a variable product ↑ back to top variable products are arguably the most complex of product types they let you define variations of a single product where each variation may have a different sku price or stock level see variable product for a guide on creating a product with variations duplicating a product ↑ back to top to save time it’s possible to use a product and duplicate it to create similar products with variations and other qualities go to woocommerce  products and look through the list for a product you wish to replicate then click duplicate deleting a product ↑ back to top to delete a product go to woocommerce  products find the product you wish to delete hover in the area under the product name and click trash mark a product as featured ↑ back to top to mark a product as featured go to products  products and select the star in the featured column alternatively select quick edit and then the featured option setting a featured product product id ↑ back to top a woocommerce product id is sometimes needed when using shortcodes widgets and links to find the id go to products and hover over the product you need the id for the product id number is displayed     allow backorders ↑ back to top select whether to allow or not allow backorders from the dropdown if you are managing stock on a product use advanced notifications separate purchase to help notify someone other than the shop admin if backorders are placed most payment gateways charge immediately if you want to wait to charge customers for an item until the item is back in stock you can use the woocommerce waitlist separate extension to email all users notifying them that the item is back in stock with a link to purchase it faq ↑ back to top is it possible to edit
