israelis invested  billion in us incomeproducing properties over past  months share on facebook share on twitter green house  photo creditcourtesy a skyscraper here a shopping center there one acre after another – the israelis are again buying us real estate a survey by bregman baraz real estate commissioned by globes found that israelis were the secondlargest foreign buyers of us incomeproducing real estate in the period from july  to june  after canadiansforeign investment accounted for  percent of total investment in us incomeproducing real estate in this period with israelis accounting for onetenth of the foreign investment or  of total investment in the sector be the first to know  join our facebook page israelis invested  billion to buy  incomeproducing properties in the united states over the past  months that put them ahead of the swiss who invested b and second only to canadians who spent b total foreign investment was bisrael with a gross domestic product that is  of the us’s accounts for just a sliver of foreign direct investment in the us outside real estate to put it another way israel is a small country with a large shadow – proportionally a very large shadow – in the us incomeproducing realestate marketisraelis are not the only buyers of us incomeproducing real estateaccording to real capital analytics which bregman baraz real estate represents in israel transactions in the sector more than doubled in the first half of  over the first half of  – the largest growth in any country except for singapore the volume of the global incomeproducing realestate market rose  to b in the first half mostly due to the increase in transactions in the us asian and european markets except for germany were flatforeign investment in the us rose  in the first half of the year compared with the corresponding period last year according to bregman baraz real estate partner daniel baraz the biggest investors which he defines as investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the past three months are ubs ag and canadian companies and realestate investment trusts reits including artis reit and westmont hospitality group incwhile no israelis made the grade in the second quarter they did in april  when nochi dankner bought the us headquarters of hsbc in manhattan for  million through idb holding corp ltd units property and building ltd and koor industries ltdharel insurance investments and financial services ltd realestate investments manager gadi ben haim said “there is no doubt that it’s better to buy in manhattan than in remote locations but the current  percent return there is illogical and much lower than a year ago although there are still opportunitieswe bought property in boston because it’s a large metropolis of  million people we try to focus on key markets because they are less risky we won’t go to tier  towns of  residents but to locations with liquid properties”a breakdown by subsector shows that office towers and shopping centers attracted the most investment  and  respectivelyalmost all of the balance was invested in residential properties especially rental projects but also in homes for sale in practice however the proportion of residential real estate is larger because transactions also involve additional investment in renovations for rent or resalethere were several large deals by israelis in july june harel bought several properties for m it was followed by migdal insurance and financial holdings ltd and menorah mivtachim holdings ltd which jointly invested m to buy a property in manhattanazrieli group ltd bought a houston office building for m with a return on investment of almost  big shopping centers  ltd made a number of small purchases for mthrough its joint reit venture with kimco realty corporationproperty and building which bought barney’s new york flagship store in chicago for m in january bought another chicago building in midjuly not included in this survey for mother acquisitions include a chicago building by ziel feldman acro real estate ltd and property and building and several manhattan properties and lots by fishman holdings units industrial buildings corp and darban investments ltdfor more than m not including construction costs“for investment institutions with a high home bias heading abroad with proper expertise and caution could help diversify their investment portfolios” bregman baraz real estate partner nilit bregman saidmost of the large transactions were made through joint ventures between foreign investors and local partners familiar with the market – a common practice in the industry“two aspects come into play” baraz said “one aspect is to spread the risk but on the other hand there is increased risk due to the limited control or even absence of control of a property which can cause problems if conditions change in the market or in one of the partners”the possibility of disputes between partners is not a theoretical issue and the survey for the past  months found one the liquidated partnership between lev leviev and shaya boymelgreen in january optibase ltd unit optibase real estate miami llc bought  condominiums in miami from leviev boymelgreen marquis developers llc for mlevievcontrolled africaisrael investments ltd has been selling properties in manhattan at a loss after they were purchased at the peak of the market and they are not the only ones real estate is not a oneway ticket to financial successthere is no question that israelis have again fallen in love with manhattanalmost  of the deals in dollar terms in the past year were in manhattan and  were in the metropolitan new york area the figure only refers to large deals and there were probably many small ones as wellninety percent of residential transactions in the first half of  totaling m were in manhattanthe rest were in south floridatotal deals in manhattan in the first half were bisraelis’ absence from washington dc stands out as it attracted onethird of foreign investors in us real estate in the first half of the yearisraelis look farther afield when it comes to nonresidential real estatehouston tops the list accounting for  of israelis’ investment in office space in the us in the first half thanks to two purchases by harel and azrieliin contrast to residential and office property the name of the game in commercial real estate is dispersal a review of israelis’ investments stretches across the us for example aviv arlon global ltdbought a shopping center outside indianapolis big shopping centers and kimco bought properties throughout california and dizengoff group ltd bought properties in south floridathe bregman baraz real estate survey only included transactions larger than m made in the second half of  and the first half of  the data was provided by real capital analytics the survey did not include transactions made by us subsidiaries of israeli
