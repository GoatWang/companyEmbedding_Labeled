derivative  wikipedia derivative from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the term as used in calculus for a less technical overview of the subject see differential calculus for other uses see derivative disambiguation the graph of a function drawn in black and a tangent line to that function drawn in red the slope of the tangent line is equal to the

the derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function output value with respect to a change in its argument input value derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus for example the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the objects velocity this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances the derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value when it exists is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point the tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value for this reason the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables in this generalization the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is after an appropriate translation the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function the jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables it can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables for a realvalued function of several variables the jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector the process of finding a derivative is called differentiation the reverse process is called antidifferentiation the fundamental theorem of calculus states that antidifferentiation is the same as integration differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in singlevariable calculusnote

rate at which the value y of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable x it is called the derivative of f with respect to x if x and y are real numbers and if the graph of f is plotted against x the derivative is the slope of this graph at each point slope of a linear function m  δ y δ x  where fa is identified with a constant function xi − ai are the components of the vector x − a and dfi and dfjk are the components of df and df as linear transformations generalizationsedit main article derivative generalizations the concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings the common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a linear approximation of the function at that point an important generalization of the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables such as functions from a domain in the complex numbers c to c the notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition if c is identified with r by writing a complex number z as x  i y then a differentiable function from c to c is certainly differentiable as a function from r to r in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist but the converse is not true in general the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the cauchy–riemann equations – see holomorphic functions another generalization concerns functions between differentiable or smooth manifolds intuitively speaking such a manifold m is a space that can be approximated near each point x by a vector space called its tangent space the prototypical example is a smooth surface in r the derivative or differential of a differentiable map f m → n between manifolds at a point x in m is then a linear map from the tangent space of m at x to the tangent space of n at fx the derivative function becomes a map between the tangent bundles of m and n this definition is fundamental in differential geometry and has many uses – see pushforward differential and pullback differential geometry differentiation can also be defined for maps between infinite dimensional vector spaces such as banach spaces and fréchet spaces there is a generalization both of the directional derivative called the gâteaux derivative and of the differential called the fréchet derivative one deficiency of the classical derivative is that not very many functions are differentiable nevertheless there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all continuous functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the weak derivative the idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of distributions and only require that a function is differentiable on average the properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology — see for example differential algebra the discrete equivalent of differentiation is finite differences the study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in time scale calculus also see arithmetic derivative historyedit main article history of calculus see alsoedit mathematics portal applications of derivatives automatic

as discussed in this article is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources see apostol  apostol  and spivak   despite this it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of distributions the result is nine times the dirac measure centered at acitation needed  in the formulation of calculus in terms of limits the du symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors some authors do not assign a meaning to du by itself but only as part of the symbol dudx others define dx as an independent variable and define du by du  dx⋅f′x in nonstandard analysis du is defined as an infinitesimal it is also interpreted as the exterior derivative of a function u see differential infinitesimal for further information  this can also be expressed as the adjointness between the product space and function space constructionscitation needed referencesedit  spivak  chapter   banach s  uber die bairesche kategorie gewisser
