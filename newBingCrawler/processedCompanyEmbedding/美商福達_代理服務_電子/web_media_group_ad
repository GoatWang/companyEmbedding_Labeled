emphasizing the products availability through saturation campaigns he also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores stating in  that tastes change fashions change and the advertiser has to change with them an idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat stale and unprofitable if presented to the public today not that the idea of

bachelor master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasiscitation needed a surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes such as the advance of online social networkingcitation needed a unique model for teaching advertising is the studentrun advertising agency where advertising students create campaigns for real companies organizations such as the american advertising federation establish companies with students to create these campaignscitation needed purposesedit advertising is at the

the company point out and create a need for products or services demonstrate new uses for established products announce new products and programs reinforce the salespeoples individual messages draw

pollution london  while advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth it is not without social costs unsolicited commercial email and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers advertising is increasingly invading public spaces such as schools which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation one of the most controversial criticisms of advertisement in the present day is that of the predominance of advertising of foods high in sugar fat and salt specifically to children critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices additionally children may not understand that they are being sold something and are therefore more impressionablebetter source needed michelle obama has criticized large food companies for advertising unhealthy foods largely towards children and has requested that food companies either limit their advertising to children or advertise foods that are more in line with dietary guidelines the other criticisms include the change that are brought by those advertisements on the society and also the deceiving ads that are aired and published by the corporations cosmetic and health industry are the ones which exploited the highest and created reasons of concern regulationedit there have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising some examples include restrictions for advertising alcohol tobacco or gambling imposed in many countries as well as the bans around advertising to children which exist in parts of europe advertising regulation focuses heavily on the veracity of the claims and as such there are often tighter restrictions placed around advertisements for food and healthcare products the advertising industries within some countries rely less on laws and more on systems of selfregulation advertisers and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold the general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is legal decent honest and truthful some selfregulatory organizations are funded by the industry but remain independent with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the advertising standards authority in the uk in the uk most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the uk town and county planning system currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the planning authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £ per offense in the us many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm as long ago as the s in the us there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside cities such as são paulo have introduced an outright ban with london also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays some governments restrict the languages that can be used in advertisements but advertisers may employ tricks to try avoiding them in france for instance advertisers sometimes print english words in bold and french translations in fine print to deal with article  of the  toubon law limiting the use of english the advertising of pricing information is another topic of concern for governments in the united states for instance it is common for businesses to only mention the existence and amount of applicable taxes at a later stage of a transaction in canada and new zealand taxes can be listed as separate items as long as they are quoted upfront in most other countries the advertised price must include all applicable taxes enabling customers to easily know how much it will cost them theoryedit see also advertising management hierarchyofeffects modelsedit various competing models of hierarchies of effects attempt to provide a theoretical underpinning to advertising practiceclarification needed the model of clow and baack clarifies the objectives of an advertising campaign and for each individual advertisement the model postulates six steps a buyer moves through when making a purchase awareness knowledge liking preference conviction purchase meansend theory suggests that an advertisement should contain a message or means that leads the consumer to a desired endstate leverage points aim to move the consumer from understanding a products benefits to linking those benefits with personal valuescitation needed marketing mixedit this section may stray from the topic of the article please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page january  main article marketing mix the marketing mix was proposed by professor e jerome mccarthy in the s it consists of four basic elements called the four ps product is the first p representing the actual product price represents the process of determining the value of a product place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer such as distribution channels market coverage and movement organization the last p stands for promotion which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to buy the product in the s the concept of four cs was introduced as a more customerdriven replacement of four ps there are two theories based on four cs lauterborns four cs consumer cost communication convenience  and shimizus four cs commodity cost communication channel in the cs compass model comarketing communications can include advertising sales promotion public relations publicity personal selling corporate identity internal communication sns mis advertising researchedit main article advertising research advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising it entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies advertising research includes pretesting also known as copy testing and posttesting of ads andor campaigns pretesting includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques including focus groups indepth target audience interviews oneonone interviews smallscale quantitative studies and physiological measurement the goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals posttesting employs many of the same techniques as pretesting usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement with the emergence of digital advertising technologies many firms have begun to continuously posttest ads using realtime data this may take the form of ab splittesting or multivariate testing continuous ad tracking and the communicus system are competing examples of posttesting advertising research types semioticsedit main article advertising research meanings between consumers and marketers depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday objectsneed quotation to verify semiotics is the study of signs and how they are interpreted advertising has many hidden signs and meaningscitation needed within brand names logos package designs print advertisements and television advertisements semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in for example advertisements logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels – known as the surface level and the underlying level the surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a productcitation needed these signs can be images words fonts colors or slogans the underlying level is made up of hidden meanings the combination of images words colors and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer the key to advertising analysis is the signifier and the signified the signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept a product has a signifier and a signified the signifier is the color brand name logo design and technology the signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative the denotative meaning is the meaning of the product a televisions denotative meaning might be that it is high definition the connotative meaning is the products deep and hidden meaning a connotative meaning of a television would be that it is topoftheline apples commercialswhen used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of apples target market they placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing however the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white ipod through white headphones through advertising the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an ipod the white color signifies almost all of apples products the semiotics of gender plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted when considering gender roles in advertising individuals are influenced by three categories certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message if the product is perceived as feminine or masculine second the characteristics of individuals can affect attention and elaboration of the message traditional or nontraditional gender role orientation lastly situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message there are two types of marketing communication claimsobjective and subjective objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature for instance a camera may have autofocus features subjective claims convey emotional subjective impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service they are nonphysical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived as they have no physical reality for instance the brochure has a beautiful design males tend to respond better to objective marketingcommunications claims while females tend to respond better to subjective marketing communications claims voiceovers are commonly used in advertising most voiceovers are done by men with figures of up to  having been reported there have been more female voiceovers in recent yearswhen but mainly for food household products and femininecare products gender effects in the processing of advertisingedit according to a  study by david statt females process information comprehensively while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures methods or strategies for solving problems which could have an effect on how they interpret advertisingneed quotation to verify according to this study men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message whereas females engage in more creative associative imagerylaced interpretation later research by a danish team found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance whereas its approach to women aims at transformation toward an impossible ideal of female presentationin paul suggetts article the objectification of women in advertising he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements who are too perfect to be real have on women in real life and gives men and young men a skewed and unrealistic expectation of women advertisings manipulation of womens aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film in erotic art in advertising on stage within music videos and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearancesthese advertisements are directed towards men not everyone agrees one critic viewed this monologic genderspecific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicizedneed quotation to verify there are some companies however like dove and aerie that are creating commercials to portray more natural women that are less photo shopped so more women and young girls are able to relate to them these commercials give more natural beauty standards more recent research by martin  reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads and on the affective tone of the advertising when feeling sad males prefer happy ads to boost their mood in contrast females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy the television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewers mood state susan wojcicki author of the article ads that empower women don’t just break stereotypes—they’re also effective discusses how advertising to women has changed since the first barbie commercial where a little girl tells the doll that she wants to be just like her little girls grow up watching advertisements of scantily clad women advertising things from trucks to burgers and wojcicki states it shows girls that theyre either arm candy or eye candy but in recent studies ads that are shown empowering women such as the like a girl ad campaign by always have a better effect on women when women see women being empowered on these ads theyre more likely to watch and share the videos the views of these ads on sites like youtube doubled and are more likely to be watched and shared by women see

advertising agencies advertising marketing and property management all types of business need advertising and marketing assistance to help generate awareness interest and ultimately profit obviously the internet has changed the landscape of advertising by adding another media form the presence of which appears to be everywhere property management case study the way we use the internet has changed and the way google—by far the most dominant search engine—leads us to web pages has also changed with that in mind we’ve decided to create a case study in the property management vertical just how much does domain name matter are links really all that important what about content what about tlds toplevel domains so starting from ground zero we’re setting out to determine what matters when you’re trying to get a website business up and running why property management we chose this vertical partly because we have experience in the field of lead generation for property management companies so we’re familiar with the players the content required and business issues we also chose it because it’s an appropriate midsized market an important question for us is how quickly can we get a website up running and generating leads using minimal time and money with that in mind we’ve selected ten domain names with varying tlds of the ten six have org tlds five of the domains contain a “geo” for major us cities on the assumption that you are more likely to rank higher using a term because they filter out competition from irrelevant locations these domains are portland propertymanagementportlandorg houston propertymanagementhoustonorg atlanta propertymanagementatlantaorg chicago chicagopropertymanagementorg and san diego sandiegopropertymanagementorg and one org domain is a general domain propertymanagmentcompaniesorg the remaining four domains are a bit of an experiment using the co management and net tlds they also contain a “geo” designation for a major us city denver propertymanagementdenvernet utah propertymanagementutahorg tucson tucsonpropertymanagement and orlando propertymanagementorlandoco stay tuned as we explore the most efficient and cost effective ways to get traffic to websites advertising media planning a primer  introduction the two basic tasks of marketing communications are message creation and message dissemination media planning supports message dissemination media planning helps you determine which media to usebe it television programs newspapers busstop posters instore displays banner ads on the web or a flyer on facebook it also tells you when and where to use media in order to reach your desired audience simply put media planning refers to the process of selecting media time and space to disseminate advertising messages in order to accomplish marketing objectives when advertisers run commercials during the super bowl game at more than  million per thirtysecond spot for example media planners are involved in the negotiation and placement media planners often see their role from a brand contact perspective instead of focusing solely on what medium is used for message dissemination media planners also pay attention to how to create and manage brand contact brand contact is any planned and unplanned form of exposure to and interaction with a product or service for example when you see an ad for volkswagen on tv hear a mazdas zoom zoom slogan on the radio are told by a friend that her ipod is the greatest invention or sample a a new flavor of piranha energy drink at the grocery store you are having a brand contact television commercials radio ads and product sampling are planned forms of brand contact word of mouth is an unplanned brand contact  advertisers normally do not plan for word of mouth from the consumers perspective however unplanned forms of brand contact may be more influential because they are less suspicious compared to advertising the brand contact perspective shows how the role of media planners has expanded first media planners have moved from focusing only on traditional media to integrating traditional media and new media new media  cable and satellite television satellite radio businesstobusiness emedia consumer internet movie screen advertising and videogame advertising  is playing an increasingly significant role spending on new advertising media is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of  percent from  reaching  billion by  while traditional media advertising is expected to rise only  percent on a compound annual basis during the same period to  billion second media planners are making more use of product placements now in lieu of advertising insertions advertising insertions like print ads or television commercials are made separately from the content and are inserted into it the ads are distinct from the articles or tv programs not a part of them as a result the ads seem intrusive in contrast product placement also called brand placement or branded entertainment blends product information with the content itself whether content is a television program movie video game or other form of entertainment product placement puts the brand message into the entertainment content for example in the movie et the extraterrestrial eats reeses pieces candy the candy was authentically integrated into the movie and sales of reeses pieces soared  after the movie catapulting the new product to mainstream status on the other hand inappropriate or excessive product placements may do more harm than good to the brand finally the role of media planners has expanded as media planners have moved beyond planned messages to take advantage of unplanned messages as well whereas planned messages are what advertisers initiate  like an ad press release or sales promotion  unplanned messages are often initiated by people and organizations other than advertisers themselves word of mouth both online and offline is one form of unplanned message although advertisers have little direct control over the flow of unplanned messages they can facilitate such a flow for example advertising agency crispin porter  bogusky cpb created a viral marketing mascot the subservient chicken for burger king to illustrate its slogan have it your way visitors to the wwwsubservientchickencom site can ask the chicken to make a move such as jump dance or lay an egg in the first two weeks after the sites launch the subservient chicken story appeared on  broadcast segments including five separate segments in television shows unplanned success within months the site had generated  million hits from  million unique visitors averaging six minutes per session many visitors learned about the site through word of mouth both online and offline more recently specialized agencies have started to hire word of mouth agents to work for advertisers on a fee basis initial research suggests that many consumers react positively to this kind of word of mouth communication for example rock bottom brew pub chain reported a  jump in  revenues after hired gun bzzagent launched a week word of mouth campaign employing  of its agents to get the word out these new approaches have altered how media planning works in the advertising process seven years ago media was the last five minutes of the presentation now its reversed said rishad tobaccowala of publicis groupe media whose fastgrowing starcom division helps clients buy and measure interactive mobile and gaming ads media planners are playing an increasingly important role in todays advertising industry because of the continuing proliferation of new media options and the increased complexity of media and audience research  media objectives how is a media plan developed media planning is a fourstep process which consists of  setting media objectives in light of marketing and advertising objectives  developing a media strategy for implementing media objectives  designing media tactics for realizing media strategy and  proposing procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the media plan            lets take a look at the planning process through an example pgs launch of the gillette fusion shaving system for men in early  first pgs media objectives called for a  million media blitz to reach men in the us second pgs strategy included a mix of national media to introduce the brands for example television advertising such as a  million super bowl ad campaign portrayed fusion as an advanced technology found in a secret government ufo lab the tv ads also established the brands signature orange and blue color scheme in store aisles  display units promoted fusion using the brands colors to catch consumers attention were trying to put the product wherever men shop said pauline munroe marketing director for blades and razors in pgs gillette business unit third pgs media tactics  such as a fathers day sweepstakes an episode of nbcs the apprentice in which the shows teams competed to promote the razor and sponsorship of competitive surfing  helped the company reach men of all ages fusion will get so much attention that it will drive a lot of men to try these grooming products said gary stibel of new england consulting group finally pg used sales and market share targets to assess the effectiveness of the media plan pg expects sales of fusion to reach  billion in sales by year three pg knows that the brand has already achieved  market share in the us thus although  million seems like a lot to spend on advertising a new product it represents a sound financial investment toward the tremendous future profit that pg will gain from the new shaving system now lets take a deeper look into the media planning process media planning such as planning the marketing communications for the launch of the fusion new shaving system starts with setting media objectives media objectives usually consist of two key components target audience and communication goals the target audience component of the media objectives defines who is the intended target of the campaign for example pgs target audience objective for its fusion shaving system was men  years old the communications goals component of the media objectives defines how many of the audience the campaign intends to reach and how many times it will reach them in short media objectives are a series of statements that specify what exactly the media plan intends to accomplish the objectives represent the most important goals of brand message dissemination and they are the concrete steps to accomplish marketing objectives the next two sections  and  provide details on target audience and communication goals youll learn about sources of data to use to identify your target audience youll also learn how to quantify communication plans  target audience the first objective of a media plan is to select the target audience the people whom the media plan attempts to influence through various forms of brand contact because media objectives are subordinate to marketing and advertising objectives it is essential to understand how the target audience is defined in the marketing and advertising objectives the definition may or may not be exactly the same depending on the marketing and advertising objectives and strategies a common marketing objective is to increase sales by a specific amount but this marketing objective does not specify a target audience which is why the media objective is needed  consider kelloggs corn flakes and all the different strategies the advertiser could use to increase sales among different target audiences for example one target audience might be current customers  encouraging people who eat one bowl a day to also munch the cereal as a snack or the advertiser might target competitors customers encouraging them to switch brands or the advertiser might target young adults who are shifting from high sugar kids cereals to more adult breakfast fare finally the advertiser could target a broader lowerincome demographic the point is that each campaign could increase sales via a different target audience marketers analyze the market situation to identify the potential avenues for boosting sales increase and consider how advertising might achieve those aims if the advertiser chooses to attract competitors customers  like what sprint does to attract users of other wireless services  the media plan will need to define the target audience to be brand switchers and will then identify reasons to give those potential switchers to switch such as greater convenience lower cost or additional plan features for example in  sprint nextel ran an ad campaign urging consumers to switch to sprint because no one has a more powerful network  demographics and psychographics the target audience is often defined in terms of demographics and psychographics syndicated research services such as simmons market research bureau smrb or simmons and mediamark research inc mri provide national data on a number of demographics of us consumers including gender age education household income marital status employment status type of residence and number of children in the household using demographic variables for example the target audience of a media plan could be individuals who are to years old with yearly household income of  or more or all households with children age  years or younger some advertisers believe that demographic definitions of a target audience are too ambiguous because individual consumers that fit such definitions can be quite different in terms of their brand preference and purchase behavior for example think about the students in a media planning class even though some of them are the same age and gender they may like different brands of toothpaste shampoo cereal clothing and other products therefore media planners use psychographics to refine the definition of the target audience psychographics is a generic term for consumers personality traits serious funny conservative beliefs and attitudes about social issues opinions about abortion environment globalization personal interests music sports movie going and shopping orientations recreational shoppers pricesensitive shoppers convenience shoppers mazda for example doesnt define its target audience by age income or gender but by psychographic principles mazda targets people who have a need for selfexpression are young at heart and love to drive one psychographic system which media planners often use is called vals short for values and lifestyles which was developed by sri in the s vals places us adult consumers into one of eight segments based on their responses to the vals questionnaire the eight segments are innovators thinkers achievers experiencers believers strivers makers and survivors each segment has a unique set of psychological characteristics for example innovators are successful sophisticated takecharge people with high selfesteem because they have such abundant resources they exhibit all three primary motivations in varying degrees they are change leaders and are the most receptive to new ideas and technologies innovators are very active consumers and their purchases reflect cultivated tastes for upscale niche products and services defining a target audience by psychographic variables helps not only creative directors with the development of advertising appeals but also media planners with the selection of effective media channels if a psychographic group of consumers likes playing golf for example they are likely to read golfrelated magazines and visit golfrelated web sites  generational cohorts in addition to demographics and psychographics generational cohort is another useful concept for selecting the target audience because the members of a particular generational cohort are likely to have had similar experiences during their formative years they maintain analogous social views attitudes and values generational cohorts in the us are the baby boomers about  million people born  generation x about  million people born in  and generation y about  million people born between  and  each of the cohorts possesses distinct characteristics in their lifestyles and often serves as a reference group from which finer segments of the target audiences can be selected for specific advertising campaigns an interesting example of a generational cohort is kogals in japan originating from the world for high school kogals are a unique segment of young women in urban japan who conspicuously display their disposable incomes through unique tastes in fashion music and social activity they have the leisure time to invent new ways of using electronic gadgets for example they started changing mobile phones ring tones from boring beeps to various popular songs and changing screen savers from dull defaults to cute pictures manufacturers observe kogals and listen to what they say is unsatisfactory about the products in some cases manufacturers simply imitate the new usages that kogals spontaneously invented and incorporate these usages part of their own new commercial services thereby increasing sales  product and brand usage target audiences can also be more precisely defined by their consumption behavior product usage includes both brand usage the use of a specific brand such as special k cereal or dove soap and category usage the use of a product category such as facial tissue or chewing gum product use commonly has four levels heavy users medium users light users and nonusers the levels of use depend on the type of product for example simmons defines heavy domestic beer users as those who consume five or more cans in the past  days medium beer users as those who consumer two to four cans and light users as those who consume one can in  days for travel simmons definitions are three foreign trips per year indicate heavy travel users  foreign trips per year are medium travel users and  trip per year are light travel users there is a popular saying in the industry the twenty percent who are heavy users account for eighty percent of the sales of a product this highlights the importance of heavy users for a brands performance examples of defining a target audience by product usage can be individuals who dine out at least four times in a month or individuals who made domestic trips twice or more last year similarly brand usage has several categories brand loyals are those who use the same brand all the time primary users use a brand most of the time but occasionally also use other brands in the same category they are secondary users for these competing brands brand switchers are those who have no brand preference for a given product category but choose a brand on the basis of situational factors an analysis of the brand usage pattern is helpful for the identification of the appropriate target audience simmons  and mri  offer brand usage data for many national brands  primary and secondary target audience the target audience in a media plan can be either primary or secondary a primary target audience is one that plays a major role in purchase decisions while a secondary target audience plays a less decisive role in the case of video game players for example childrens requests often initiate a purchase process parents often respect their childrens brand selection thus it is reasonable to consider children as the primary target audience and their parents as the secondary target audience if the parents are aware of the advertised brand it will be easier for children to convince them of the purchase media planners need to examine and identify the role of consumers in shopping buying and consuming a product or service to target the right groups of consumers effectively  the size of target audiences in the process of defining a target audience media planners often examine and specify the actual size of a target audience  how many people or households fit the definition knowing the actual size helps advertisers to estimate the potential buying power of the target audience for example if the target audience of a campaign is defined as working women to years old who are interested in receiving daily news updates on their mobile phones media planners should estimate the number of these women in the us to quantify the sales potential as another example if the target audience consists of  households in the us and each household purchases the brand two times a month the monthly sales would be  units the us census bureau  provides the most authoritative data about demographics of the us population by state whereas the us census provides demographic data market research services such as simmons and mri provide demographic data that is linked to product data this means that media planners can get information about consumers of hundreds of product types  communication goals after media planners define the target audience for a media plan they set communication goals to what degree the target audience must be exposed to and interact with brand messages in order to achieve advertising and marketing objectives for example one communication goal can be that  percent of the target audience will see the brand in television commercials at least once during a period of three months another communication goal is that  percent of the target audience will form a preference for a new brand in the first month of the brand launch the different communication goals can be better understood in a hierarchy of advertising objectives such as bill harveys expansion of an earlier model of advertising research foundation arf the expanded arf model has ten levels as shown in figure  the first three levels of goals from the bottom  vehicle distribution vehicle exposure and advertising exposure  are particularly relevant for media planning vehicle distribution refers to the coverage of a media vehicle such as the number of copies that a magazine or newspaper issue has or the number of households that can tune in to a given television channel vehicle exposure refers to the number of individuals exposed to the media vehicle such as the number of people who read a magazine or watched a television program advertising exposure refers to the number of individuals exposed an ad or a commercial itself it is important to note the difference between vehicle exposure and advertising exposure for many media with editorial content for example not all audience members of a television program will watch all the commercials interspersed in the program a study shows that only  percent of television audiences watch the commercials in television programs vehicle exposure represents only an opportunity to see an ad not necessarily that the ad has actually been seen in reality advertising exposure is rarely measured and media planners use vehicle exposure as a proxy measure of advertising exposure another group of communication goals is advertising recall advertising persuasion leads and sales advertising recall represents the cognitive effect of the ad advertising persuasion represents the emotional effect of the ad and leads and sales are the behavioral effects of the ad each can be specified in a media plan as a communication goal for example a communication goal can specify that  of the target audience will recall the radio ad during the month of the campaign or that a campaign will generate  leads figure  arf model expanded for interactive  reach frequency and gross rating points media planners often define the communication goals of a media plan using the three interrelated concepts of reach gross rating points and frequency media planners use reach to set their objective for the total number of people exposed to the media plan reach is one of the most important terms in media planning and has three characteristics first reach is a percentage although the percentage sign is rarely used when reach is stated media planners are aware of the size of the target audience for example if a media plan targets the roughly  million of women who are  years old then a reach of  means that  or  million of the target audience will exposed to some of the media vehicles in the media plan second reach measures the accumulation of audience over time because reach is always defined for a certain period of time the number of audience members exposed to the media vehicles in a media plan increases over time for example reach may grow from   in the first week to   in the fourth week the pattern of audience accumulation varies depending on the media vehicles in the media plan third reach doesnt doublecount people exposed multiple times if the media plan involves repeated ads in one media category or ads in multiple media categories media planners use reach because it represents that total number of people exposed to the marketing communication besides reach media planners use gross rating points as a shorthand measure of the total amount of exposure they want to buy from media outlets such as tv networks for example the  super bowl game received a rating of  which means  percent of us television households tuned in to the program if an advertiser planned to run a commercial once during the super bowl that ad would appear in  of households if the commercial was run only once the reach is equal to the rating of the program a grp of  if the advertisers media plan called for running the ad twice during the super bowl the grp would be    media planners often think in terms of gross rating points because ad prices often scale with this measure as a rule of thumb it costs about twice as much to obtain a grp of  as to obtain a grp of  a media plan that calls for a grp of  doesnt necessarily mean that the advertiser must advertise twice on the super bowl the advertiser could also buy  spots on popular primetime shows that each have a rating of     or buy a large number of spots say  spots on a range of nichemarket cable tv programs radio stations or magazines that have a rating of  some media vehicles are bestsuited to specific target audiences for example the nickelodeon tv channel controls  of kids grps notice the difference between grp and reach grp counts total exposures while reach counts unique people exposed thus grp does doublecount people who see ads multiple times frequency connects the concept of reach with that of grp to see this relationship between grp and reach lets consider what happens when an advertiser puts two spots on the super bowl  one during the first half of the game and another in the second half as mentioned earlier this example plan has a grp of  but what is the reach that depends on how many people watch both halves of the game rating services such as ac nielsen monitor who watches the game when they watch and whether they watch the first half or the second half or both halves of the game these rating services know that for example  of the gamewatching households stop watching after the first half and  of gamewatching households start watching during the second half this means that although  of households are tuned in to the game during each half its not the same  for both halves thus the reach of the first ad is  but then onethird of these households    of all households tune out before the second ad during the second half this means that only  of all households watch both first and second halves of the game and see the ad twice this  of households who are still watching when the second spot shows wont add to the reach when they see the second spot during the second half a different  of us households tune in these new watchers do count toward the reach during the second half because they didnt see the ad during the first half thus the total reach for the game for the twoad plan is    frequency is the ratio of grp over reach frequency is a measure of repetition the formula of calculating frequency is             frequency  gross rating points  reach using the super bowl example again if the grps were  and the reach was  then the frequency would then be   a frequency of  would mean that on average audience members of the super bowl game had oneandahalf opportunities to watch the ad the media objectives of a media plan often call for some combination of reach and frequency media planners want the highest reach possible because that means more people will be exposed to the campaign which should lead to more brand awareness customer loyalty sales and so on media planners also seek high frequency if they feel that consumers will only take action that is buy the product after multiple exposures to the campaign for example launching a new brand or teaching consumers about the features of a product like the features of a fivebladed shaving system may take several impressions thus reach indicates the media dispersion while frequency shows the media repetition notice that the formula for frequency can be flipped to make a formula for grps grps are the product of reach multiplied by frequency if a media plan calls for a broad reach and a high frequency then it calls for very high grps lots of ad exposures to lots of people achieving a very high grp is very expensive however and budget issues may preclude such a high grp thus media planners may start with budget then estimate the grps that they can afford and then either sacrifice reach to maintain frequency or let frequency drop to one in order to maximize reach  frequency distribution effective frequency and effective reach media planners also consider frequency distribution in order to fully understand exactly how many exposures different people experience that is how many people will see the ad once twice three times etc this lets the planner estimate the effective reach of the plan at the effective frequency needed by the campaign the number of people who see the ads a sufficient number of times for the media plan to be effective effective frequency refers to the minimum number of media exposures for a communication goal to be achieved while effective reach is the reach  of households at the effective frequency level media planners choose an effective frequency based on the communication goals communication goals vary across the continuum from awareness preference attitude change to trial purchase and repurchase to change brand attitude requires more exposures higher effective frequency than does creating brand awareness if the effective frequency is set for a given communication goal the reach at that effective frequency level will be the effective reach lets go back to the super bowl example a total of  of households see the ad twice by watching the entirety of the game during the first half  of households see the ad once but then dont watch the second half another  join the game in progress and see the ad once during the second half thus    see the ad just once this leaves  of households      who never see the ad in summary the frequency distribution is reach of  at the frequency of  reach of  at the frequency of  and reach of  at the frequency of  also called nonreach lets extend this example by continuing this hypothetical campaign on the thursday after the super bowl the advertiser does one more media blitz showing an encore of their super bowl ad on all major networks during the prime time slot of  to  pm this practice of advertising on multiple channels at the same time ensures that most people will see the ad regardless of which channel they watch table  shows the viewer data collected from households across the country with the percentage of households who were watching during various combinations of the three time slots table  ratings of the three time slots   viewers of the ads time slot data segment super bowl first half super bowl second half prime time blitz frequency  of households           x          x          x    x x      x   x      x x    x x x   rating        media planners can process this data to compute the frequency distribution see table  by tallying the total percentage of households that saw the ad    etc times table  frequency distribution of the plan frequency reach         if the advertiser believes that its ads are only effective if they are seen at least twice then the advertiser will want to know what percentage of households saw the ad two or more times in this example the effective reach is  because that is the sum of the reaches for frequencies  and  combined grps of this media plan were  and reach was  because  of households did not watch during any of the three times the ad was shown resulting in an average frequency of  the frequency distribution of the plan is in table b that is  percent of the households watched the time slot three times  percent twice  percent once and  percent did not watch at all  setting communication goals media planners can set communication goals based on the level of reach that is how many of the target audience should be reached with the media plan say   or  theoretically a reach of  is possible but it is rarely a communication goal because some audience members may not use any of the media making them unreachable what then would be the optimal level of reach for a given product category or a market situation there is no quick answer to this question it all depends on the media planners analysis of major factors facing the brand media experts suggest high reach is appropriate when something new is associated with the brand such as new features new sales incentives new packaging or new service opportunities the newness requires a high level of awareness among the target audience a high reach is also often necessary in three other situations a advertising in support of sales promotion activities b for reminder advertising for a mass market product and c when the brand faces severe competition when setting levels of frequency media planners have more rules of thumb to choose from when setting levels of reach for example media planners have often been setting a frequency of  during a purchase cycle following michael naples seminal study of effective frequency published in  naples study suggests that there is a threshold level of repetition advertising below the threshold level will be ineffective therefore three exposures during a purchase cycle are necessary many media planners still use this rule in setting the effective frequency of a media plan more recently philip jones found that one exposure generates the highest proportion of sales and that additional exposures add very little to the effect of the first erwin ephron further developed the concept of recency planning and suggested that one exposure within a purchase cycle should be set as close to the actual purchase moment as possible recency planning starts with the idea that when is more important than how many that is advertising will be most effective if it is timed to when a consumer is in the market to buy the product or service in the shortterm therefore additional exposures are likely to be wasteful because audience members are not in the buying mode in some cases advertisers know when consumers are in the market such as wyomings ads during the spring when many people are planning summer vacations joseph w ostrow created a decision model to help media planners determine the optimal frequency level through assessing marketing factors copy factors and media factors starting with a base effective frequency of  the media planner makes frequency adjustments based on a series of  factors in three categories as illustrated in table  each category includes several statements upon which the media planner makes judgments by circling an appropriate rating in that row of the chart for example the first factor asks the planner to rate whether the product is an established brand or new brand a totally new brand will require higher frequency than an established brand and so the planner would circle the  frequency adjustment after assessing the factors the media planner sums the adjustments to calculate the recommended effective frequency media planners may modify the model by adding or removing statements to make the estimate more appropriate table  the ostrow model of effective frequency low required frequency frequency adjustment high required frequency market factors established brand     new brand high brand share     low brand share high brand loyalty     low brand loyalty long purchase cycle     short purchase cycle less frequent usage     frequency usage low share of voice     high share of voice target other group     target old people or children message factors low message complexity     high message complexity high message uniqueness     low message uniqueness continuing campaign     new campaign productfocused message     imagefocused message low message variety     high message variety high wearout     low wearout large advertising units     small advertising units media factors low clutter     high clutter favorable editorial setting     neutral editorial setting high audience attentiveness     low audience attentiveness continuous scheduling     pulse or flight scheduling few media vehicles     more media vehicles high repeat exposure media     low repeat exposure media when setting frequency level goals media planners know that higherlevel communication goals such as persuasion and lead generation as shown in the expanded arf model in figure a require higher frequency levels for example brand awareness usually requires a lower level of frequency than advertising persuasion and lead generation in other words a media plan that intends to change the brand preference among consumers of competing brands would need a higher frequency of advertising exposures than a media plan that intends to introduce a new brand in addition to the reach and frequency goals media planners may set goals for other forms of communication for example promotional activities may be used in a media plan such as sweepstakes contests and coupons media planners estimate and specify response rates for these activities by establishing communication goals media planners set the stage for assessing the effectiveness of a media plan at the end  media strategies media planners make three crucial decisions where to advertise geography when to advertise timing and what media categories to use media mix  moreover they make these decisions in the face of budget constraints the actual amount of money that an advertiser spends on marketing communications can vary widely from billions of dollars for multinational giants such as procter  gamble to a few thousand dollars for local momnpop stores in general companies spend as little as  to more than  of revenues on advertising depending on the nature of their business regardless of the budget some media options are more cost effective than others it is the job of media planners to formulate the best media strategies  allocating budget across media categories geographies and time lets look at each of these three decisions in turn and then consider cost effectiveness  media mix decisions which media should the advertiser use media planners craft a media mix by considering a budgetconscious intersection between their media objectives and the properties of the various potential media vehicles that is they consider how each media vehicle provides a costeffective contribution to attaining the objectives and then they select the combination of vehicles that best attain all of the objectives when making media mix decisions planners look to a whole spectrum of media not just to traditional media vehicles such as tv radio and print that is media planners consider all the opportunities that consumers have for contact with the brand these opportunities can be nontraditional brand contact opportunities such as online advertising sweepstakes sponsorships product placements direct mail mobile phones blogs and podcasts the scale and situations of media use are especially important when evaluating suitable brand contact opportunities for example product placement in a video game makes sense if the target audience plays video games sweepstakes make sense if many of the target audience find sweepstakes attractive  mix strategy media concentration vs media dispersion a media planners first media mix decision is to choose between a media concentration approach or a media dispersion approach the media concentration approach uses fewer media categories and greater spending per category this lets the media planner create higher frequency and repetition within that one media category media planners will choose a concentration approach if they are worried that their brands ads will share space with competing brands leading to confusion among consumers and failure of the media objectives for example when nestle launched its  fatfree cereal fitnesse the similarity of ads actually increased the sales of the competing kelloggs special k cereal media planners can calculate or measure share of voice to estimate the dominance of their message in each category of media they use share of voice is the percentage of spending by one brand in a given media category relative to the total spending by all brands that are advertising in that media category a company can create a high share of voice with a concentrated media strategy that is the company can be the dominant advertiser in a product category in the chosen channel moreover because only one set of creative materials will need to be prepared a concentrated media strategy lets advertisers spend a higher percentage of their budget on frequency and reach but a concentrated strategy is also an alleggsinonebasket strategy if the particular ad is not well received or the particular media category only reaches a fraction of the intended target audience then it will perform poorly in contrast media planners choose a media dispersion approach when they use multiple media categories such as a combination of television radio newspapers and the internet media planners will use dispersion if they know that no single media outlet will reach a sufficient percentage of the target audience for example a concentrated approach using only ads on the internet might reach only  of the target consumers because some consumers dont use the internet similarly a concentrated approach using national news magazines might reach only  of the target audience because not every target customer reads these magazines but a dispersed approach that advertises in print magazines as well as on web sites might reach  of the target audience media planners also like the dispersion approach for the reinforcement that it brings  consumers who see multiple ads in multiple media for a given brand may be more likely to buy table  illustrates the media concentration and media dispersion approaches to the media category allocations for three hypothetical brands of fatigue relief medication advertisers of zipium took a media dispersion approach by allocating the budget relatively evenly across all four media categories while advertisers of pepzac and enerzid took a media concentration approach by spending the budget in one or two media categories table  hypothetical media mix and share of voice competing brand television magazine direct mail internet total spend by brand zipium otc      pepzac      enerzid      total spend by category        brands voice in each category zipium otc      pepzac      enerzid      total       notice the share of voice figures for the three brands in television zipium gets a  share of voice in television because it spent  out of the total of  million spent on television advertising by fatigue remedy medications pepzac gets  because it spent  out of the  million spent on tv enerzid receives a  share of voice in tv because it spent no money in that media category pepzac enjoys a dominant share of voice in television because it has the highest percentage of spending in that category looking across the other media categories we see the effects of a concentrated versus dispersed media approach although zipium spends the greatest amount of money it only achieves dominant share of voice in one of the four media categories due to dispersal each of the other brands also dominates one category for example enerzid concentrates all of its spending on the internet thus although enerzid has a small budget it manages to dominate that one category through its concentrated media approach the media concentration approach is often preferable for brands that have a small or moderate media budget but intend to make a great impact for example godaddycom an internet hosting service bought two spots in the super bowl in  because of the controversial nature of the ad fox networks canceled the second run of the ad the controversy over the pulled ad resulted in more than  million of free publicity the single paid ad plus heavy media coverage of the incident greatly increased the awareness of godaddy the spot also earned godaddy a  share of voice a percentage which some say is the largest share of voice attributed to any super bowl advertiser ever  media category selection whether media planners select media concentration or media dispersion they still must pick the media categoryies for the media plan different media categories suit different media objectives most media options can be classified into three broad categories mass media direct response media and pointofpurchase media a media planners choice will depend on the media objectives if the media planner wants to create broad awareness or to remind the largest possible number of consumers about a brand then he or she will pick mass media such as television radio newspaper and magazine if the media planner wants to build a relationship with a customer or encourage an immediate sales response then direct response media such as direct mail the internet and mobile phone are good choices for example online ads for car insurance such as link directly to the application process to capture the customers right at the time they are interested in the service finally if media planners want to convert shoppers into buyers then they might use pointofpurchase media such as sampling coupons and priceoff promotions in short each of these three categories of media serve a different role in moving the customer from brand awareness to brand interest to purchase intent to actual purchase and then to repurchase an integrated campaign such as the one described for pgs fusion shaving system might use multiple categories  combining national tv ads to introduce the product internet media to provide onetoone information and instore displays to drive sales the creative requirements of a media category also affect media planners decisions each media category has unique characteristics for example television offers visual impact that interweaves sight and sound often within a narrative storyline magazines offer high reproduction quality but must grab the consumer with a single static image direct mail can carry free samples but can require compelling ad copy in the letter and backend infrastructure for some form of consumer response by return mail telephone or internet rich media ads on the internet can combine the best of tvstyle ads with interactive response via a clickthrough to the brands own web site media planners need to consider which media categories provide the most impact for their particular brand the costs of developing creative materials specific to each media category can also limit media planners use of the media dispersion approach          geographic allocation decisions in addition to allocating advertising by media category media planners must allocate advertising by geography in general a company that sells nationally can take one of three approaches to geographic spending allocation a national approach advertise in all markets a spot approach advertise only in selected markets or a combined national plus spot approach advertise in all markets with additional spending in selected markets media planners will choose a national approach if sales are relatively uniform across the country such as for tide laundry detergent or toyota automobiles a national approach will reach a national customer base with a national advertising program for many other products however a companys customers are concentrated in a limited subset of geographic areas which makes a spot approach more efficient for example the sales of leisure boats are much higher in markets such as florida california and michigan due to the large water areas in these markets a spot approach will target these states for example a leisure boat manufacturer such as sea ray might use a spot approach to target florida california and michigan while not advertising in other states like iowa or nebraska media planners perform geographic analyses by assessing the geographic concentration of sales in two ways the first method is called the brand development index bdi of a geographic region bdi measures the concentration of sales of a companys brand in that region the second method is called the category development index cdi and measures the concentration of sales of the product category across all brands in that region media planners use bdi to measure a brands performance in a given market in comparison with its average performance in all markets where the brand is sold mathematically bdi is a ratio of a brands sales in a given geographic market divided by the average of its sales in all markets bdi is calculated for each geographic area market x using the following formula market xs share of total brand sales bdi   x  market xs share of us population consider the bdi for visitors to the state of louisiana  the geographic concentration of people who travel to louisiana for business or pleasure the bdi for houston is  because houston is  of the us population but houstonians make up  of visitors to louisiana      because houstons bdi is higher than  it means that many more houstonians come to louisiana than the average from other cities in contrast the new york city area has a very low bdi of only  because even though new york city has  of the us population this city contributes only  of visitors to louisiana this disparity in bdi influences louisianas advertising strategy media planners will tend to allocate more resources to high bdi markets greater than  than to low bdi markets the point is that even though new york city has a much larger population it has a much lower concentration of travelers to louisiana given that the cost of advertising is often proportional to the population it reaches advertising in new york city will be far more expensive than advertising in houston because such a low percentage of new yorkers travel to louisiana advertising to new yorkers will be less effective than advertising to houstonians bdi doesnt tell the whole story however because bdi only measures the concentration of current sales bdi doesnt reflect the concentration of potential sales as measured by sales of the entire product category so media planners use another number cdi in addition to bdi when allocating resources for spot advertising cdi is a measure of a product categorys performance in a given geographic market in comparison to its average performance in all markets in the country the sales of a product category include the sales of all the brands the companys and competitors brands or at least all major brands that fall in the category the cdi formula is market xs share of total category sales cdi   x  market xs share of us population notice the similarities and differences of the cdi formula compared to the bdi formula the denominator of the cdi formula is the same as that of the bdi formula but the numerator for cdi is the share of the product category in a given market for example if the sales of the product category in market x account for  percent of its total sales in the us and the population in that market is  percent of the us population then the cdi for that market will be  which is  percent below the average of  that means a poorerthanaverage consumption of the product category which means that market x may be less promising for spot market advertising on the other hand markets with a high cdi higher than  may be a better market for that product category because bdi and cdi can vary independently media planners use both numbers to guide allocation decisions in general bdi reflects the concentration of existing sales while cdi reflects the concentration of potential sales in a geographic region returning to the example of leisure boats we find that states such as california florida and michigan have high cdis yet the maker of a line of small boats that arent suitable for the ocean may have very high bdi in michigan but a very low bdi in california and florida because a bdi or a cdi for a given market can each be either above or below the average there will be four possible combinations as shown in table  the four combinations represent two extreme cases and two mixed cases at the one extreme in a market with both a high cdi and a high bdi both above  media planners will seek to maintain high market share implied by high bdi and might even consider more advertising to gain market share because of the good category potential implied by high cdi of the market at the other extreme in a market with both a low cdi and a low bdi media planners may eschew spending their advertising dollars there due to the low concentration of potential consumption  the small boat maker may ignore new mexico table  four scenarios of bdi and cdi cdi bdi high low high high cdi high bdi low cdi high bdi low high cdi low bdi low cdi low bdi the mixed cases represent situations in which the percentage of brand sales in a region differs significantly from the percentage of category sales a market with a high cdi and a low bdi deserves serious consideration because it suggests a large opportunity for increased sales before devoting advertising dollars the company will want to understand why it has such poor sales of its brand low bdi in an area with high category sales for example the maker of small boats may learn that californians dont buy the brands boats because the boats are unsuitable for the ocean if the causes of the poor brand performance can be identified and solved such as by changing the product or finding better distribution then more advertising should be worthwhile a low cdi and high bdi represents the enviable position of selling well in a market that does not otherwise buy products in that category a market with low cdi and a high bdi requires continued advertising support to maintain the superior brand performance one approach to resource allocation uses a weighted sum of bdi and cdi  spending money in each geography in proportion to a combined bdi plus cdi score with this approach media planners need to first assign a weight to the bdi and to the cdi these two weights represent the relative importance of the bdi and cdi and the sum of two weights should equal  on the one hand media planners might choose a high weight on cdi if they feel their brand is representative of the broader category and they expect their brand to attain a geographic pattern of sales that matches that of the category on the other hand they might place a high weight on bdi if their brand is unique the category is very diverse or the company wants to grow sales among current customers consider a hypothetical example in which a media planner thinks the bdi is three times more important than the cdi in allocating spending he or she would use a weight of  with the bdi values and  with the cdi values of each geography to calculate a weighted sum and a percentage for each of the markets then she can use the percentage as a base for spending allocation in each market as show in table  that is market a will receive  percent of the media spending market b will receive  percent and so on all the percentages added together will equal  percent table  hypothetical spending allocation in markets with  bdi and  cdi geographic market bdi cdi  weighted bdi  weighted cdi weighted sum spending percentage north       east       central       south       west       media planners can use another index  growth potential index gpi  to assess growth opportunities in geographic markets gpi is simply the ratio of the cdi over the bdi and is one way of quantifying the discrepancy between category sales the potential sales for the market and brand sales current sales to measure of the growth potential of a brand in a market the formula of the gpi is as follows market xs cdi gpi   x  market xs bdi for example if market x has a cdi of  and a bdi of  then the gpi will be  this high value of gpi suggests a growth potential of  in this market  that if the brand sold as well in that market as it does nationwide sales would grow  of course media planners should examine the specific conditions of a high gpi market before allocating resources to assess the true possibilities for growth when a brand sells in many markets the gpi can facilitate the selection of markets for additional spot advertising spending  media schedule decisions having decided how to advertise the media mix and where to advertise allocation across geography media planners need to consider when to advertise given a fixed annual budget should all months receive equal amounts of money or should some months receive more of the budget while other months receive less or nothing media planners can choose among three methods of scheduling continuity flight and pulse continuity scheduling spreads media spending evenly across months for example with an annual budget of  a year continuity scheduling would allocate exactly  per month this method ensures steady brand exposure over each purchase cycle for individual consumers it also takes advantage of volume discounts in media buying however because continuity scheduling usually requires a large budget it may not be practical for small advertisers the flight scheduling approach alternates advertising across months with heavy advertising in certain months and no advertising at all in other months for example a board game maker like parker brothers might concentrate its advertising in the fall when it knows that many people buy board games as gifts for the holidays or with the same budget of  for example a different brand could spend  per month during each of six months  january march may july september and december  and spend nothing during the other months in hopes that the impact of advertising in the previous month can last into the following month pulse scheduling combines the first two scheduling methods so that the brand maintains a low level of advertising across all months but spends more in selected months for example an airline like united airlines might use a low level of continuous advertising to maintain brand awareness among business travelers united airlines might also have seasonal pulses to entice winterweary consumers to fly to sunny climes in budget allocation terms a consumer goods brand may spend  in each of the twelve months to maintain the brand awareness and spend an additional  in january march may july september and december to attract brand switchers from competing brands the pulse scheduling method takes advantage of both the continuity and flight scheduling methods and mitigates their weaknesses however this does not mean it is good for all products and services which method is the most appropriate for a given campaign depends on several important factors how do media planners select among continuity flight and pulse scheduling approaches the timing of advertising depends on three factors seasonality consumers product purchase cycle and consumers interval between decisionmaking and consumption the first and most important factor is sales seasonality companies dont advertise fur coats in summer and suntan lotions in winter likewise some products sell faster around specific holidays such as flowers on mothers day candy on halloween and ornaments around christmas companies with seasonal products are more likely to choose flight scheduling to concentrate their advertising for the peak sales season other goods however such as everyday products like milk and toothpaste may lack a seasonal pattern everyday goods may be better served by a continuity approach media planners can use a breakdown of sales by month to identify if their brand has seasonal fluctuations which can serve as a guide for the allocation they can allocate more money to highsales months and less to lowsales months the second factor that affects when advertising is scheduled is the product purchase cycle the interval between two purchases fastmoving consumer goods such as bread soft drinks and toilet paper probably require continuous weekly advertising in a competitive market to constantly reinforce brand awareness and influence frequentlymade purchase decisions in contrast lessfrequently purchased products such as carpet cleaner or floor polisher may only need advertising a few times a year a third factor that affects media scheduling is the time interval between when the purchase decision is made and when a product or service is actually bought and consumed for example many families who take summer vacations may plan their trips months before the actual trips that is they make purchase decision in advance thus travel industry advertisers will schedule their ads months before the summer as we saw in the wyoming example destination advertising has to be in sync with the time of decision making instead of the actual consumption time new product launches usually require initial heavy advertising to create brand awareness and interest the launch period may last from a few months to a year as mentioned earlier pg launched its gillette sixbladed fusion shaving system with advertising on super bowl xl the most expensive form of advertising in the world if consumers like the product then personal influence in the form of wordofmouth or market force brand visibility in life and media coverage will play a role in accelerating the adoption of a new brand personal influence and market force are unplanned messages which often play an important role in new product launches media planners should take advance of these unplanned messages in a new product launch campaign  designing media tactics establishing media objectives and developing media strategies are the primary tasks of media planners designing media tactics is largely carried out by media buyers media buyers select media vehicles to implement established media strategies among the major factors that affect media vehicle selection are reach and frequency considerations  reach considerations as a major component of media objectives the planned level of reach affects not only media mix decisions but also what media vehicles are used in each media category high levels of reach will require a different set of media vehicles than low levels of reach that is high levels of reach can be better served with a mix that includes multiple media vehicles with different audiences so that crossmedia duplication of audience is minimal for example if there are three magazines that each reach a portion of the target audience but that have few readers who read more than one magazine advertising in these three magazines would reach the widest target audience possible because of the low overlap of the readers of the these magazines what are some ways to maximize the levels of reach one way is to analyze the audience composition of media vehicles by using syndicated media research for example crosstabulations of simmons data can be conducted to identify several magazines that reach the target audience of women aged  to  with little crosstitle duplication  few readers of one magazine also read other the magazines these magazines can be used to implement high levels of reach in the media plan when audience data are not available for crossvehicle comparisons you can select competing media vehicles in the same media category because there is usually less duplication among the competing media vehicles for example most people who are interested in news may read one of the three major news weeklies newsweek time and us news and world report few people read all three of them therefore running a print ad in all the three news magazines can reach a wide audience in television media buyers sometimes use roadblocking which means the placement of commercials in all major television networks in the same period of time no matter which television channel an audience member tunes in at that time they have the opportunity to watch the commercial the roadblocking approach has become more expensive and less effective recently because of increasing fragmentation of television audience the term has been extended to the online world however where it has been very effective to roadblock in the online world a media planner can buy all the advertising on a web site for a hour period such as coke did for its launch of c and ford did for its launch the f each company bought all the ad space on the front page of yahoo for a hour period the yahoo front page draws  million visitors a day alternatively media planners can roadblock yahoo msn and aol all on the same day as coke and pepsi have both done the results can produce an astonishing astronomical amount of reach said mohan renganathan of mediavest worldwide one of the biggest services for buying ad space  frequency considerations in contrast to high levels of reach high levels of frequency can be effectively achieved through advertising in a smaller number of media vehicles to elevate audience duplications within these media vehicles a commercial that runs three times during a minute television program will result in higher message repetition than the same commercial that runs once in three different programs broadcast media are often used when high levels of frequency are desired in a relatively short period of time broadcast media usually enjoy a vertical audience who tune in to a channel for more than one program over hours another phenomenon in broadcast media is audience turnover which refers to the percentage of audience members who tune out during a program programs with low audience turnover are more effective for high levels of frequency  media vehicle characteristics with reach and frequency considerations in mind media buyers will compare media vehicles in terms of both quantitative and qualitative characteristics quantitative characteristics are those that can be measured and estimated numerically such as vehicle ratings audience duplication with other vehicles geographic coverage and costs media buyers will choose vehicles with high ratings and less crossvehicle audience duplication when they need high levels of reach media buyers also evaluate the geographic coverage of media vehicles when implementing spot advertising such as heavy advertising in certain geographic regions finally media buyers pay attention to the costs of each media vehicle when two media vehicles are similar in major aspects media buyers choose the less expensive media vehicle there are two basic calculations of media vehicle cost the first one cost per rating point cpp is used primarily for broadcast media vehicles to derive the cpp divide the cost of a second commercial by the ratings of the vehicle in which the advertisement is placedsidebar definition cpp the cost of a broadcast ad per rating point  of the population provided by the media vehicle that shows the ad the formula for calculating cpp is as follows cost per rating point  cost of the ad  rating of the vehicle for example if the cost for a second commercial abcs greys anatomy television program is  and the rating of the program is  then cpp for this buy will be  another media cost term is cost per thousand impressions cpm which is the cost to have  members of the target audience exposed to an adsidebar definition for cpm cost per thousand m is the latin abbreviation for  the cost per  impressions for an ad as you recall the impressions are simply opportunities to see the ad one difference between cpp and cpm is that cpm also contains the size of a vehicle audience cpm is calculated in two steps first the gross impressions that an ad may get is calculated using the rating of the program and the size of the market population second cpm is calculated using the cost and gross impressions the two formulas are as follows gross impressions  audience size  rating   cpm  cost  gross impressions   using the previous example the rating of a television program is  and the cost for a second commercial is  if there are  adults in the market then cpm for the buy will be as follows             gross impressions                     cpm         thus cpm for this media buy is  cpm can be calculated for different media including online media for example an informal consensus of online media buyers agreed that a  cpm asking price seemed about average to pay for advertising on socialnetworking like friendster yahoo  and britains faceparty in contrast to these quantitative characteristics qualitative characteristics of media vehicles are those that are primarily judgmental such as vehicle reputation editorial environment reproduction quality and added values for example media vehicles vary in reputation newspapers such as the new york times and the wall street journal generally enjoy high reputation furthermore the editorial environment can be more or less favorable for advertisers the impact of food ads for instance can be enhanced when they appear around articles about health or nutrition likewise some magazines are better in reproduction quality than others which enhance the impact of the ads finally some media vehicles offer added values added values take various forms and they benefit advertisers without additional cost for example a newspaper may publish a special page whose editorial context fits an advertisers products or a television channel may host a local event in association with a car dealership media buyers can work with the media to invent creative forms of added values for advertisers  selection of media vehicles media buyers can use tools like the one shown below to make the process of selecting a media vehicle easier to use the selection tool shown in figure i develop a list of the potential vehicle candidates you are considering then select several quantitative and qualitative characteristics that are relevant to reach and frequency considerations such as quantitative characteristics like cpm or grp and qualitative characteristics like reputation and added value next make a table that lists the vehicle candidates in rows and the characteristics in columns now you can rate each of the characteristics of each vehicle on a scale of  to  then add all the numbers in each row dividing by the total number of characteristics columns to arrive at the rating for each vehicle the best media vehicles to choose are those with the highest index numbers in figure  vehicle  and vehicle  are the best ways to reach the target audience figure  selection of media vehicle based on quantitative and qualitative characteristics   qn qn qn ql ql ql index v        v        v        v         evaluating media plan effectiveness accountability is increasingly important in media planning as more advertisers expect to see returns on their investments in advertising because media spending usually accounts for  percent or more of the budget for typical advertising campaigns the effectiveness of media plans is of particular importance as a result media planners often make measures of the effectiveness of a media plan an integral part of the media plan although sales results are the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of an advertising campaign the sales result is affected by many factors such as price distribution and competition which are often out of the scope of the advertising campaign it is important therefore to identify what measures are most relevant to the effectiveness of media planning and buying we will examine the topic of measurement in more detail in chapters  and  but here is an introduction to measurement that is specific to media plans  what to measure because of the hierarchical nature of the media effects the effectiveness of media planning should be measured with multiple indictors the first measure is the actual execution of scheduled media placements did the ads appear in the media vehicles in agreedupon terms media buyers look at tearsheets  copies of the ads as they have appeared in print media  for verification purposes for electronic media media buyers examine the ratings of the programs in which commercials were inserted to make sure the programs delivered the promised ratings if the actual program ratings are significantly lower than what the advertiser paid for the media usually make good for the difference in ratings by running additional commercials without charge the most direct measure of the effectiveness of media planning is the media vehicle exposure media planners ask how many of the target audience were exposed to the media vehicles and to ads in those vehicles during a given period of time this question is related to the communication goals in the media objectives if the measured level of exposure is near to or exceeds the planned reach and frequency then the media plan is considered to be effective several additional measures can be made of the target audience such as brand awareness  how many of the target audience are aware of the advertised brand comprehension  does the target audience understand the advertised brand is there any miscomprehension conviction  is the target audience convinced by ads how do they like the advertised brands action  how many of the target audience have purchased the advertised brand as a result of the media campaign the measured results of brand awareness comprehension conviction and action are often a function of both advertising creative and media planning even effective media planning may not generate anticipated cognitive affective and conative responses if the ads are poorly created and not appealing to the target audience on the other hand ineffective media planning may be disguised when the ads are highly creative and brilliant thus these measures should be reviewed by both creative directors and media planners to make accurate assessments of the effectiveness of the media plan  how to measure the measurement of the effectiveness of a media plan can be conducted by the advertising agency or by independent research services using methods such as surveys feedback tracking and observation each method has its strengths and weaknesses for example surveys can be conducted among a sampling of the target audience in the different periods of a media campaign such as in the beginning the middle and the end of the campaign surveys can ask questions about the target audiences media behavior advertising recall brand attitudes and actual purchase radiowatch for instance conducts monthly surveys on advertising recall of radio commercials in england radiowatch surveys  adults age  and asks them which radio commercials they remember hearing in the april  survey the mostrecalled ad was for tmobile with  of respondents recalling the ad an ad for mcdonalds had  recall while the ad for peugeot received  besides surveys feedback can be collected to measure the media and ad exposure of the target audience feedback devices such as reply cards tollfree numbers coupons and web addresses can be provided in ads so that tallies of the responses or redemptions can be made to estimate the impact of advertising media advertisers often use a different code in direct response ads to identify different media vehicles for example in the april   issue of businessweek the reply card for subscribing to the magazine had a code of jsd whereas the reply card bound into the may   issue of the magazine had a code of jse similarly when the garden of eatin gives coupons for its tortilla chips the upc code on the coupon indicates which media vehicle the coupon was in such as whether the coupon came from the  bolder boulder promotional calendar or from the organic and natural experience one  tour book of coupons in short by reviewing the different codes recorded media buyers can assess the response rate of each media vehicle as you can see from the radiowatch and garden of eatin examples one advantage of surveys over feedback devices is that surveys reach people who have taken no action on the product whereas feedback devices require the consumer to mail back click or call a tollfree number in this way surveys can help media buyers evaluate the effectiveness of an ad in relation to other ads whereas feedback devices help them evaluate the effectiveness of one media vehicle over another tracking is measurement method that media buyers use to track the effectiveness of online ads when a user visits a web site or clicks on a banner ad web servers automatically log that action in real time the logs of these visits and actions are very useful for media buyers because the buyers can use them to estimate the actual interaction of audience members with the interactive media for example a banner ad may have a code for each web site where the ad is placed media buyers can compare the clickthrough rates of the banner ad across all web sites daily to estimate the effectiveness of each web site media buyers are making more use of the tracking method given the increasing use of interactive media finally in the physical world media buyers can use observation to collect audience reaction information at the points of purchase or during marketing events for example researchers can be stationed in grocery stores to observe how consumers react to instore advertising or how they select an advertised brand in comparison of other brands the advantage of observation is that it provides rich detailed data on how consumers behave in real situations in response to the marketing communication the downside is that direct observation is more costly to conduct and tabulate this article described the media planning process starting from establishing media objectives through to developing media strategies and tactics and finally evaluating the effectiveness of the media plan youve learned how to identify your target audience evaluate different media vehicles on the basis of reach frequency and grps make prudent media mix decisions using tools like bdi and cdi and scheduling concepts like continuity flight and pulse scheduling make sound budget decisions using tools like cpp and cpm and finally evaluate the
