adoption of edge analytics cumulocity and option an innovative machine to machine mm wireless solution specialist combine their iot platform and iot device technologies to radically simplify the adoption of iot edge analytics processes for customers the combination allows edge analytics models to be rapidly evolved using the option cloudgate luvitred devicebased application and industrially deployed to the fielded devices with cumulocity device management dusseldorf germany — in recent years there has been a rapid growth in the use of computational analytics none more so than in the internet of things iot what originated as the detection of static thresholds like power exceeding a specified value has now evolved into applying far more complex formulae essentially building a synthetic mechanics ear which can anticipate the future operation of an asset based on their knowledge of how things should work and raise an alarm prior to failure these formulae are now used at many points in the overall solution with some assessing a single asset’s operation while others assess the combined process of multiple assets the value of these techniques has grown exponentially with their complexity however it is this complexity that can slow their development and complicate their mass deployment cumulocity and option recognise the development and operation of iot projects needs to be simple to ensure their efficient adoption for practical realworld situations this combination of cumulocity’s and option’s technologies allows the edge analytics models to be continuously evolved by subject matter experts and be mass deployed to a scheduled release cycle into the field “there is no single standard at the edge because the each vertical market brings its own hardware and interface protocol specifications option’s unique modular gateway with its swappable expansion cards provides the flexibility to connect almost any asset in any iot vertical market at the highest quality and lowest total cost of ownership in addition option’s unique luvitred software suite integrates the software protocols of the customer’s assets and applications seamlessly to the cumulocity iot platform this combination provides a real endtoend solution for customers” jörg palm chief marketing officer option luvitred is option’s latest enhancement to the cloudgate solution delivering a

different iot verticals and delivers true iot edge computing with luvitred stable and reliable iot applications can be built and delivered faster with less cost and risk processes that used to take days weeks and months – even before testing and review – now take only minutes or hours cumulocity’s device management capability provides the administration and management of the edge analytics applications models and configuration data the platform’s bulk operations completely remove the complexities of mass deployments by executing update schedules for any number of groups of devices which are monitored in realtime rollouts that would have consumed the resources of many field technicians are now avoided the integrity of the device data presented to the customers’ business applications is now assured during the transition “edge analytics is a powerful enabler for iot services like predictive maintenance which can significantly improve customer experience and reduce operational costs historically the complexity of the development and deployment of the analytics model has slowed its adoption the combination of the option cloudgate luvitred and cumulocity iot platform allows customers to focus on the value of edge analytics and avoid the inconvenience of managing the practical deployment of these models this provides all organisations with a low effort way to adopt edge analytics and the reassurance that it will be commercially ready at scale as soon as required” bernd gross ceo cumulocity see our joint webinar simplifying the adoption of edge analytics wed sep   cumulocity and device authority partner to secure the remote deployment and management of industrial intellectual property cumulocity and device authority a leading iot security automation platform

security challenges our partnership with cumulocity simplifies the implementation of policy and devicedriven security for all iot solutions” darron antill ceo device authority combining the capabilities of device authority’s leading iot security automation platform with cumulocity provides organisations with the ability to encrypt the data between the systems within the organisation’s it environment and the applications on the remotely deployed machines this provides organisations with the reassurance that their intellectual property is only able to be read by the authorised application in the intended machine the data is transferred in encrypted format throughout the solution and is only decrypted for authorised users on the iot platform when requested this allows the use of the intellectual property to be controlled by its owner thereby avoiding costly machine misconfigurations unauthorised duplication and reduction in competitive advantage the underlying endtoend data encryption also provides the foundation for more use cases in other vertical markets which require irrefutable auditability and traceability of measurement data and highlysecure user authenticated visibility of information important examples here are supply chain management in the food industry and the monitoring of patient health and wellbeing “with more and more manufacturers
