trials drugs and investigators contributing to asco this year to help you out we highlight a few interesting points abstracts over the past  years there have been some notable changes in therapeutic areas discussed at the american society of clinical oncology’s annual meeting it comes as no surprise that the immune oncology trend is growing year on year much like lung cancer on the other hand interest in breast cancer is steadily declining which could be due to the disappointing results of immune oncology within breast cancer another interesting fact is the gain in gastrointestinal cancer abstracts at this year’s conference after a relatively quiet  sponsor  trial activity of the  clinical trials that are cited at asco   key commercial sponsors have seen considerable fluctuations in trial activity when compared to asco  significant gains can be seen in the trial activity of bms pfizer and roche whereas novartis sanofi and johnson  johnson have seen a decrease in trial numbers tascan’s top  drugs to watch at asco  with preliminary results already disclosed for some drugs debuting at asco tascan highlights some new drugs being discussed in the immune oncology space

tumors in addition to antipdl compound incyte have a promising combination with pembrolizumab and an indolamine  dioxygenase inhibitor epacadostat investigator  sponsor collaborations looking at the percentage of top oncology experts used by the leading commercial sponsors of trials talked about at asco  it’s clear that roche and merck have an evenly distributed usage of investigators in both the
