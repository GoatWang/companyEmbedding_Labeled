discrimination news  prohibiting employees from wearing religious signs or apparel is discrimination  add to shortlist share print news  media all news cases articles insights practice areas employment  discrimination   employment  discrimination  rebecca tuck bruno gil ag sharpston’s opinion prohibiting employees from wearing religious signs or apparel is discrimination bougnaoui and anor v micropole sa  july  at the end of may advocate general kokott in the belgium case of achbita and anor v gs secure solutions nv expressed the view that an employer was not directly discriminating in banning an employee from wearing an islamic headscarf in the workplace and that while the measure could be indirectly discriminatory it could potentially be justified in pursuance of their policy of religious and ideological neutrality this might be thought to be consistent with the judgment of the echr in sas v france  eqlr  in which any interference with rights to private life under art  echr to religion under art  or to nondiscrimination under art  by banning the veil in public was found to be justified   a different analysis is proffered by advocate general sharpston who has delivered her opinion on a referral to the ecj from the cour d’appel de paris in the case of bougnaoui and anor v micropole sa the first question is whether  dismissing an islamic employee for wearing her headscarf at work contrary to specific instructions is directly discriminatory and if so whether it can be  defended under article  of the eu equal treatment framework directive no as being a  ‘genuine and determining occupational requirement’ the basis for microple’s decision to dismiss ms  bougnaoui was that a client had found her wearing of a headscarf to be embarrassing to a number of their employees it was argued that there was a genuine and determining occupational requirement that ms bougnaoui not wear the religious apparel and in light of her refusal to comply they were justified in dismissing her having considered the strasbourg case law and the european legislation ag sharpston has taken the view that ms bougnaoui’s dismissal amounted to direct discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief could micropole then turn to article  to defend this dismissal ag sharpston noted that recital  of the directive states that the derogation should apply only ‘in very limited circumstances’ the eu case law provides that this must be interpreted strictly ie only where it is absolutely necessary in order to undertake the professional activity in question ag sharpston cites two examples to demonstrate first a male sikh employee in a post requiring protective headgear may not be able to insist on wearing his turban secondly a female muslim working with dangerous factory machinery cannot insist on wearing attire that would give rise to safety concerns beyond that ag sharpston found it hard to envisage any other scenarios where the requirement is absolutely necessary it follows in ag sharpston’s view that the mere commercial interests of a business its profit margins or customer satisfaction will not suffice micropole should not succeed in justifying their actions under article  to interpret the article as micropole have sought to do would risk ‘normalising’ the derogation which is to be applied in only the most limited of circumstances ag sharpston then went on to consider in case she was wrong on direct discrimination whether micropole’s actions amounted to indirect discrimination if so could they be objectively justified as a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary under article b here ag sharpston considered it could be argued that the interest of the employer’s business could constitute a legitimate aim the freedom to carry on business is not however an absolute right it is subject to limitations imposed by the right to equal treatment these two protected rights – the right to carry on a business and the right to manifest one’s religion  are potentially in conflict as was the case here it is then a question of proportionality there are many factors which will affect whether a requirement is proportionate ag sharpston takes the view that in the vast majority of cases a proportionate accommodation can be found as a last resort however the business interest in generating maximum profit should give way to the employee’s right to manifest her religious belief micropole’s discrimination in this case could therefore not be justified as a proportionate aim ag sharpston ended her opinion by drawing attention to the ‘insidiousness of the argument “but we need to do x because otherwise our customers won’t like it” where the customer’s attitude may itself be indicative of prejudice based on one of the “prohibited factors” such as religion it seems to me particularly dangerous to excuse the employer from compliance with an equal treatment requirement in order to pander to that prejudice’   the ecj is due to hear this matter along with achbita and anor v gs secure solutions nv towards the end of the year   for ag sharpston’s opinion in bougnaoui and

micropole sa friday  july  miller samuel hill brown employment law  hits we recently posted a blog on the case of achbita v gs which can be found here in which the advocate general gave the opinion that a ban on all religious political and philosophical symbols did not amount to direct discrimination against a muslim woman who wished to wear a headscarf she noted that it could be indirectly discriminatory but was objectively justified a different advocate general has now given a contrasting opinion in the similar case of bougnaoui v micropole sa concluding that dismissing an employee for wearing an islamic headscarf at work in breach of an instruction not to was directly discriminatory this opens up further debate on the wearing of religious clothing and symbols in the workplace in bougnaoui the employee had been told when recruited that she would not be able to wear her headscarf at all times due to the customer facing nature of her role following a site visit to a customer the customer complained about her wearing of the headscarf and requested she not do so in future when this was raised with her she refused to comply with the customer’s wishes and was dismissed she was unsuccessful in her claim of religious discrimination in the french courts and her case was referred to the european court of justice ecj the question for the ecj was whether presuming this treatment was discriminatory whether it could be justified as a ‘genuine and determining occupational requirement’ it was not clear what the terms were applied to ms bougnaoui in terms of prohbiting the wearing of her headscarf she argued that it applied to the wearing of her headscarf when in contact with customers whereas micropole alleged that there was a general ban which applied to all religious signs when visiting a customer the ag found that regardless of what the policy was it was clear that ms bougnaoui’s dismissal was linked to the provision prohibiting wearing religious signs  although ms bougnaoui was not dismissed because she was muslim the ag was of the view that the relevant directive extends to manifestations of religion or belief in providing protection from direct discrimination it was clear that ms bougnaoui’s dismissal was linked to the manifestation of her religious belief on this basis she had been treated less favourably than other employees in a comparable situation as another employee not wearing anything in manifestation of his or her religion would not have been dismissed micropole had therefore directly discriminated against her in order for the dismissal to be lawful the policy would have to amount to a “genuine and determining occupational requirement” the ag concluded that it did not she noted that this exception should only be available in very limited circumstances and not used to justify a blanket exception for all the activities carried out by an employee the ag gave examples of health and safety cases where particular religious attire may present a danger where prohibiting the wearing of the attire would be justified the ag found that micropole were relying on commercial interests and the wishes of a client to justify discrimination but direct discrimination cannot be justified on the grounds of financial loss further while micropole has the freedom to conduct a business that might be subject to protecting the rights of others in this case the right of ms bougnaoui not to be discriminated against on the grounds of her religion the ag therefore found that the requirement for ms bougnaoui to remove her headscarf was not a genuine and determining occupational requirement which was justified noting that to allow the legislation to be interpreted so that businesses could justify discrimination on the basis of commercial grounds or interaction with clients would not be right the ag also goes on to consider indirect discrimination in the event that the ecj disagrees with her that there was direct discrimination in this regard she concluded that the policy could be indirectly discriminatory which can be justified if the policy is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim she noted that the interests of the employer’s business constitutes a legitimate aim and the key issue in a given case will be proportionality she notes that in a customer facing role a ban may be proportionate if it prohibits the wearing of religious apparel which covers the entire face and eyes whereas this same ban may not be appropriate in a noncustomer facing role this decision poses interesting questions given its divergence from the opinion given by the advocate general in the achbita v gs case in that case the ag found that a blanket ban on all religious and philosophical symbols could be objectively justified with reference to the business’s interests and the customer facing nature of the business that would appear to directly conflict with the decision reached in this case indeed the achbita opinion has been the subject of criticism as it was not clear what in particular about a customer facing role made it necessary that the employee was not identified with any particular religion there was also some criticism of the suggestion by the ag that the employee’s religion could be ‘left at the door’ while in the workplace the ag in the bougnaoui case appears to disagree with this noting ‘it would be entirely wrong to suppose that whereas one’s sex and skin colour accompany one everywhere somehow one’s religion does not’ the ecj is still to give its judgment in both cases later this year and it remains to be seen whether it will follow the respective opinions of the advocates general given the divergences of opinion agreement with the ag in both cases could result in conflicting precedent and uncertainty it is to be hoped that the decisions of the court provide some clarity on the issue tweet government consults over court fee changes admissibility of settlement discussions
