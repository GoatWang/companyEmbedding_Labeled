experiences are engineered  valtech valtech product thinking in digital automotive  années il y a the term digital transformation has been omnipresent in the it business ever since mit center for digital business and capgemini published their first report on digital transformation in  digitalization has percolated through every social and economic area of our everyday existence digital agencies such as valtech have made it their mission to escort companies on this path of change – and therefore we offer services for all enterprise digital touch points our portfolio encompasses the entire range from ecommerce and digital experience solutions to ux and service design to digital strategy consulting while digital transformation is dealing with changes in the value creation chain of the company the internet of things iot focuses on the networking of the physical products themselves the idea behind the internet of things has been around for a while already and the term iot itself was coined as early as the turn of the millennium by the autoid center of mit the more puzzling however is it that to date no standardized iot infrastructure across businesses has emerged valtech has accumulated many years of solid experience in the area of networked vehicles for more than  years we have been accompanying the connect programs of various carmakers as a strategic partner we collaborate with one of the three biggest oems on its central backend platform for managing the connectivity of the vehicles with the outside world on a global level   what happens next  digital change is on full throttle and even seems to be accelerating more and more areas of application are being identified and the integration points of products with their outside world are steadily on the rise today i expect that my car is able to couple with my smart phone to unlock it to put a service call to the car repair shop of my choice and to help me to make an appointment if  the need arises i also want to be able to access my social media accounts while driving without being distracted too much i’d also like for my car to show me the shortest way to a vacant parking spot and ideally reserve it for me furthermore it should also inform me about accidents and danger points on my route the sky is the limit if it comes to imagining what else hybrid products half physical half digital could be capable of however this also comes at a price the complexity of it all is daunting and the use of the products in particular their configuring is often neither easy nor intuitive as is well known apple responded to that problem with its genius bar rather early in the game this successful concept was adopted by bmw with the introduction of its product genius in  the primary challenge though still remains to design the products of the digital world to be easier and more intuitive to use service design user design and product design should not be worked on separately – they need to mesh ever since the bauhaus design movement – dating from the first half of the th century – we have had here a long tradition of combining industrial products with an aesthetic practical and timeless design derived from the intended purpose of the product the ten tenets for good product design by dieter ram still hold true to this day and can be applied to today’s hybrid products today’s objective is to transfer these design principles into the digital world and think of solutions that are close to the product and serve their purpose good design is always simple andreas peters managing director

process kim sterenborg  the future of connected cars the automotive industry is currently going through some major disruptions cars are rapidly becoming more and more connected autonomous and electrified the traditional revenue distribution between manufacturers suppliers dealers and service providers is being challenged at the same time the oems and tier ones are investing heavily in these areas and the voices of cfos are becoming louder questioning the return on investments roland kero  the ‘digital’ in digital marketing and why you need guts to win think about it digital

design thinking big data  analytics omnichannel the agile marketing way internet of things  data management digital marketing digital video streaming immersive experiences  arvr the value given to an end user is at the heart of all valtech’s customer projects one of our key differentiators is our commitment to the experience of the end user and the importance we attach to the measurement of that experience in a market driven by fierce competition and where more and more products are being commoditised we believe that the development of consumercentered services is the key in successfully creating services that run through all the touch points between the end user and the brand valtech’s service designers help our clients to better understand consumers gleaning insights that are key to creating new concepts successful business cases and developing solutions that do not yet exist on the market our approach for each service or product that we design our goal is as much about creating a complete user experience as it is maximising return on investment our process includes market research and contextual interviews to better understand the consumer discussion and definition of the objectives of the users and the business visàvis the product or service aligning key stakeholders to a shared statement of vision and intention for the productservice identification of the client’s critical success factors for the productservice we visualise the process that users follow before during and after using the service and highlight the specific points at which the service responds or does not respond to the users’ needs by mapping the customer pathway we consistently track the performance of the productservice we imagine cocreate or prototype new and innovative concepts we measure objectives through multiple methods such as user testing questionnaires and the evaluation of quantitative data the analysis and interpretation of this data provides an overview of what needs to be changed about the productservice to better meet the user’s needs and your business objectives we lay the foundations for continuous improvement with each new release we present the progress made since the last one and the obstacles that remain this allows our customers to track changes made in nearreal time to help our client establish the order of priority we represent the various features on a simple matrix that shows the importance and the quality of these features for both consumers and the client a framework to identify the obstacles technology  dokumentips dokumentips upload login
