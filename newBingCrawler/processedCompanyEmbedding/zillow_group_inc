seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»zillow an overly sanguine hedge fund callmar  about zillow group zg jeffrey himelson longshort equity value contrarian research analystlinkedinsummarya hedge fund believes zillow can be a  billion company which is roughly x its current market capitalizationthe hedge fund is completely correct that zillow is operating in a burgeoning industry which will expand at a prodigious rate over the next few yearshowever its estimates are egregiously optimistic and there are significant risks on the horizon which can substantially stymie zillows growthzillow group nasdaqz nasdaqzg has recently been touted by a hedge fund as its best pick in november  a wellknown hedge fund in australia caledonia took a stake in zillow and explained that the company was its largest ever bet in its year history caledonias portfolio manager michael messara explained that his fund believed there was significant upside we believe zillow will be a us billion enterprise value company  around seven times the size it is today zillow has since fallen a bit so now its estimate is closer to x its current level the fund believes the australian online real estate is a blueprint for other markets and thinks that the us will follow suit however i believe this fund is being way too sanguine about zillows future prospects as there are significant risks on the horizon source zillowcom roadmap to my analysis i will first give a brief overview of zillows business then ill quickly discuss recent news and will provide a more granular overview of how the companys business has been operating following that section ill discuss the competitive landscape afterwards ill discuss its recent performance then highlight various risks and will discuss potential negative and positive catalysts ill then conclude with a valuation section and summarize my findings about zillow group zillow group inc operates real estate and homerelated information marketplaces on mobile and the web with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help people find information about homes and connect with local professionals zillow groups brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle renting buying selling financing and home improvement zillows database has more than  million us homes  homes for sale homes for rent and homes not currently on the market in addition zillow group provides advertising services to tens of thousands of real estate agents and rental and mortgage professionals helping them connect to consumers individuals and businesses that use zillows mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than  million homes and added more than  million home photos creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else these profiles include detailed information about homes including property facts listing information and purchase and sale data zillow also uses proprietary automated valuation models to provide current home value estimates or zestimates and current rental price estimates or rent zestimates on more than  million us homes its homerelated marketplaces benefit from network effects as more consumers go to its mobile applications and websites to use its products and services more real estate rental and mortgage professionals contribute content to distinguish themselves thereby making its marketplaces more useful and attracting additional consumers as of december   it had published more than  million reviews including more than  million reviews of local real estate agents and approximately  reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by users on zillow recent acquisition in february  zillow closed on its  billion acquisition of trulia zillow now operates under the name zillow group which is comprised of four real estate brands zillow trulia streeteasy hotpads and naked apartments source zillowgroupcom at the time of the acquisition ceo spencer rascoff said i am excited about how we are positioned relative to the size of the opportunity there is  billion spent in real estate advertising and i think zillow group is poised to benefit as that real estate advertising budget moves online it is notable to mention that caledonia believed zillow is worth  million while zillows ceo identified its total addressable market as  billion does caledonia sound a bit too sanguine to you now explanation of dual shares i just briefly want to mention why zillow has two ticker symbols in august  shares of zillow group split into two trading tickers z and zg zillow created a new class of shares nonvoting class c shares that was divvied up between its class a and b shareholders the c shares trade under the ticker symbol z while class a shares trade under the ticker zg the company created this new stock to make acquisitions and compensate executives however for investment purposes there is no material difference between these two share classes more granular business explanation zillow generates revenue through two separate avenues marketplace advertising and display advertising it sells its advertising to real estate rental and mortgage professionals premier agent advertising new auctionbased pricing platform before the latest quarter zillow charged customers for its premier agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on its buyers agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression however in the most recent quarter it implemented a new auctionbased pricing method for its premier agent product in this new system it determines cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by premier agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month this allows for dynamic pricing for the cost per impression based upon the demand in that particular zip code this new pricing method complements its selfserve account interface which it introduced to premier agents over the course of  the interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets impression buys and the duration of their advertising commitment management did not comment on how this change has been impacting its business and in the k said we are unable to predict whether this change to our pricing method will have a material impact on net sales revenue or other results of operations in its earnings call management gave further color on how the model will benefit elite agents with this new model each agent pays the same price for an impression based on what all agents are willing to spend in a market this transparent system benefits the best premier agent advertisers and is consistent with our strategy of focusing on elite agents who excel at lead conversion and provide great service to our home shoppers we continue to he see the nations best real estate agents those who convert leads at high rates gain transaction share in their respective markets as a result of advertising with zillow group while this change benefits higherperforming agents it also hurts other agents as such the number of premier agent advertisers on its platform declined on a yy basis management is making a bet that the benefit of having an auctionbased system will offset the decline in the number of agents willing to advertise on its platform one corollary benefit of this is that customers will be offered advertisements with more experienced and effective agents this could lead to more customer loyalty and drive consumer growth on the platform on the other hand by limiting the number of agents on the platform zillow is reducing the overall demand for ad space in the next few quarters we will have more information to determine if this change is inevitably beneficial or harmful to zillows business my take is that it will overall be a negative change i believe that initially higherperforming agents will be willing to pay more for these ads which will offset the declining demand from fewer overall agents selling ads on the platform however i think once these agents get a critical mass of deals though zillow they wont be reliant on the platform as wordofmouth is a prevalent method to get referred to an agent once an agent has a certain number of happy customers they can rely on those customers referring their friends and family to them at that point those agents can reduce their marketing expenditures on zillow of course this is just my theory and i could be wrong display advertising in addition to the marketplace advertising zillow generates revenue through display advertisements its display advertising primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or costperclick basis it offers customers display advertising opportunities on its mobile applications through display ads that are optimized for the mobile experience on its home page and on individual web pages through graphical displays and text links management has been less focused on this business segment and revenue has begun to decline from display advertising new construction  emerging marketplace in the earnings call management discussed this new marketplace and believed its total addressable market opportunity is  billion for this new segment this platform allows homebuilders to advertise their available lots and styles to the public builders can display realtime lot availability on search results and maps further builders will be able to receive information on consumer behavior in this platform this will enable them to assess local market conditions and determine user preferences helping them make decisions regarding their product positions land acquisition and how to improve their marketing efforts as this is a new platform it remains to be seen if builders will adopt using it competition zillow has two main competitors left after the acquisition of truliacom realtorcom and redfincom realtorcom was acquired by news corp nasdaqnws nasdaqnwsa and recently settled a lawsuit against zillow for  million the lawsuit regarded a dispute over trade secrets and executive poaching when it comes to availability and accuracy of data zillow doesnt compare to its competitors for the real estate sector the best information comes from multiple listing services mls sites an mls is a suite of services that real estate brokers use to establish contractual offers of compensation among brokers and accumulate and disseminate information to enable appraisals today through more than  mlss brokers share information on properties they have listed and invite other brokers to cooperate in their sale in exchange for compensation if they produce the buyer sellers benefit by increased exposure to their property buyers benefit because they can obtain information about all mlslisted properties while working with only one broker as the official site of the national association of realtors realtorcom receives listing data from more than  mlss this data is used to populate its consumerfacing home listing service which covers more than  of all mlss listed for sale properties moreover redfin is a broker so it is also able to access mlss to secure data for its listing website in contrast because zillow is not a broker it isnt able to receive such broad access to mlss as such zillow must rely on the expensive and complicated process of entering into separate agreements with multiple data providers this amalgamation of data collection can lead to less reliable data that can mislead its users and lead to them favoring the more reliable competitors in fact zillow lists this risk in its k as a risk factor when deals cannot be made zillow relies upon individual agents sharing their listings with zillow either manually or through internet data exchanges publicly available information or syndication partners our ability to attract users to our mobile applications websites and other tools depends to some degree on providing a robust number of current highquality forsale and rental listings to provide these listings we maintain relationships with real estate brokerages real estate listing aggregators multiple listing services property management companies home builders other thirdparty listing providers and homeowners and their real estate agents to include listing data in our services many of our agreements with real estate listing providers are shortterm agreements that may be terminated with limited notice the loss of existing relationships with listing providers whether due to termination of agreements or otherwise changes to our rights to use or timely access listing data or an inability to continue to add new listing providers may negatively impact our listing data quality this could reduce user confidence in the sale and rental data we provide and make us less popular with consumers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition by not having the most comprehensive database and by having to go through more expensive efforts to obtain its listing information zillow is at a serious disadvantage to its competitors competing for ad dollars zillow also faces competition for ad dollars from several other competitors specifically it competes with various real estate websites and applications local brokerage services general search engines and social media sites ie linkedin lnkd facebook nasdaqfb twitter nysetwtr and instagram additionally zillow faces competition for these ad dollars from traditional media operators such as newspapers tv magazines and homeapartment publications zillow did recently partner with facebook to offer a precisionad targeting program this program enables real estate agents to connect to facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or trulia which it recently acquired the technology identifies home shoppers or sellers who are using zillow or trulia and connects with them on facebook agents are able to feature a specific listing or highlight new listings for recently sold homes the company says the feature available on desktop and mobile is a chance to connect with shoppers and sellers on a social media platform that they are using every day although it will be beneficial for agents to get use of facebooks customer data there are two negative implications of this partnership first although we dont know the exact figures im sure zillow has to pay facebook a hefty amount for this targeted advertising which will eat into its margins moreover this underscores the risk that facebook represents at facebooks size there is just no way that zillow could compete with it if facebook decided to offer a similar platform i just dont see zillow having any real competitive advantage to thwart facebook from encroaching on its business recent performance in the latest quarter zillow reported revenue of  million increasing  yy which exceeded the high end of its guidance range the largest segment of its revenue came from its premier agent revenue which increased  yy to  million an important figure that was disclosed was that there was a  yy increase in the number of agent advertisers that spend more than  per month however the number of premier agent advertisers declined to  as its new auctionbased pricing model benefits the top performing agents as i discussed before now ill break down the other business segments other real estate revenue includes agent services streeteasy naked apartments rentals and its new construction portal increased  yy to  million mortgage revenue increased  yy to  million display revenue decreased  yy to  million overall zillow reported a gaap net loss of  million roughly  of revenue compared to a gaap net loss of  million about  of revenue in q  upon a cursory look zillows adjusted ebitda numbers appear to be trending in the right direction in this quarter zillow reported adjusted ebitda of  million about  of revenue which is a significant increase from last quarters  million about  of revenue however its adjusted ebitda figure isnt such an accurate measure of the true nature of its business zillows adjusted editda excludes stockbased compensation which is a significant figure for zillow in  zillow reported adjusted ebitda of  million but stockbased compensation was a staggering  million that means when including stockbased compensation it had an ebitda of just  million moreover when including the onetime litigation settlement with news corp zillow had  million in ebitda in  guidance management guided that it expects to exceed the  billion annual revenue mark in  and guided for revenue to be in the range of  billion the midpoint of this guidance represents a  yy increase in revenue it also guided for adjusted ebitda of between  million and  million the midpoint for this guidance represents  of revenue however that guidance excludes stockbased compensation which is expected to be between  million source zillow q press release finally the company guided for a net loss of between  million and  million this fullyear net loss would represent a vast improvement from s reported  million net loss even if you exclude the  million litigation settlement that marks a significant improvement other risks copyright infringement litigation with vht there is another notable litigation risk which was explained in its k in july  vht inc vht filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the western district of washington alleging copyright infringement of vhts images on the zillow digs site in january  vht filed an amended complaint alleging copyright infringement of vhts images on the zillow digs site as well as the zillow listing site in december  the court granted a motion for partial summary judgment that dismissed vhts claims with respect to the zillow listing site a federal jury trial began on january   that is expected to conclude in february  we have not recorded an accrual related to this complaint as of december   as we do not believe a loss is probable there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred however the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable streeteasy risk additionally there has been a lot of backlash from brokers when zillow rolled out its premier agent feature on streeteasy now brokers on streeteasy are concerned that buyers will be directed to thirdparty agents who have no connection to the property rather than to the listing agent with the exclusive this costs listing agents commissions forcing them to split with brokers who get leads simply because they pay streeteasy to be designated as a premier agent previously streeteasy generated revenue from featured listings and display advertisements this changed has led to the heads of some brokerage firms calling for a boycott of the platform and there has been discussion of a real estate board of new yorkfunded multiple listings service thats currently under development as a backend platform for brokers to become a consumerfacing alternative to streeteasy nonetheless although this threat is a risk worth mentioning its implications are relatively limited as the revenue from streeteasy is lumped together into a category with naked apartments rentals and new construction and in the aggregate that category only generated roughly  million last quarter notable negatives reliance on sales teams our sales teams are responsible for generating advertising customers across our mobile applications and websites our largest sales teams sell our premier agent products to real estate agents and are located in seattle washington denver colorado and irvine california we also have sales teams in seattle washington and denver colorado that sell our rental products to rental professionals in addition we have sales teams in seattle washington new york new york and lincoln nebraska that support sales in our mortgage marketplaces and display advertising we attract customers through a combination of outbound calling and inbound customer requests generated from our websites and event marketing activities we also maintain a field sales team in san francisco california and new york new york to specifically target larger advertising customers in the real estate and related content categories such as real estate brokerages home builders lenders and home service providers as well as advertisers in the telecommunications automotive insurance and other industries relying on a sales team to sell ads to real estate agents does not bode well for zillows scalability sales teams are expensive and zillow has not shown its ability to retain these real estate agents on the platform for the long term it did increase the number of advertisers spending more than  per month by more than  yy in the last quarter however it is shedding the total number of agent advertisers to do so as it makes advertising on the platform more expensive for lesseffective agents i believe that these top agents will hit a critical mass of customers and will be able to rely on wordofmouth advertising to sustain their business and thus stop their marketing efforts on zillow if this process occurs there will be significant churn in terms of agent advertisers on the platform and zillow will not be able to end its reliance on an expensive sales team moreover with the best agents leaving the platform zillows ad costs will face a cap convertible notes in december  the company issued  million in  convertible senior notes due in  the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of  per year payable semiannually but can be converted into zillows class c stock the conversion rate is  per share so these very longdated convertible notes can be quite dilutive and limit the upside beyond the conversion price positives percentage of online real estate market according to comscore zillow groups brands represent nearly three quarters of market share of all mobile exclusive visitors to the real estate category moreover the majority of its traffic comes directly and is not dependent on search engines which shows that zillow groups brands have strong customer recognition and loyalty moreover its traffic continues to expand during the three months ended december   traffic to its consumer brands zillow trulia streeteasy hotpads and naked apartments grew to  million average monthly unique users an increase of  compared to the three months ended december   although these figures are positive i dont see how zillow can thwart off competition management is investing in its brand to generate customer loyalty but there really is nothing to stop competitors from offering a similar product facebook could easily enter and dominant this space moreover with an expensive and sometimes inaccurate method to get listings onto its site zillow faces a risk in offering customers a smaller selection of houses and apartments to sort though as compared to its competitors market opportunity according to data published by the national association of realtors in  approximately  million existing and  new homes in the us were sold for an aggregate transaction value of approximately  trillion us real estate agents and brokers spent an estimated  billion on residential advertising in  according to data compiled from borrell associates its full report is behind a paywall moreover the same report from borrell associates found that us real estate developers spent an estimated  billion on residential advertising in  for the rental market borrell associates estimated that  billion was spent on advertising rental properties in  moreover it estimated that us residential mortgage providers spent approximately  billion on marketing their services and loan products to mortgage borrowers during the earnings call management discussed how it believes the opportunity in front of them remains massive to give an indication of its future growth opportunity management used an estimate that in  there were approximately  billion in total real estate commissions in the us of that commission revenue it earned  million in premier agent revenue and delivered nearly  million leads to premier agents it further estimated that those leads earned about  billion in commissions which represents roughly  of all commissions in the us management said its leads represent a small percentage of the total but was bullish about its ability to grow that percentage and cited solid growth from last year in  it generated  million leads or  of us commissions furthermore it is worth noting that the housing market may face a boon from millennials moving out of their parents house in the next few years the share of millennials that are living with their parents has been growing at a prodigious rate and is now over  source zillow presentation net operating loss carryforwards as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  million state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  million and net tax credit carryforwards of approximately  million it is notable to mention that if zillow is acquired the acquirer will have not have the use of these tax loss carryforwards since it will be an ownership change under sections  and  of the internal revenue code which will limit the acquirers use of them however if zillow does eventually become profitable it can use these to offset its taxable income valuation there is no direct competitor to compare zillow against so i found a peer group that i believe provides a good comparison each of these companies runs a platform with a similar type of business model to zillow the comparable companies ive identified are expedia nasdaqexpe yelp nyseyelp and tripadvisor nasdaqtrip on a relative basis i believe zillow is overvalued its pricetosales ratio is around double every other competitors now you may think that is due to zillow possibly having a much higher growth rate however that just isnt the case as shown by the second chart below zillows quarterly revenue growth is not much higher than expedias or yelps furthermore each other company in peer group is currently profitable while zillow is not as shown by the third chart below zg ps ratio annual data by ycharts z revenue quarterly yoy growth data by ycharts z profit margin quarterly data by ycharts now some may argue that zillow is investing in the future by growing its brand and generating a mass of users before focusing on profitability however i do not believe it is creating any sort of competitive advantage moreover its reliance on an amalgamation of services to get listings is a significant risk that can completely upend its business further i dont see it thwarting off facebook if it decides to enter this market zillow just does not have any way to compete with the depth and breadth of facebooks collection of user data final remarks i believe caledonia was way too optimistic in its evaluation of zillow although i believe zillow is operating in a growing market i believe there are too many risks to justify its current valuation and it is certainly not going to increase x its current level as caledonias analysis suggested disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned

range of publicly available information including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood according to zillow the zestimate is a starting point in determining a homes value the accuracy of the zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available but zillow allows users to check the accuracy of zestimates in their own region against actual

historical zestimate value information dating back to  critique of zestimate accuracyedit in  the wall street journal studied the accuracy of zillows estimates and found that they often are very good frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid but when zillow is bad it can be terrible in october  the national community reinvestment coalition filed a complaint with the federal trade commission stating that zillow was intentionally misleading consumers and realestate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation automated valuation model avm mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading in a letter dated may   the ftc elected not to investigate this complaint which was later withdrawn by the ncrccitation needed real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home room flow landscaping views traffic noise and privacy these factors have been called unzillowables a term coined in the real estate blogospherecitation needed using data published on the zillow website the typical zestimate error in the united states in july  was  controversy and lawsuitsedit while factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation this method may not be unique to zillow but unduly distorts value expectations listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical zillow estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage but where the home might be decades older condition age of home special features proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate but these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable in  zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the zillow operation in irvine california alleging violations of california labor code and california business and professions code on february   the us district court for the central district of california certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at zillow between november  and january  among the numerous allegations brought by highprofile attorneys bobby samini and mark geragos zillow is accused of failing to pay wages failing to pay overtime pay and failing to provide meal and rest breaks zillow responded that the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with zillowthe behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the  zillow employees in addition samini and geragos represented a former zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company alleging sexual torture and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable” according to the lawsuit zillows southern california office represents
