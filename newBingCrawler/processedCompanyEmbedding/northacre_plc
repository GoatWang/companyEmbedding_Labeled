northacre plc  december     december  northacre plc northacre or the company   proposed cancellation of admission to trading on aim and notice of general meeting   northacre plc aim nta announces that as a result of a review of the benefits and drawbacks of being a quoted company the board has concluded that the cancellation of admission of its ordinary shares to trading on aim cancellation is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole   the company therefore announces its intention to seek its shareholders approval for the cancellation  an explanatory circular will be posted to shareholders today the circular setting out the background to and reasons for the cancellation the reasons why the directors believe that this is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole and their recommendation to shareholders to vote in favour of the resolution to approve the cancellation the resolution   a general meeting of the company will be held at the companys registered office at  pm on wednesday  january  at the companys registered office at  albion riverside  hester road london sw ax at which the resolution will be proposed to shareholders for approval a notice convening the general meeting is set out in the circular which will shortly also be available on the companys website wwwnorthacrecom   the company has received an irrevocable undertaking from the companys major shareholder spadille limited to vote in favour of the resolution for  ordinary shares in aggregate representing approximately  per cent of the issued share capital of the company   in addition spadille limited has advised the company that it will today give an order to purchase ordinary shares in the market at a price of  pence per ordinary share such order will remain open until the companys last trading day on aim being wednesday  january  unless the order is fulfilled in advance of this date shareholders should consult with their own independent financial adviser andor broker should they wish to consider selling their interests in the market prior to the cancellation becoming effective   subject to the resolution being passed at the general meeting the expected last day of dealings in ordinary shares on aim will be wednesday  january  and the cancellation will become effective at  am on thursday  january  pursuant to rule  of the aim rules the company through its nominated adviser finncap limited has notified the london stock exchange of the proposed cancellation   further information regarding the background to and principal effects of the cancellation is set out below   for further information please contact   northacre plc   klas nilsson nonexecutive chairman      niccolò barattieri di san pietro chief executive officer finncap ltd nominated adviser  broker   corporate finance  stuart andrewscarl holmes      the information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article  of the market abuse regulation eu no      background and reasons for cancellation   the board has conducted a review of the advantages and disadvantages to the company and its shareholders in retaining its quotation on aim and believes that the cancellation is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole in reaching this conclusion the board has considered the following key factors   •        the considerable cost management time and the legal and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the companys admission to trading on aim which in the directors opinion are  disproportionate to the benefits to the company   •        as at the date of this announcement the major shareholder holds in total  per cent of the companys current issued share capital and as a result the free float and liquidity of the ordinary shares is significantly limited   •        the aim listing of the ordinary shares does not in itself offer investors the opportunity to trade in meaningful volumes or with any frequency within an active market with little trading volume the companys share price can move up or down significantly following trades of small numbers of shares and   •        due to the companys limited liquidity in its shares and in practical terms a small free float and market capitalisation continuing admission to trading on aim no longer sufficiently provides the company with the advantages of providing access to capital or enabling the ordinary shares to be used to effect acquisitions   following careful consideration the board believes that it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole to seek the cancellation at the earliest opportunity     process for and principal effects of the cancellation   the directors are aware that certain shareholders may be unable or unwilling to hold ordinary shares in the event that the cancellation is approved and becomes effective such shareholders should consider selling their interests in the market prior to the cancellation becoming effective   under the aim rules the company is required to give at least  business days notice of the cancellation additionally the cancellation will not take effect until at least  clear business days have passed following the passing of the resolution if the resolution is passed at the general meeting it is proposed that the last day of trading in ordinary shares on aim will be  january  and the cancellation will take effect at  am on  january    the principal effects of the cancellation will be that   •        there will be no formal market mechanism enabling the shareholders to trade ordinary shares and furthermore no other recognised market or trading facility  will be available to enable trading of the ordinary shares however in order to mitigate the impact of the loss of liquidity following the cancellation the company will consider setting up a matched bargain facility as a trading mechanism for the ordinary shares see paragraph  below   •        while the ordinary shares will remain freely transferrable it is possible that following the cancellation the liquidity and marketability of the ordinary shares may be significantly reduced and the value of such shares may be adversely affected as a consequence   •        it may be more difficult for shareholders to determine the market value of their investment in the company at any given time   •        the regulatory and financial reporting regime applicable to companies whose shares are admitted to trading on aim will no longer apply   •        shareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the aim rules including the requirement to be notified of certain events and otherwise in relation to substantial transactions reverse takeovers related party transactions and fundamental changes in the companys business   •        the levels of transparency and corporate governance within the company are unlikely to be as stringent as for a company quoted on aim   •        the company will cease to have an independent nominated adviser and broker and     •        the cancellation may have taxation consequences for shareholders shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax adviser   the company will remain subject to the  act  shareholders should also note that the takeover code will continue to apply to the company following the cancellation for the period of  years from the date of cancellation the company will also continue to be bound by the articles which requires shareholder approval for certain matters following the cancellation the company may however seek shareholder approval in the future to amend the articles so as to reflect the companys change from listed to unlisted status   the above considerations are nonexhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice when assessing the likely impact of the cancellation on them   following the cancellation the company will   •        continue to communicate information about the company to its shareholders and to hold annual general meetings in each case as required by law and   •        continue to maintain its website httpwwwnorthacrecom and to post updates on the website from time to time  although shareholders should be aware that there will be no obligation on the company to include all of the information required under aim rule  or to update the website as required by the aim rules     transaction in the ordinary shares prior to and following the proposed cancellation        prior to the cancellation   the major shareholder has advised the company that it has today made an order to purchase ordinary shares in the market at a price of  pence per ordinary share being a  per cent premium to the closing midmarket price on the day prior to the publication of this announcement such order will remain open until the last trading day of the ordinary shares on aim being  january  unless the order is fulfilled in advance of this date shareholders should consult with their own independent financial adviser and  or broker should they wish to consider selling their interests in the company prior to the cancellation becoming effective        following the cancellation   the board is aware that the cancellation should it be approved by shareholders at the general meeting would make it more difficult for shareholders to buy and sell ordinary shares should they wish to do so   following cancellation and depending on the number of shareholders remaining after the cancellation becomes effective the company will consider putting in place a matched bargain facility to assist shareholders to trade in the ordinary shares if implemented the matched bargain facility would be made available either directly through the company or through a third party provider under the matched bargain facility shareholders or persons wishing to acquire or dispose of ordinary shares would be able to leave an indication with the matched bargain facility provider that they are prepared to buy or sell at an agreed price in the event that the matched bargain facility provider is able to match that order with an opposite sell or buy instruction the matched bargain facility provider would contact both parties and then effect the bargain should the company put in place a matched bargain facility details will be made available to shareholders on the companys website at httpwwwnorthacrecom  and directly by letter or email where appropriate   as the major shareholder already has an interest in over  per cent of the issued share capital of the company the purchase of ordinary shares by the major shareholder whether prior to the proposed cancellation or afterwards will not have any consequences under the takeover code     current trading and strategy   the company released its interim results for the six months ending  june  on  september  in them the company noted that even though the brexit vote has brought some further uncertainty to the highend housing market the board made the point that in this uncertain market northacre is fully committed to delivering the most desirable and beautifully crafted homes in addition the board strongly believe that the flight to quality will become apparent in the short to medium term and that quality will be rewarded with premium exit values   what is more the board considers that the strength of the us dollar towards the sterling makes london a much more attractive market for us dollar denominated or pegged buyers and the company has seen this borne out in the recent viewings   northacre is continuing its work on two significant projects  palace street and the broadway following the cancellation the company will continue with this strategy which for the purpose of clarity is to strengthen its position as developer of choice for highend residential or residentiallyled developments in central london   it should be noted that the construction market in central london is still experiencing significant constraints hence construction costs are squeezing profit margins the board expects this to slightly subside from the second half of  onwards     irrevocable undertaking   the company has received an irrevocable undertaking from the major shareholder to vote in favour of the resolution in respect of  ordinary shares representing approximately  per cent of the issued share capital of the company as at the date of this announcement     process for cancellation   under the aim rules it is a requirement that the cancellation must be approved by not less than  per cent of votes cast by shareholders at a general meeting accordingly the notice of general meeting set out in part ii of the circular contains a special resolution to approve the cancellation   furthermore rule  of the aim rules requires an aim company to notify shareholders and to separately inform the london stock exchange of its preferred cancellation date at least  business days prior to such date  in accordance with aim rule  the directors have notified aim of the companys intention subject to the resolution being passed at the general meeting to cancel the companys admission of the ordinary shares to trading on aim on  january   accordingly if the resolution is passed at the general meeting the cancellation will be effective at  am on  january      general meeting   the general meeting will be held at  albion riverside  hester road london sw ax commencing at  pm on  january  if approved it is expected that the cancellation will take effect from  am on  january    if the cancellation becomes effective finncap ltd will cease to be nominated adviser of the company and the company will no longer be required to comply with the aim rules     recommendation   the directors consider that the cancellation is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders
