attributed to each link theres no exact number of links to include on a page but best practice is to keep it under using the nofollow attribute in your links prevents some link juice but these links

sitemaps contain the list of your urls that are available to index and allow the search engines to read your pages more intelligently they can also include information like your site’s latest updates frequency of changes and the importance of urlsbe sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl so leave out any that have been blocked in a robotstxt file avoid using any urls that cause redirects or error codes and be sure to be consistent in using your preferred urls with or without www correct protocols http vs https and trailing slashes you should also use your robotstxt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap add and optimize your xml sitemap url parameters perfect your urls look clean  url parameters are used to track user behaviors on site session ids traffic sources referrer ids or to give users control over the content on the page sorting and filtering the issue with url parameters is that google sees each unique parameter value as a new url hosting the same thing  meaning you could have a duplicate content problem sometimes it’s able to recognize these urls and group them together it then algorithmically decides which url is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results you can help google recognize the best url by using the rel”canonical” taguse the url parameters tool in google search console to tell google how your url parameters affect page content and how to to crawl urls with parameters use this tool very carefully  you can easily prevent google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings especially if you have urls with multiple parameters rewrite your urls and clean them up  underscores in the urls low
