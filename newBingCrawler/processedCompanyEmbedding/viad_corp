public company incorporated  as motor transit corp employees  sales  million  stock exchanges new york ticker symbol vvi naic  convention and trade show organizers viad corp is a phoenix arizonabased descendant of the greyhound bus line the publicly traded company is primarily engaged in providing services for trade shows conventions and special events subsidiary ges exposition services inc offers

dismantle trade show exhibitions and provides exhibitor show program management services to a lesser degree viad is also involved in the travel and recreation field brewsters tours inc offers travel services to attractions in the canadian rocky mountains such as the columbia icefield and banff gondola a fourth viad subsidiary glacier park inc is the principal concessionaire in montanas glacier park operating four lodges and three motor inns in the area s roots viads greyhound corporate lineage dates to  when motor transit corp was formed to provide bus service and become a consolidator in the young industry in  the company changed its name to greyhound corp then survived the great depression of the s and emerged as the countrys premiere bus line but as business began to tail off in the s the company under the leadership of gerald h trautman began to diversify into a wide range of businesses and refashioned itself as a conglomerate in  greyhound became involved in equipment leasing through the acquisition of boothe leasing corp two years later it turned to food services picking up prophet co renamed greyhound food management inc in  greyhound added financial services to the mix acquiring travelers express co inc which processed money orders greyhound acquired carey transportation inc and  percent of nassau air dispatch in  to provide ground support to airlines serving the bahamas this business was then supplemented by the addition of freeport flight services the most significant move greyhound made to diversify was the   million acquisition of chicagobased armour  company the famous meatpacker founded in the s however  years later the company faced a hostile takeover bid by general host corp and convinced the greyhound board to act as a white knight after some legal wrangling general host sold its armour stock to greyhound which acquired the rest of the company as well greyhound then unloaded much of armours assets retaining the meatpacking business renamed armour foods and the consumer productions division armourdial dial soap had been part of the armour company since  when its researchers used the packing operations tallow byproduct to develop a new germicidal deodorant soap in the s dial adopted the advertising slogan arent you glad you use dial dont you wish everybody did which proved instrumental in dial emerging as the leading deodorant soap in the country so enduring was the slogan that dial employed it for the next  years on some levels trautman had assembled a successful conglomerate but the company was not embraced by wall street which derisively referred to greyhound as the dog its earnings were erratic up one year and down the next and instead of viewing greyhound as diversified analysts criticized it for lacking focus in  a new chairman and chief executive officer john w teets was brought in to overhaul greyhound when his work was completed  years later he would emerge as the chairman and ceo of viad corp teets grew up in chicago in a blue collar home the son of a crane operator who later started his own construction company an indifferent student teets was uninterested in becoming a civil engineer as his father desired instead finding himself drawn to the restaurant business in his early s with backing from his father teets bought an interest in the winter garden a chicago complex that included a shopping center restaurant and ice skating rink the venture proved highly successful and teets may have likely remained involved in this field and never worked for greyhound had it not been for a string of tragedies that struck his life in  first his wife died in her sleep from unknown causes followed a few weeks later by the death of a brother from a gas leak on the job finally in november of that year the winter garden was completely destroyed by fire teets was in total despair and it was only at the insistence of a close friend that he applied for a food management job that greyhound was advertising he was hired to run the greyhound restaurants at the  new york worlds fair and performed so well at the task that greyhound made him president of posts houses a bus terminal restaurant operator after a few years teets left greyhound for stints with other restaurant operations including canteen corp where he worked for a taskmaster and conglomerate wizard harold geneen who taught him the importance of being detailoriented and how to squeeze the utmost from managers in  a much more seasoned teets returned to greyhound lured back by trautman to take over the struggling food service group with geneen as his model teets whipped the subsidiary into shape and became heir to trautmans top post teets told fortune in  that trautman wasnt much of a tire kicker and that greyhound was run with benign neglect all that changed when teets took charge in  insisting that all subsidiaries had to return at least  percent on equity he was especially hard on the bus lines and meatpacking units which fell far short of that mark he moved aggressively to take on the unions demanding wage cuts from workers at armour foods and when they refused he shuttered the companys  plants and sold the business to conagra inc which in days reopened with thousands of nonunion workers teets then turned his attention to his unionized bus drivers which greyhound paid at a much higher rate than the competition his demand for a  percent wage and benefit cut resulted in a day strike marred by violence in the end he achieved a  percent giveback but greyhound had been severely hurt and despite a number of costcutting measures never fully recovered in  teets sold the greyhound bus company to dallas investors for  million although the company retained the greyhound corp name while casting off major assets teets added to existing businesses in  the consumer products division acquired ellios pizza and purex corp maker of soap bleach and other household products that filled in gaps in greyhounds product lines a year later greyhound acquired carson pirie scott  cos inflight catering and airport terminal concession business the  mule team division of united states borax  chemical corp and its household products were brought into the fold in  the addition of republic money orders inc added to the financial services area in  greyhound acquired the breck hair care products business in that same year the company changed its name to greyhounddial in the hopes of creating some distance from its erstwhile bus line while still providing a connection to the ten subsidiaries such as greyhound exhibit group that continued to carry the greyhound name the distinction was lost on the public however as people continued to call the corporate switchboard with bus route and fare questions less than a year later in february  the company adopted a less confusing name the dial corp teets undertook a further restructuring of dial in  creating a spinoff company—gfc financial corp later taking the name of finova capital corp—composed of greyhound financial corp greyhound european financial group and verex corp the result was that a lot of hidden value was unlocked in these assets and finova enjoyed strong growth prompting investors to clamor for even more streamlining in dial convinced there was additional unrealized wealth in the remaining assets split between consumer products and service companies unlike finova dial was only able to achieve growth through further acquisitions teets resisted the idea of further divestiture until  when michael price of heine securities began accumulating a significant stake in dial which for years had been trading in the  range but had an estimated breakup value around  in a proactive move teets announced that dial would be split into two publicly held companies with consumer products and the service assets going their separate ways the consumer products side kept the dial name while the service companies inherited the corporate entity that was once greyhound corp and took a new name viad corp it also retained teets as chairman and ceo if only for a brief period he announced plans to retire at the start of  while at the same time naming his handpicked successor robert h bohannon the yearold head of the travelers express subsidiary bohannon also brought  years of experience at general electrics financial

for teets bohannon began to refine viads business mix shedding some assets while adding others in  viad cast off aircraft services international group and the dutyfree business then a year later sold restaura and dobbs international services during this period the company bolstered travelers express with the  million acquisition of game financial corporation providing patrons of casinos and other gaming establishments with cash through credit card advance and check cashing services and automated teller machines in june  travelers express paid  million to acquire moneygram payment systems inc a nonbank provider of consumer wiretransfer services which complemented travelers expresss money order business exhibitgroupgiltspur also grew externally acquiring dimension works in november  just one in a series of acquisitions that commenced before the creation of viad corp and resulted in the largest exhibition company in the world headed by charles corsentino the dial subsidiary exhibitgroup began its growth spurt in  with the acquisition of its top competitor giltspur with both companies generating about  million in annual sales in addition in  the company added all west display and displaymasters  deaton the acquisition of color  design exhibits followed in july  then in  tl horton germanys volbo innenausbau and dimension works were brought into the fold of the worlds largest fullservice exhibition company maintaining offices in  cities in the united states as well as toronto canada and dusseldorf germany by the new century viad was involved in two primary areas payment services and convention and event services revenues totaled more than  billion in  yielding net income of  million both business segments enjoyed solid growth in  a  percent increase for payment services and  percent for convention and event services however events outside the companys control intervened in  and adversely affected viads fortunes while payment services added nearly  million in sales for the year convention and event services experienced a  percent drop in revenues due to a sagging economy which caused some convention customers to forgo building new exhibits and the terrorist attacks of september  leading to travel concerns and the cancellation of some trade shows and exhibit orders difficult conditions continued in  as viads total revenues decreased  percent to  billion and net income slipped to  million again payment services held steady increasing revenues by  percent but the convention and event services sales declined by another  percent in  payment services was adversely impacted by lower interest rates and widespread mortgage refinancing that resulted in the segment growing at a modest  percent clip convention and event services lost another  percent in sales although it was able to produce profitable results in spite of a shrinking marketplace for trade shows and conventions it had become clear to investors and management alike that viads two principal business segments were hardly capable of achieving synergy as had been true during the greyhound and dial days the assets were building up unrealized value that could hopefully be unlocked by splitting the two segments into separate companies in  viad began the process of engineering a reverse taxfree spinoff of the payment services unit thus a new subsidiary was formed moneygram international inc which early in  received the payment services business and its stock was distributed to viad stockholders viad then conducted a oneforfour reverse stock split to increase the price of viad shares for the year continuing operations generated  million in revenues the company that had once been involved in buses meat soap and money orders was now focused almost entirely on the trade show and convention business given its size and breadth there was every reason to expect that with a rebounding economy viad was well positioned to enjoy success in its chosen field
