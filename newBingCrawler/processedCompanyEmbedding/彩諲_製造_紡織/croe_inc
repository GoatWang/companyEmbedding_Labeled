our competitive position leading to a possible loss of customers or a decrease in prices either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits our competitors are numerous ranging from large multinational corporations which have significantly greater capital resources than us to relatively small and specialized firms we also compete with the major manufacturers our business could be adversely affected because of increased competition from these athletic apparel companies  the fitness apparel industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control including the timely development and introduction of our fitness clothing and its enhancements its functionality performance reliability customer service and support and marketing efforts due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the textiles market we expect additional competition from other emerging companies many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources as a result they may be able to respond more quickly to fashion changes and have greater resources for the development and promotion of their products there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition company description we were incorporated in the state of utah on december   to engage in the development and sale of womens fitness clothing  our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities which include i formation of the company ii development of our

extremely thin silver coated copper wires are spun with cotton or polyester yarns then woven into washable comfortable and durable fabrics with the look and feel of normal fabric the fabrics we are testing materials to use for the croenest have the following characteristics · ecological cotton fabric without chemicals · contain no harmful substances · independently tested for shielding

raw materials  cotton  copper  silver · attenuation  db at  ghz · color ecruwhite · weight  gm² · dimension stability   we have also found a light weight water resistant material to add to our croenest to keep your phone dry while you sweatthe finalization of the croenest does not require any more capital to develop it will require additional capital to incorporate the croenest into the design of our sports bras and other products we have developed six different prototypes of sportsbras with the croenest we have tested our sports bras by having friends and family wear the bras while exercising three times a week washing the bras after every use testing the durability of the croenest material with a radio sensor device and getting feedback the feedback has included comfort level accessibility of the cell phone while workingout water resistant satisfaction and durability we are satisfied with the croenest exactly as we have developed it we are still trying to find the proper materials and manufacturer for the other parts of our sportsbras shorts and yoga pants we plan to develop our croe brand to be functional and protective our team plans to develop a product that every runner cyclist and active person may want our plan for bringing this product to the national and international retail distribution market is fivefold · acquire investment capital to design and manufacture our fitness apparel · create a systematic duplicable process within our business for inventory management and order fulfillment · utilize an aggressive marketing platform including sales
