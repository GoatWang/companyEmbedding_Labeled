in the accompanying financial statements the company has incurred an accumulated deficit of  for the period from inception june   to december   the company has not generated revenue as the business operations have been focused on developing our business plan and market research this raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern overview the following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k the following information specifies forward looking statements that anticipate our business plan estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those contemplated in those forward looking statements description of business general information we have yet to commence planned operations to any significant measure as of the date of this annual report we have had only limited startup operations and have not generated revenues we will not be profitable until we derive sufficient revenues and cash flows from sales of silicon energy clothing products our administrative office is located at f no  songshan rd xinyi district taipei city  taiwan republic of china our fiscal year ends on is december  as of the date of this annual report we have not sold any silicon energy clothing nor have we generated any revenue from operations we are a development stage company located in taipei city taiwan we plan to market and distribute in taiwan silica energy clothing manufactured by shinin silica corp a taiwanese corporation shinin generally that clothing consists of mens and womens undergarments and related apparel that clothing is made from an energy silicon fiber and yarn made from a fine nanoscale silicon powder and polymer materials which together result in a reactive energy material additionally that clothing is biodegradable and quickdrying we believe that we will be successful in selling high quality silica energy clothing products at economical prices because we plan to buy the product directly from shinin at discounted prices we plan to enter into agreements with clothing product suppliers and retailers in taiwan such as specialty stores and department stores by moving those silica energy clothing products directly from shinin to the supplier andor retailer we are able to avoid the costs and fees associated with housing and storing those silica energy clothing products which will result in more profit for us and better prices for our customers table of contents our sole officer and director hsuanhsien liao has experience in the silica energy clothing product industry she possesses strong sales and management experience and these skills are a valuable asset to the company we plan to contact and begin negotiating agreements with potential customers by entering into purchase agreements with suppliers and retailers of clothing products going concern the company has incurred losses to date the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern for the period ended december   the company had limited operations as of december   the company has not emerged from the development stage in view of these matters the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its planned business the company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from a loan commitment of  from hsuanhsien liao our president and sole director which commitment is for  months and all amounts lent by ms liao pursuant to that commitment shall not accrue interest and shall be payable on demand provided however such demand will not be made prior to the expiration of that  month period after the date of that commitment which date is march   as of december   the amount owed to ms liao pursuant to that commitment was  that funding commitment will terminate on march   ms liao has extended that commitment for an additional month period on the same terms and subject to the same conditions the financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company has incurred an accumulated deficit of  for the period from inception june   to december   these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less net income loss per share basic income loss per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period diluted income per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period at december   the company does not have any outstanding common stock equivalents therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes which requires that the company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse deferred income tax benefit expense results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities a valuation allowance is recorded when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized recent accounting pronouncements the company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its result of operations financial position or cash flow results of operations the following presents the results of the company for the year ended december   and for the year

 the change in the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss incurred during that year ended december   the increases in other receivables and prepaid expenses and the decrease in accrued expenses were partially offset by the increase in the amount due to related parties for working capital purposes net cash flow provided by financing activities was  for the

haha generations comment on competitors and industry peers there are many barriers of entry in the clothing market and the level of competition is extremely high examples of barriers of entry in this market include brand loyalty aggressive lower pricing tactics and economies of scale many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their clothing products to shinin’s aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to enter and compete in this market economies of scale make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of clothing products which would leave us at a disadvantage the principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality of our products we will be in a market where we will be in direct competition with many domestic and international companies offering competing products many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies may have a greater and more established customer base than us we will likely lose prospective business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for competing products than us which may also cause us to lose prospective business we also foresee challenges facing new market entrants we may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we have not yet entered the market once we enter the market we will be one of many participants in the business of distributing clothing products many established and wellfinanced entities are currently active in the business of distributing such products nearly all of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us we are consequently at a competitive disadvantage in the market therefore we may not be able to establish ourselves within the industry    see the full list of haha competitors
