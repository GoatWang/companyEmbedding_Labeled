europepolicystudy  policy study n macedonian clothes for europe   i introduction   this is an analysis of development problems in a former socialist country in south eastern europe it is also a story about life in stip a mediumsized town in eastern macedonia the emergence of a new group of private entrepreneurs on the ruins of formerly socialist companies and the policy responses to the emerging new economy by public institutions the story explores the forces that have affected the people and economy of stip in the past and the factors which are buffeting them today examining and investigating those forces and factors is crucial for anybody who wants to understand the current socioeconomic situation of macedonia as stip is traditionally the biggest center of clothing and textile production in macedonia this study is important for understanding the overall situation in this sector in this study we aim to explore what is the state of affairs of the textile and apparel industry is there a need for modernization and transformation to make it one of the economic driving forces of the country  stip  due to its historical and regional importance for the textile production  shall be used as a case study for this sector   the story of stip is also vital for any policy maker who considers which measures and public policies might be effective for breaking out of a cycle of stagnation and decline the analysis of the changes in the clothing sector in stip offers a solid basis for understanding the transformation of other industries in macedonia in search for a more focused approach to problems of the macedonian economy picturing stip and its overdominant industrial sector – textile and clothing industry provides an extremely useful tool for more comprehensive understanding of the current economic problems of the country and for considering the possible solutions of the crisis this report helps to explain the universal and specific reasons making macedonia one of the slowest growing transition economies   today the macedonian “transition” from socialism to a market economy is largely completed however the results of the transformation have been disappointing the country’s gdp growth has been slowest in the region   gdp real change in  against previous year   country  year       forecast albania       bosnia       bulgaria       croatia       macedonia       romania       serbia       montenegro         in addition macedonia has a very high unemployment its official rate of unemployment is highest in southeast europe worse than bosnia and herzegovina and serbia excluding kosovo the percentage of macedonians of working age  who are employed is  compared to  in turkey  in poland or  in germany macedonia rates  among  economies that are surveyed annually for the purposes of “doing business report” of the world bank   poorly functioning institutions and dysfunctional courts have undermined business activity and kept per capita foreign direct investments low even by regional standards the foreign investments in macedonia are lowest in the southeast of europe lagging well behind neighboring bulgaria albania and serbia   foreign direct investments in south east europe in million euros   country  year       per capita inflow  albania        bosnia        bulgaria        croatia        macedonia        romania        serbia        montenegro            growth and reform strategies should not be based on abstract values but mainly on concrete figures obtained directly from field research that is the only way to elaborate policy tailored to the real needs and to develop practically applicable economic strategies the objective of this paper is to shed light on some of the structural problems facing macedonia that might help explain its stubbornly high unemployment rate and low level of growth and exports  it does so by looking both at a crucial sector clothes or apparel production and at trends in one of macedonia’s seven regions eastern macedonia  this sector is crucial for bread winner both in terms of exports and employment every second item macedonia sells to the eu is a shirt blouse or another piece of clothing in  clothing and textile exports made up  percent of all of macedonia exports and  percent of its exports to the eu in  significantly more than the ‘traditional’ macedonian exports of raw tobacco  wine  and lamb   exports of iron and steel contribute a further  percent in fact apparel and iron exports combined make up two thirds of the country’s exports developments in these key sectors directly and strongly affect all of macedonian society as they contribute to two thirds of the country’s exports             table  macedonia’s top exports by commodity group million us m                                      clothing      iron  steel      beverages  tobacco      food products      machinery  transport equipment      chemicals      textiles      total        note figures as in source components may not sum to the total given   in terms of employment clothing manufacturing today is the biggest industrial sector almost one in ten officially employed macedonians today produce clothes  percent the industry employs  people nearly one third of the total number of employees in the macedonian industrial sector it has more than a double of the workers in the manufacture of food products and beverages  and far more than the  employees in the production of metal products  this is true even though the number has been in decline since the late s when there were  employees   women’s blouses and cotton tshirts are the most competitive products produced in macedonia today the women’s blouse was the number one macedonian export product in the first trimester of  on the list of the top  most valuable export items were also men’s cotton shirts in the fourth and women’s trousers and brace overalls in the eight place macedonia actually earns more selling women’s blouses than with the sales of its wine and lamb combined and these items are just one kind of apparel exported by the domestic producers exports of blouses sewn for ca are worth more than the sales of the famous t‘ga za jug longing for the south macedonian red wine   the center of the clothing production in macedonia today is in eastern macedonia in stip there  or  percent of all employed work in  companies in the textile sector  this is more than in any other town in the country skopje has  tetovo  and bitola  people working in this sector in the rest of eastern macedonia textiles and clothing are also major employers in the small town of radovish where the economy in socialist time was concentrated around the copper mine buchim today there are several textile companies such as koneli dekorteks edinstvo branches of stipteks from stip and orka from skopje” in vinica there are  vinka and vinichanka built in socialist times but also new clothing companies such as moda in kochani ko stil goldenteks triko amorteks and daniteks the town of delchevo was also textile oriented today besides the old alkaloid and frotirka several new clothing companies such as palteks and dateks have been opened   outsiders looking at macedonia rarely pay much attention to its east north west and north east macedonia are in the focus due to their complex ethnic relations here most of the country’s albanians live  the capital skopje is the political and economic centre with  percent of the total population producing  percent of the country’s gdp  even central macedonia – the valley of the vardar river – is familiar to those who travel from central europe to the aegean from belgrade to thessaloniki  eastern macedonia however sees few visitors the population is largely monoethnic the landscape unspectacular people in this region have the worst living standards in macedonia they are less prosperous than those in skopje but also than citizens of tetovo or kumanovo    can a city whose economy depends on textiles and clothes be anything other than poor  can a region where the typical worker is a woman with primary school education sewing and stitching pieces of imported cloth with the help of oldfashioned sewing machines truly develop  some in stip doubt this  “a town with so many clothing companies must be poor” explains vlado netkov who now runs one of the most entrepreneurial businesses in stip yet most of the private companies crpm interviewed in recent months have expanded their activities since   in the short term then the sector appears to be doing fine however in the clothes sector the short term is short indeed it is alarming that today as in the socialist past the simple “sewing and stitching” remains the main economic activity in the town investments in higher valueadded production are hardly evident which brings the danger of stip being destined for further stagnation precisely because stip is so “clothing manufacturing dependant” if this sector fails the city itself would collapse as well whereas in other macedonian municipalities a decline of the clothing sector means economic trouble of a single economic sector in stip it would mean the collapse of the entire city as the experience of so many countries has shown manufacturers and retailers scout the planet for the lowestcost production the search for yet lower costs of production influences the “race to the bottom” concept   map of macedonia with stip’s neighboring towns delchevo berovo sveti nikole underlined       since orders can be placed anywhere on the planet the subcontractors the ones actually who produce the goods are relatively powerless pricetakers rather than partners and dealmakers the world of textile and apparel industry has undergone several production migrations since the s from north america and western europe to japan in the s and early s and then from japan to hong kong taiwan and south korea which dominated global textile and clothing exports in the s and early s finally in the late s and the s there was a third migration to other developing economies including china each new tier of entrants in the global apparel trade had a significantly lower wage rates than its predecessor stip and macedonia have entered this race sometimes ago but an economy whose symbol is the cotton tshirt is not one that can reach eu living standards in the st century  how macedonia arrived at this stage and what options a town like stip and national policy makers have today are crucial questions for the future of the whole country   ii       macedonia’s manchester   stip is a small picturesque little town merely a one hour drive from the capital skopje according to statistics in stip the food is cheapest in macedonia in the country stip is famous for its local pizzalike pastry pastarmajlija most of the town’s houses are modern there are a number of socialist era apartment buildings and newer shopping centers a river passes through the center of stip full of cafés and restaurants this little town is a home to many macedonian historical figures from the chiefs of the ‘infamous’ vmro vancho mihajlov and todor aleksandrov to the partisan leader mihajlo apostolski the key figures of the country’s post  independence former premier nikola kljusev presidents kiro gligorov and the spiritual leader archbishop mihail also hail from there it was in stip during the times of kingdom of yugoslavia in  where the russian musician sergey mihailov staged “pagliacci” the first opera in what is today macedonia and it is in stip’s where “makfest” the most prestigious pop music festival in the country is organized nowadays a vast majority of the  inhabitants of stip are macedonians with a small number of vlachs turkish roma and others although there were more than  turks in the town after  most of them left as part of a population ‘exchange’ organized in the s between socialist yugoslavia and the turkey the vlachs are a small and entrepreneurial minority of     table ethnic breakdown      total macedonians albanians turks roma vlachs stip         although this is an old city there are few buildings left from before the th century before the th century they are no precise statistics on stip’s population figures the only useful information are from traveler’s descriptions of the town according to which stip had  inhabitants in  the number increasing to  in  and then to  in  stip was rather a dynamic and rapidly developing town for this period in history the growth of stip was induced by the trade with thessalonica mainly conducted by the jewish community of the town in this era the stip had  houses out of which  were christian houses whereas  were turkish   the importance of the city as an economic and trade centre of the eastern region of macedonia started to decline when the railway thessalonicaskopjemitrovica was built in  bypassing stip by the end of th century  stip had some  inhabitants of which  macedonians  turks  jews  roma the vlachs appear in the statistics only in  when they amount to  people before the  the city of stip had  neighborhoods out of which  were inhabited by macedonians  were inhabited by turks one by roma and one by jewish inhabitants whereas the rest were mixed there were around  craftsmen’s workshops most of them shoemakers   and clothing producers   and trading houses one hotel  restaurants and  bakeries   before the second world war stip with its  jewish inhabitants had a third biggest jewish community in macedonia after skopje and bitola most of the jews living in stip were engaged in small trade activities and were relatively poor unlike their kin from bitola who were supporting the zionist movement and those from skopje who were well integrated with the rest of the society the jews from stip were mainly working class and had strong procommunist orientation all but few jews from stip were deported to the concentration camp treblinka between  and  march  none of them survived the camp horrors and today there is only one jewish family living in stip   in the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes stip was a town of craftsmen and agricultural producer tobacco cotton poppies and wool after  however stip as other towns in yugoslavia went through a rapid process of mass industrialization and urbanization becoming an important economic center industrialization resulted in most of the surrounding villages becoming depopulated much of the agriculture production has been neglected and people left their villages to work in the industrial capacities in the town in fact the urbanization has been so extreme that out of  villages in the municipality by   have been completely depopulated or have less than  inhabitants the villages that have actually witnessed population growth in the last fifty or so years are either adjacent to the town chardaklija with  and star karaorman with  inhabitants or are on the main road to veles and skopje tri cheshmi with  villagers   table population of stip municipality employment in sectors     municipality town villages employment industry agriculture                                                  the postwar industrialization of stip was based on the production of textiles and clothes  there were other industrial facilities built from scratch some in food production and processing zhito leb an industrial bakery some in metal production metalna producing metal tubes and a very large company producing shoes bargala  however it was the textile factory makedonka founded in  which played the leading role in transforming the town makedonka and its affiliate factory astibo was considered as an important basis for the development of the yugoslav textile and clothing production the importance of this factory was high at that time but until today it continues to condition the current economic situation and potentials for growth of the stip economy   even the physical layout of stip tells a story of a town that is based on the development of makedonka as you enter stip from the west one soon reaches a roundabout near the now defunct trainstation on the left is the region’s main industrial zone since  this area is dominated by stip’s largest socialist enterprise the textile company makedonka  there is a huge white monument of an industrial worker at the entrance symbolizing the economic giant employing  people in the ’s   when one comes in the complex of makedonka on his left he first sees the yellow administrative building where the whole process of production in the factory was planned and administeredmanaged next to the entrance door of this management building there is a plaque announcing the beginning of production of yarn in makedonka in  when the spinning mill was handed over to the workers of the factory further down the main street there are two parallel streets that go through and around the makedonka compound one can see on the left side a huge production facility where the macedonian fabrics were created whereas on the left side there are the storage facilities next to which a railway is passing this is where the trains used to stop at makedonka while the yarn and fabrics were loaded to be transported throughout the former yugoslavia and europe   aerial picture of the colossal buildings of makedonka in the socialist past         since april  the railway line connecting stip to skopje has stop functioning the government deeming it not profitable enough two years earlier makedonka also stopped operating today the compound is falling apart the railway gate locked already rusted the maintenance has been poor in the last ten years and one could see that many windows are broken parts of the walls are deteriorating and the grass in the park is growing wild for some time there is a bulk of old machinery rusted from the rains and the time that past by scattered around the compound an old flag of the factory is still there continually blown by the wind that is so strong in the stip area   to get from the roundabout to the centre a traveler would continue on goce delchev street  one then passes a number of private clothing firms including albatros one of the most dynamic enterprises in town soon one reaches what is today the largest employer in town bargala where more than  employees are making shoes for export to the usa and italy on the left one finally comes to the complex of buildings of astibo the most important clothes producer in socialist times  named after the roman name for stip astibo laid the foundations of the large clothes sector of today  many of the managers of private producers today including those of stipteks and albatros started their careers in the management of astibo  when the company was liquidated and its premises sold a consortium of mainly former managers bought the premises which today again houses eight producers of clothes   the goce delchev road then climbs up a small hill before one reaches the centre of the town  the main cathedral st nikola from the xix century built on the ruins of a xiv century church dominates the centre of the city opposite it is the municipal building housing the mayors office regional offices of the various ministries of the central government the offices of the trade union the citizen’s information centre and the local undp office a few steps from the cathedral are the city museum and a large bronze memorial in the shape of a menorah commemorating the destruction of stip’s jewish community during world war ii    the decline picture of parts of makedonka today         the decline  picture of parts of machines around makedonka today       this is the old commercial centre concentrated around the ottoman covered bazaar bezisten in which traders gathered and sold their items in the past but nowadays is used as an art gallery next to the bezisten is the tall building of stip’s largest hotel oaza built in the socialist era by astibo     to the southwest on the big hill which shadows the town you can see the remains of a medieval castle the isar an old ottoman fortification and halfway up on what is little more than a ledge the small fourteenthcentury church of st arhangel on the same hill there is a newly built cross overlooking the town constructed in celebration of the  years of christianity    the economy in stip revolving around makedonka and astibo declined in the years after the dissolution of yugoslavia and the transformation of the system while during socialist times the many stip inhabitants has a decent life and good working conditions today this is no longer true living standards have worsened drastically at the beginning of ’s workers in the textile sector have far less amenities than  years ago their jobs are not a certainty long gone are the paid holidays at the ohrid lake and the provided social and health care for the whole family no cultural events for the workers are organized by the clothing manufacturing firms any more the salaries are low and the working hours long after  the town did not witness a construction boom typical for the capital or some other parts of the country instead in the city center one finds a new shopping center that is half finished and only a few new apartment buildings   today only  percent of the working age population have official employment in  the employment rate was  percent the employment rate in stip today is higher than the macedonian average of  percent however the eu average is  percent and the lowest rate among eu is poland’s  percent  despite the economic decline industrial production and clothing manufacturing in particular overshadows the economy in stip while in the tertiary sector there are  employees or  of all employed agricultural activity except for occasional subsistence farming has almost diminished today out of  registered employees  persons or  of all employed work in the industrial sector like in the past within the industrial sector clothing manufacturing predominates   table sectors and employment in stip   sector companies employees biggest company clothes   mavis

costs are particularly important in the outward processing trade opt also know as cutmake production the  program “production sharing” or lohnveredelung in this system of international subcontracting firms supply intermediate inputs cut fabric thread buttons and other trim to suppliers typically located in neighboring lowcost countries with reciprocal trade agreements that allow goods assembled offshore to be reimported with a tariff charged only on the value added by foreign labor to make this system worthwhile the cost savings associated with lowwage assembly must exceed the inherent additional costs of production fragmentation namely twoway shipments longer and larger inventory and added co—ordination to manage the fragmented supply chain even small deviations in production costs can in turn drive the producer “out of the market” the buyer turning to the competitors   stip clothing producers today fear that they will be driven out of the market the history of the development of the industry in this town tells us why stip has a long tradition of clothing and textile production first developed after the second world war concentrated around makedonka playing the key role and then astibo founded in  makedonka began production with  workers in april of  with new machines bought from the united kingdom makedonka was one of the biggest and most modern factories in the whole sfr yugoslavia producing yarn fabrics and cloth for the domestic clothing market it included a restaurant serving one free meal for the employees per day three discount stores and a library makedonka had apartment buildings constructed for its workers who could buy these through different kinds of credits the company expanded both in size and in production capacity building a weaving plant in  a spinning mill in  clothing manufacturing line in  and a jeans factory in  the number of workers grew year by year from  in  to the peak of  in     makedonka’s fibers and cloth was used by the clothing producing unit astibo was founded in  with  employees this company also grew quickly the core business was the design production and distribution of men’s women’s and children’s clothes already in  astibo had about  employed persons it even founded production units in a number of towns in the eastern part of macedonia employing the spouses of the men working in the mine pits in eastern macedonia a decade after it was established the conglomerate became the biggest producer of light casual clothes in all yugoslavia and one of the top five producers of apparel overall with  own shops throughout the country in  astibo began exporting its production making contracts with foreign buyers “manufacturing preordered items already paid by the partners abroad” by  astibo exported half of its production   the crisis of stip’s textile industry began in the ’s makedonka had a number of problems difficulties procuring cotton from the ’s onward when domestic production drastically decreased overemployment in the factory and new openings of units to absorb unemployed persons increasing indebting from getting loans to pay the wages of the workers bad management and political mingling added to the negative effects of the wars and the disintegration of yugoslavia   around the same times similar problems faced the stip clothing industry in the early ’s astibo had problems with regular payments for its sales on the domestic market and decided to step up exports working on the basis of the “lohnveredelung” production this job was easy to do as the foreign partners mainly german ones provided all the necessary materials and astibo had to do only stitching and sewing the firm now did not need to develop own products and sell them to foreign partners neither it had to purchase the materials for manufacturing   meanwhile for various reasons that had little touch with economic realities the number of workers of astibo grew to a record  in   since astibo was part of a system of command economy the management was not much concerned about long terms effects of employing huge amounts of workers during the massive employing of youth in the ’s for example the management boasted that “we will hire new employees because we have plenty of orders…what will happen when there will be no more orders we will think about this when such times come”   besides overemployment the wars of yugoslav succession which disrupted the quickest delivery to western buyers of apparel were factors that lead to astibo’s collapse in the ’s the ratio between workers and administration was striking at the end of the ’s out of the  workers up to  were employed in the nonmanufacturing section of the company the firm also could not realize its financial claims from companies throughout the former yugoslavia     table workers in makedonka and astibo     makedonka astibo         mid ’s               late ’s   dec      both companies went bankrupt in the mid ’s but their transformation then led to different outcomes  throughout the ’s the government tried to save astibo and makedonka through various ‘programs for restructuring’ laying off surplus workers and subsidizing production through loans astibo was liquidated only in the summer of  following one unsuccessful tender a consortium of nine clothing manufacturers bought astibo to use the premises for production purposes for  euros each member of the consortium paid a share according to the size of the objects bought the sum ranging from  to  euros    companies that have bought off from the formerly socialist enterprise of astibo   lars linea ve elena modena mont vabo eskada vit   on the other hand after much wrangling makedonka was broken up into eight separate legal entities liquidated at the end of  and sold separately unit by unit during the liquidation of makedonka much of the equipment was disbanded and stolen some of the machines sold as scrap metal smashed by bulldozers throughout the privatization process eight of the newer machines were relocated to the textile factory “alkaloid” from berovo  there is no document testifying if the machines were sold or rented out in the makedonka compound the only machines that survived the transition and are still used for production are those from “ad ros” while in the late s makedonka was still one of the largest textile companies in south east europe today most of makedonka has been rented out only a small part used for textile and clothing production only few firms use the premises employing far less workers than in the glorious past   the

makedonka have been replaced by newcomers in the clothing manufacturing  while in the socialist past of stip there were two large companies now there a dozen of clothing producers managers engineers and economists from the socialist times have started up own businesses using the skills and the contacts of the two defunct most of the newcomers like stipteks manufacture clothes textile production is almost disappearing like astibo in the ’s nowadays stip companies are very much focused upon “outward processing production having few value added products and currently doing only ‘sewing and stitching’ this activity is lowvalue added laborintensive and is using unskilled labor for a mass production of lowerquality andor standard products most of the companies are small and midsize and the workers are skilled in simple cut and make techniques needed for the production of casual or “light clothes” such as shirts blouses tshirts etc they employ mainly female workers –semiskilled and unskilled – and outsourcing to household production is quite common in the low end of the market this is a sector where relatively modern technology can be adopted very quickly due to the relatively low investment costs and companies sprung up and close often profits are small and life is hard for these companies for example for a small size producer employing about  workers the yearly turnover is about  euros and the monthly profit about  euros   the producers of more complicated clothing items are better off but are few only a smaller number of stip clothes producers such as beass or stipko manufacture only or predominantly jackets coats and other more sophisticated semiheavy and “heavy apparel tailored” this production is less exposed to market vulnerability due to higher transport costs needs more skilled labor and more capital investment the process of sewing such clothes is longer than the production of casual clothes it takes about  minutes to sew a simply designed pair of pants compared to the  minutes needed for the production of shirts on the other hand it takes  minutes to manufacture a more complicated item such as a working suite or a vest the more sophisticated products are more expensive the basic product a shirt costing  euro to make the pants  euros but the working suite  euros naturally then the profits for manufacturers that make heavy clothing are higher   however the systemic feature of clothing production system especially nowadays is the domination of buyerdriven value chains large retailers marketers and branded manufacturers like jc penney liz claiborne gap levis’ wrangler and tommy hilfiger generally design andor market—but do not make—the branded products they order they are “manufacturers without factories” with the physical production of goods separated from the design and marketing in searching out producers for their items manufacturers and retailers scout the planet for the lowestcost production the subcontractors have to follow orders and accept prices by retailers   that is the case with  of the stip base clothing companies for example stipteks the oldest private clothing producers in macedonia having been set up in  has a production hall and the offices located in a grey building in the industrial zone next to two other clothes manufacturers stipteks has german partners who come to macedonia periodically to order different kinds of clothes from local producers and stipteks  once the latest fashion trends are clear the germans send design of the products that stipteks needs to manufacture the german partner also sends the fabric or cloth to be made into tshirts when the order is made the deadlines for production are short and the work is intense it is often required to work over time the t shirts are produced in a large hall on the bottom floor where  women are seated in five long rows  in front of them are sewing machines the women forming fordlike factory lines in which everyone is focused on one specific task   the cloth that enters the company is first cut by a tailor if not automated usually this physically demanding job is done by men stipteks being no exception the manager is aware of the need of modernizing production and minimizing costs through increased reliance on automatic machines therefore he plans to purchase a machine for computer aided manufacturing that will replace the tailor each line has about fifty women working on a piece of cloth ie the separate components of a woman’s tshirt at the end of the hall there are pressing machines ironing the shirts just made   while the ground floor is huge but noisy the administration part of the company on the first floor is small and modern the office of the manager dominates the space together with the offices of the accountants the secretary and of the sales representative here are a computer with internet connection fax machine a copier and a telephone on this floor the contacts are made deals are considered and accepted the manager is busy his mobile phone ringing constantly during the working hours like many managers in stip dushko zendelov is a former astibo director obtaining such orders is a key to the company’s survival competition is fierce and not only from macedonian companies stipteks managers are aware of the fact that labor costs are particularly important in the outward processing trade the stip low labor costs  eurohour which is similar to the labor costs in bulgaria and romania are incomparable with the even lower ones in serbia ukraine moldova or in the east  bangladesh cambodia and china therefore the managers of stipteks have invested part of their profits setting up a production unit in radovish where the wages are lower then in stip   the next door company briteks tells us a similar story the company is run by risto brashnarov and his sister biljana cvetkova brasnarova their father was the general manager of makedonka founded in  the firm’ basic activity is the manufacture of ladies winter and summer readytowear lines for the domestic and foreign markets briteks has  square meters space the hall painted in stark violet and white the manager’s office is at the entrance of the premise equipped with relatively new furniture a notebook on the manager’s desk although still enrolled in a program for clothing engineers risto in his ies haven’t yet finished university finding it not quite useful biljana is a graduated economist with interest in clothing design opposite his office is the hall with the workers there is also a storage depot and the tailor’s room   briteks produces some  clothing items annually in  lines however the manager admitted that the “company lacks space” and that “the hall is overcrowded as it should accommodate only three lines” finding extra space is hard and costly the factory started its work with merely  employed people  today there are about  employees  percent of employees are women most of them around  years old  in  another production unit was opened in skopje and managed by risto’s sister however the attempt was unsuccessful and now the family concentrates their business only in stip about  percent of production is based on orders made from foreign companies based in the netherlands belgium germany and greece and arranged through an intermediary firm global unlike stipteks which is sent the cloth to sew by the buyer briteks uses the services of global to procure the necessary fabrics from italy china and indonesia brasnarov then transports the final products through birkart international logistics company   besides working for foreign clients briteks also produces own clothes about  percent of its total output the manager biljana designs the fashion lines of the company  she has visited international fashion fairs yet risto brashnarov feels that they “need help to create own brandproduction especially in the sphere of design and marketing” the latest global developments in the fashion industry affect their work the company receives smaller orders from clients that need to be quickly finished faced with the difficulties brashnarov family decided to invest in  square meters of real estate to rent the rent is to cover losses from the clothing company if they occur   iv textile families     in the fall of  macedonia held its first free and democratic elections  in  it declared independence in the same year the wars in the former yugoslavia started in croatia to spread to bosniaherzegovina in spring   the end of communism the breakup of yugoslavia and the imposition of an international sanctions on serbia   reinforced in  by a unilateral embargo on macedonia imposed by greece – hit the macedonian clothes and textile sector severely    in  the macedonian government set up a council to prepare the privatization of astibo which at that time still had about  employees  an attempt by the former management to buy out the company came to nothing  at the same time makedonka was also struggling  in  it was included among the  biggest loss making companies in the country  following strikes and protests the liquidation of the company was postponed  only in  bankruptcy procedures were initiated in december  the company was liquidated  one year later astibo was also liquidated   today makedonka and astibo are history their premises used either by private clothes producers or by other businesses  but the textile families of stip remain the largest part of the towns’ workforce if one looks at what has happened to stip’s proud textile families from the socialist era one comes upon two striking discoveries  one concerns the changing role of women who have in many cases become the only breadwinners in their households  the other is the growing dependency of younger family members on their parents and even grandparents and in particular on those who already receive a public pension   the clothing companies are the biggest employer in stip most of the employees in this sector are women women and those younger than  or  in particular are almost exclusively employed in the clothing producing sector half of the women that are less than  produce clothes an estimated number of  women work in the stip’s  clothing companies whereas another  women work in other sectors today manufacturers looking for women to work in clothing production have difficulty finding suitable candidates young trained and skilful sewers of the macedonian clothes for europe this increases the salaries for the stip workers the average one being between  euros the producers claim that the wages in this sector are too high in stip and highest in macedonia one response by producers from stip has been to move part of their production to smaller towns and villages stipteks has moved production in radovish mavis is opening a factory in sveti nikole and probistip lars in zrnovci and linea in probistip the salary of one worker in radovis is around  percent less than her colleague in stip   table different facts about stip   registered employed  december   registered unemployed september   registered unemployed men  registered unemployed women  registered pensioners   social welfare recipients  september  students in secondary schools   children  age   stip       today  percent of the working age population has official employment in  the rate was  percent  however the employment rate of the persons between  and  years old is  percent from those older than  a small fraction  are employed and  registered as looking for a job the rest are pensioners in total there are  pensioners in stip most of the pensioners have retired under the  law on pensions which stipulated the retirement age being  for women and  for men alternatively one could have retired with at least  years of working experience for women and  years of experience for men therefore the number of pensioners is high and employment rate among the age group  is minute since many of the young are unemployed the pensions of their grandmothers and grandfathers help the extended families survive the new economic realities since independence in macedonia as a result of the aging of the population rise in life expectancy and the mentioned retirement eligibility criteria the number of pensioners grew significantly those that were employed during the industrialization drive in the ’s retired in the ’s the data from the pension and disability fund show that merely in ten years  the number of pensioners went up for  as the unemployment also grew the number of contributors to the pension scheme fell and the ratio between contributors and pensioners according to the official statistics went from  in  to  in  this portrays a very serious situation where one and a half employed person pays from hisher salary the pension of one pensioner the international standard for sustainable pension scheme is to have at least three people that pay the pension of a pensioner but every system strives for even bigger ratio ie in sweden the ratio between contributors and pensioners goes up to  therefore reform of the pension system was needed to introduce stricter criteria for retiring according to the new scheme to be introduced in two years time eligible for a retirement benefit are contributors with  years of age for men ie  years of age for women and minimum  years of service the question that remains unanswered is whether the women presently working in the clothing companies can work until they are   nowadays the companies in stip do not want to employ older women than  as the today’s old who have secured pensions die out there will be huge consequences for the stip families stip’s women employed in the clothing sector are not likely to physically endure the demanding job beyond  and will face lay offs on the other hand there are not many other jobs produced by the local economy and their husbands or sons are likely to be unemployed or forced to work in the grey sector of the economy jobs in the public administration that are more secure are coveted and will be even more so in the future but macedonia is also under pressure by the international financial institutions to decrease the size of the public administration the future for towns like stip then seam bleak     the present is not idle either andon mahojsev stip representative of the alliance of trade unions of macedonia the country’s largest and oldest trade union points to a little book of some  pages with a black cover on his desk  it has the title black book – stories from stip and karbinci and is a collection of  statements of those who lost out in the macedonian transition there are many disturbing evidence of social decay and poverty families have lost hope in the system and the state young and old reveal that jobs are difficult to find and that those that are available are poorly paid working from dawn to dust for meager pay not being able to raise children properly is a stark contrast to the conditions and life styles of workers in socialist times   let us explore some of the typical stories in  kiril dimitrov and his wife were both employed as tailors in cloth producer astibo earning the equivalent of  € a month together  their son and daughter were then  and  years old  milancho manev was a worker in textile producer makedonka when it still had over  employees  stojan stojanov a former football player was also employed by makedonka as was his wife  zoran andonovski the son of a manager in a socialist trading company was in his last year at the stip commercial middle school  riste basharov was figherfighter in astibo and his wife with a degree in economics was working in makedonka     today in  kiril dimitrov and his wife are still working as tailors in the private sector together earning about half as much as they did  years ago  €  their son has completed the secondary textile school and has been unemployed for eight years  he is dreaming of leaving the country  the daughter is an economist married in skopje  milancho manev lost his job and income and is today unable to pay his water bills  a newspaper reported that last summer there were another  people who like him worked for public utility companies instead of paying their bills  stojan stojanov has also lost his job and lives today of the salary of his wife who now works for a private clothes producer              not all textile families have fared badly  zoran andonovski is today a manager of a company employing  people and producing women’s blouses  however the annual profits of his company are below  euros the lifestyle this allows resembles that of a qualified worker in the s more than that of a successful entrepreneur  riste basharov has done best of all taking over a private pastry shop from his parents and expanding successfully  he has however left the world of clothes and textiles behind   v      moving up    how can textile companies move up the value added chain  what is most profitable today  in clothing manufacturing biggest profits are made from combinations of skillintensive activities such highvalue research design sample making sales marketing and financial services  improvements in quality control packing warehousing and transport also earn large profits within the clothing industry as profitability is greatest in these parts of the global value chain it is natural that there are high entry barriers for new firms in fact leading clothing retailers and manufacturers spend lavish advertising budgets and promotional campaigns to create and sustain global brands they use sophisticated and costly information technology to lower costs and to have a “quick response” to fashion whims of the public in the world trade of apparel leading retailers designers and marketers link overseas factories with product niches in their main consumer markets suppliers often need to undertake frequent shipments to replenish stocks in retailer’s stores working under tight schedules it is extremely difficult for local suppliers to acquire the skills and move from contract manufacturing to a fullpackage supply and then to develop new production and marketing niches   upgrading within production requires countries and suppliers to cocontract with buyers to provide both the raw materials ie textile cloth and finished garments achieving a ‘fullpackage’ of services  from textile production to cutting sewing and packaging full package production thus means that an eu retailer can go to a macedonian manufacturer and say ‘we want so many thousand jackets we will send the designs to you down the line’ the macedonian firm then gets the raw material designs the jackets according to the eu retailer’s master plan makes them packs them and sends them directly back to the eu   thus there will be a new premium on skilled labor as companies have to extend their range of skills from just sewing and stitching compared with the mere assembly of imported inputs fullpackage production fundamentally changes the relationship between buyer and supplier in a direction that gives far greater autonomy and learning potential for industrial upgrading to the supplying firm    however a move to a full package of services is very difficult to achieve it does not only require improvement of production and design efficiency but also financing and expertise in marketing material sourcing quality control logistics storage and retail distribution for example efficiency in the marketing of products increasingly becomes extremely important factor of comparative advantage waiting for customers to come is no longer sufficient to increase exports marketing strategies have to be developed and applied another factor in the consideration of comparative advantage is the design and quality of products permanent upgrading is essential for achieving maintaining and improving competitiveness at the moment the vast majority of stip and macedonian companies are engaged in the assembly phase of the production of clothes through outward processing agreementsprograms this is a low value added activity which is very vulnerable to market fluctuations    delivering a full package of services is however still a far step from producing own brands and etiquettes improving through a functional upgrading means moving into higher valuedadded stages such as design branding marketing and retailing and is more difficult to achieve only when local firms are capable of making retailer’s or branded buyer’s designs into finished products on time with volume and quality that fulfill their standards they develop a potential to cut their buyers and establish own brand names this strategic move requires servicesrelated expertise in designing marketing retailing financing and the gathering of market intelligence on foreign markets the strategy has been tested in turkey hong kong and china where some leading manufacturers like mavi jeans have launched their own brand names and are entering retail distribution within this segment of the clothing industry the biggest profits are being made but upgrading is quite costly   the owner of eam kole patrakliski a former worker of astibo has succeeded in the business of knitting and sewing eam has not only succeeded in achieving a full package of service status but today is also a producer of own brand apparel items from a point of view of higher valued added manufacturing this firm is the most successful stip producer eam produces  of the clothing items under its own brand the company was founded in  with  employees while today there are  another forty are employed on a parttime basis their basic activity is the production of tricot fabrics and tricot garments eam aims at vertically integrating production reducing costs for purchasing textiles from abroad since january  they are trying to grow cotton on a small field near stip and have also experimented producing textiles for their own products eam exports to germany switzerland slovakia croatia bosnia and kosovo last year he made profits of about  million denars or  euros   very few clothing producers from stip are moving up and upgrading production besides kole’s eam which has own products marketed and sold abroad few companies make own designed clothes gracija with about  own production mond  beass  briteks  milanomodena  zenvivendi  and sthipko  moreover only a small number of stip producers  such as anateks kitgo starteks beass starteks stipko dona stilteks ziziteks makteks and galija manufacture only or predominantly jackets coats and other more sophisticated semiheavy and “heavy apparel tailored”   upgrading is difficult task if you cannot find partners to sell your products stip companies have low managerial and marketing skills many of the managers of the new private companies come from the old textile companies there are numerous others besides kole from eam  for example eight out of nine companies that bought the premises of astibo are run by former astibo and makedonka managers lars linea ve modena mont vabo eskada and vit the last general manager of astibo before the transformation panche nasev also leads a clothing company zen the father of beti saneva now the owner of beas one of the stip’s leading clothing companies was one of the founders of astibo when it comes to exporting own products stip managers do business with old contacts from former yugoslavia to find partners in western europe is a more demanding task   thus firms like beas which sews for liz claiborne and is the largest semiheavy producer with  employees producing coats trousers and jackets all year round exports own clothes to bosnia croatia kosovo and albania only in addition it produces goods on the domestic market sold through  shops across macedonia of those  being in skopje in order to break out of ‘lohn’ beas is actively searching for new business partners regularly visiting international trade fashion fairs including florence milano düsseldorf paris the company also plans to modernize buying computer cutting system and a machine for computerized ironing currently looking for second hand machines in the netherlands belgium until recently beas worked through an intermediary but in the summer they contracted their partner directly   another good example is milano which first started out with  employees and produced only for own brand modena the manager rented a  sq meter shop in the center of stip hired young people and trained them and bought old sewing machines from greece from the beginning besides contract manufacturing they exported to all former yugoslav markets destinations which were familiar to the manager and where he had business contacts during the time of astibo in  milano moved to the large production facilities located on astibo grounds the move triggered milano real expansion with  employees and  production lines producing  percent of the clothes under its own brand and planning to stop ‘lohnarbeit’ contract manufacturing in the future all marketing is currently done by the manager and his daughter   like in the past the intermediaries are very involved in marketing since they have good contacts in the west the sale intermediaries or agents had a very important role in the textile and clothing industry in the sfr yugoslav period at that time in macedonia there were two intermediary companies inteks and makoteks dealing with export of finished products and import of raw materials and fabrics inteks was a trade representative of a large conglomerate of  factoriesproducers from macedonia makedonka and astibo were members of inteks in fact the government of socialist macedonia urged the smaller apparel producers to join inteks in the  “inteks” had  percent of the total turnover and  percent of the profits of the textile and apparel producers in the socialist republic of macedonia and made exports worth  million usd in the western markets and  in the socialist block today the company has lost its intermediary position and the owner zoran azmanov lives of renting the real estate of the company   former managers of inteks have however continued with the old job the two directors and partners of texico a leading sales intermediary mr gruevski and mr vaskov are an example texico exists since november  and employs six persons working with  foreign partners mainly from germany but also from italy and belgium texico is intermediary in the annual sale of one million pieces of apparel their way of business is to negotiate deals with the foreign buyers together with the local producers texico’s profit margin is five percent the annual turnover of texico is around two million euros   while lavishbelt int polaris and etra have about the same annual turnover as texico the biggest company in this business nowadays is global employing about  people and with an annual turnover of about eur  million global’s  percent of its customers are from the eu particularly from germany netherlands italy and england and  percent are from the usa global cooperates with the well established german clothing company steilmann group the owner mrvladimir ichokaev has built a logistical centre in skopje with a own clothing facility a customs depot and computeraided manufacturing cam with computeraided design cad systems and plans to invest in a laboratory for washing clothes some  other companies throughout macedonia manufacture for mrichokaev   international aid programs like the swiss import promotion program sippo aim at helping macedonian clothing companies improve marketing skills and find contacts in the west sippo a service of the swiss state born out of the idea to support countries that have a large trade deficit with switzerland providing information for the macedonian companies through gathering general publications on the sector through contact to contact and market overviews in preparation for textiles sippo also organizes meetings between swiss clients and macedonian producers and various trainings and seminars moreover sippo organizes visits to different fairs for producers of home textile the clothing manufacturers have not been helped in such a way since most of them do contract manufacturing and there is “little sense in representing at such events” instead sippo has prepared a booklet of some of the bigger macedonian lohnveredelung producers having at least  employees through the booklet sippo helps apparel producers directly find partners this activity however in a way disturbs the work of the intermediaries as it empowers the apparel manufacturers to make direct deals with buyers   in addition the dutch government agency cbi has recently started an “export development program” edp to help the macedonian textile sector to diminish the share of lohnveredelung in the production of macedonian garments and invest into own collections andor move towards fullpackage services the edp envisaged to last for  years is planned to be launched in the beginning of  with a total budget of slightly more than  million euros cbi plans to help through introducing macedonian exporters to importers from the eu providing online access to updated market information and businesstobusiness services enabling access to cbi’s “trade intermediary service” organizing trainings in netherlands as well as visits to fashion fairs in eu    the usaid supports the textile sector through two projects the macedonian competitiveness activity’s textile cluster and the ebiz project which established a technological transfer centre in stip and created the macedonian fashion portal in june  mca facilitated the establishment of the macedonian national entrepreneurship and competitiveness council necc which on competitive basis selected the areas where clusters will be promoted the council has two members from the clothing industry gjorgji miladinov the owner of kimiko and vladimir ichokaev from global following the establishment of the lamb meet and cheese cluster the tourism cluster the wine cluster and the it cluster in the summer of  the council decided to found a textiles cluster jasmina miteva owner of magnolia was originally a member of the council too she together with mr ichokaev made the presentation in favor of selecting clothing production as a new cluster the fact that the textile cluster was founded only year and a half before the project is to be closed questions the criteria on which the clusters were selected especially because textiles alone is as important for macedonia as all the other economic activities together the textile cluster was established with the main objective to improve the competitiveness of the companies in this sector through introducing improved work methods in production sales marketing and so on and attracting adequate buyers for its products   the mca’s textile cluster helps macedonian companies take part and market their products at industry fairs most recently at the fair in copenhagen in february and the milan fashion fair held in early march  in september they helped another  companies to display at another fair in milano including the astibo export consortium milano vit and linea mca’s textile cluster synchronizes its activities with the trade textile association tta founded in late october  by a number of clothing producers supported by the mighty intermediaries and policy makers such as the representative of the ministry of economy the tta quickly filled the space occupied during the socialist times by the increasingly passive textile and garment association of the economic chamber a number of apparel companies from stip participate in the activities of the tta and the textile cluster moreover the council of leadership of the textile cluster consists of  members out of which  stem from stip while the leading person of global vladimir ichokaev is in charge of the marketing and promotional activities of the cluster unfortunately the cluster’s activities are set to end in  a question remains what would happen with the institutions formed by the cluster the tta planning to join efforts and merge with the economic chamber association    another tool for improving marketing is the web portal “fashion mk” launched in april  this  fashion portal is a “businesstobusiness bb online marketplace” a jointventure between ebiz and macedonian partner einsof currently the portal has  registered members  from stip and is trying to interconnect international buyers and suppliers with macedonian manufacturers as a “virtual intermediary” fashion mk has an ongoing communication with the textile cluster the trade textile association and the economic chamber it helped organize presentations of macedonian companies at fashion fairs in milan and madrid and endorses russia and ukraine should be target market for macedonian companies “fashion mk” facilitates collaboration with economic chambers from russia italy and france   although the portal is operational it is not yet fully updated with information the investments page having almost no data for example still since its opening the portal has attracted quite an attention with the number portal visitors increasing from  in july  to  in october  until early november  there were  advertisements altogether the service being free for foreigners but costing  euros for the macedonian companies the portal’s software however is limited it is not designed to promote macedonian designed clothes but the facilities of the companies that produce lohnveredelung it currently offers a virtual showroom and virtual fashion catalogue and there are also links to the companies’ web sites for  euros a domestic company can attach  photos from its fashion line on the portal although it surfaced as an idea making new specialized software enabling comprehensive online presentation of macedonian garment manufacturers is not in the business plan of the portal although the ebiz project was initially supposed to end on st december  the portal is to continue receiving support until september  according to the business plan approved by ebiz and einsoft the fashion mk should became selfsustainable within three years   in order to move up besides marketing skills stip textile companies need access to raw materials and accessories unlike lohn production where the materials are shipped by the buyer when making own clothes macedonian manufacturers need to source all the necessary materials given that macedonian production of cloth and fibers has since the transformation plummeted clothing producers need to procure materials for own manufacturing from abroad this is a task in itself take beas for an example in the past they had a bad experience with a delivery from turkey that had low quality and faulty materials today they cooperate with an intermediary firm from belgrade for importing raw materials bought from japan korea italy and holland   on the other had a recent fashion line produced through by astibo export group a joint effort of three stip companies milano vit and linea was made with italian materials making it costly and difficult to sell availability of cheap raw materials form other countries is strongly conditioned by the state regulated custom duties for import on the other hand eu policies of regional diagonal cumulation also affect stip export oriented producers as they are not able to source cheap raw materials from countries like turkey or bulgaria process them and sell the final products to the eu under made in macedonia labels    clothing manufacturers that aim at moving up also need to have good designers to produce new innovative trendy items although milano for example has  inhouse designers there are few macedonians educated in clothing design there is the macedonian fashion formation established in the spring  although the founders informally gathered and discussed contemporary issues relevant to the clothing industry already a year before the formation currently has  members recently their membership grew while in the country there are around  designers mostly from academia italiana an italian school for design the formation is also represented in the mca’s cluster trying to engage the clothing producers yet most of the managers are resistant and sceptical to take on fashion designers those represented in the textile cluster proposing that the fashion designers and the textile companies should equally share the costs of investment in the creation of a macedonian brand this is mission impossible for the designers as they are usually not wealthy and lack finances for such an investment there is an uneasy relationship between the two groups the fashion line produced by astibo export group was made by a slovenian designer the companies believing that the slovenian designer will help their collection be promoted on european markets   clothing manufacturers that aim at moving up also need to digitize production and buy sophisticated machinery and computers integrating computeraided manufacturing cam with computeraided design cad systems produces quicker and more efficient manufacturing processes this methodology is applied in different manufacturing areas tailors like mihajlo and his wife from the previous section are no more needed in modern clothing producing companies cutting the patterns of blouses or shirts is no more done by human hand machines do it the advantage of the cad system is that the apparel producers that use it make maximum use of the cloth and minimize the work done manually moreover the cam cutting is about  to  cheaper and faster than handmade cutting but these computerized robots are quite expensive to buy and only few companies in macedonia have bought them cad and cam machines cost up to  euros and are found only in the skopje based clothing producer orka and global and the stip based logistics company birkart they are much needed and beas for example is in the moment looking for second hand machines in the netherlands belgium stipteks has also recently ordered a cam machine from its partner in germany mavis albatros and milano have also recently invested buying cad systems   easy access to finances and cheap loans is of vital importance for the apparel producers in stip and macedonia in general because the moving up needs serious capital investment besides buying updated machinery the company planning to move up has to plan for other costs if a firm is to procure fabrics and other basic materials on its own instead of relying on the foreign partners it needs to invest a substantial amount of money for example for  shirts to be made the firm will need to buy  meters of fabrics plus basic materials such as threads or buttons the costs of this procurement might be up to eur  additionally one should bear in mind that it will take some time to produce and transport the shirts and a period of time before the western partner pays the order during this period the firm has to pay the workers the custom clearance house the transport company etc two to three months may pass before the macedonian producer paid for the job done meantime investing substantial own financial resources   a big problem for moving up of clothing producers therefore is the availability of cheap capital the macedonian financial system is far from being developed as it lacks many financial instruments and institutions existing in western countries while those which are active are either still undeveloped that is a serious drawback particularly taking into consideration the low level of domestic capital accumulation and the low level of fdi in the country while it takes a lot of capital to invest in a new collection bank credits are very expensive high interest rates at least  of the commercial banks through which most credit lines are administered and the high collaterals they require limit the access to finance of the companies and determine the low level or no investments in the clothingproducing sector which are essential for upgrade of the production chain and production of “made in macedonia” clothes   in fact the vast majority of the interviewed managers of the clothing producing companies in stip did identify access to loans and other financial means as one of the biggest problems in their work and plans for the future high interest rates of credits and bank loans high collateral demanded underdeveloped equipment leasing etc apparel companies from stip most frequently use the shortterm loans with relatively unfavorable interest rates while averting the longerterm loans because obtaining them requires the high collateral  the banking policy is created on a central level although from very recently branches have started to grant loans based on their own decision particularly when the loan amount is not huge compared to those in the neighboring countries such as bulgaria or serbia and montenegro the offered loans in macedonia with key interest rate amounting to  are expensive and unattractive to overcome such difficulties and to bridge capital needs a number of stip based companies have initiated the idea of jointly opening a bank to serve the interests of the clothing producers even      capital is a less of a problem for companies such as birkart and canda dominating one segment of the clothing industry logistics and transport interestingly these two are the only stip companies that had foreign capital invested in birkart is the only international logisticstransport company with a branch office in macedonia it is a classical foreign investment by a german company and to this day it is fully owned by german birkart the birkart offices are completely modern high tech computers generally young staff and everyone seemed very busy all computers are directly connected to the birkart global software allowing them to trace any delivery of any product around the world if a fabric is produced in china shipped to hamburg transported by a german company to macedonia for ‘lohn’ tailored in stip and returned to germany birkart’s software can trace the product from china to stip and into the final retail outlet in germany birkart dominates the logistics in the macedonian clothing sector it works with  apparel companies in total  suppliers from stip and  retailers based in west europe the company also owns a customs depot carinski sklad with around  sq meters to handle up to  pieces where it does custom clearance for the apparel producers  they provide services like labeling of clothes packaging sorting and they prepare all paper work for the final transport and export to european markets   a close company to birkart is new trend center for textile technology founded in the beginning of the year as a joint venture between zmaj promet and ebiz new trend provides cad and cam services to interested macedonian apparel producers they began with promotion of the cam in may  and the stip apparel producers are increasingly becoming to use the service the cad system is being used in two shifts whiles the cam in one shift new trend has currently  customers  of them from stip the number of new trend’s customers is increasing every month the machines are both located on the ground floor of the main building companies in germany only have to send the design per email and the raw materials and “new trend” then prepares the clothing pieces for the companies using sophisticated software new trend provides quality control of the materials and supplies clothing companies like milano for example with the accessory materials intended for cad and cam services importing them from italy they closely cooperate with the intermediary company “global” from skopje for new trend and birkart it would be great if there are more companies moving to fullpackaging using their global networks   vi politics and the macedonian tshirt     the macedonian clothing industry is struggling to survive the fast changing world trends the situation is alarming because most of the production is low value added yes the absolute figures for the export of clothing items have risen however the rise in the exports has not been equal for all clothing items in the last ten years the production of simple clothing materials to make such as women’s suits blouses and shirts have risen while more complicated to manufacture items such as suits for men or women have experienced a dramatic decline in production figures the decline is particularly striking in the manufacturing of men’s suits   exports of textile products and clothes in the period    year exports of textile products in usd exports of clothes in usd men’s suits thousands of pieces women’s suits thousands of pieces                                                                                production of “light clothingapparel” is simple and low value added it is mostly dependent on the availability of cheap labor stip is running out of such labor and there are signs for trouble already showing the plea of the manager of the first private clothing making company stipteks mr dushko zendelski  is particularly alarming   “if the state institutions continue with this kind of public policy the managers will transfer their capital in other areas for example i have bought a milk company if the things get even worse then they are now i will transfer my capital in that area the situation in the textile sector has a downfall tendency from the war in  until today the prices for the products have fallen in the period of the war and until now they are the same but from the other hand all the expenses have increased this is one of the mayor problems the grip over the neck is strengthening every day i really do not now how much longer we can last”   public policies attempt to aid the manufacturers from stip and elsewhere but are they succeeding there are three main policies that affect entrepreneurs and employees in the sector trade and customs policy social policy and education policy let us look at each of these three in turn the most important steps in the area of trade and customs were taken in recent years through joining the world trade organization and signing stabilization and association agreement with the european union  acceding to the wto meant possibilities for trade increased having an agreement with the eu also gives more opportunities for export but exporting to the eu is not easy for macedonian clothing manufacturers because on top of the costs of their production they need to pay on average twelve percent of custom fees in accordance with the eu system of cummulation of rules of origin   in fact for macedonian clothes to become more competitive on foreign markets two important issues remain to be resolved the issue of macedonian customs fees on imports of raw materials for the clothing producing industry and the issue of diagonal cummulation of origin for exports to the eu  in early july  the government introduced a temporary measure allowing import of raw materials for clothing manufacturing customs free of macedonia’s custom duties the impact of this measure in the first two months of its application has been that “around a million euro worth of goods has been imported under this provision” this positive measure for the macedonian clothing industry is now enforced under the new customs law implemented from january     on th june  the minister of economy announced that “from january  macedonia will become member of the european system of diagonal cummulation which will allow the macedonian clothing products to be exported in the eu without custom fees this will have a positive impact on the overall economy and will improve the business climate of the country and attract foreign investments”   however the situation with diagonal cumulation is far from resolved  macedonian did not become a member of the european system of diagonal cummulation a significant part of the responsibility for this situation lies with eu the commission agrees “regarding diagonal cummulation the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fulfilled the conditions for accession to the system which was particularly necessary for the encouragement of foreign investment and the increase of export” moreover “there was a delay in the implementation of this item of the thessalonica agenda but the responsibility for the slow progress was entirely on the european commission”  but on a informal briefing held on june nd  the ec offered to macedonia and croatia subregional bilateral cummulation between the two countries and the eu and not membership in the pan european association of diagonal cummulation requested by the western balkan countries several times and promised by the eu at the  council summit in thessalonica in the same time eu is to extend the aforemention association to the mediterranean countries algeria israel morocco tunisia and etc   why has there been no more lobbying to change this macedonian government has asked the eu to allow macedonia into the system of diagonal cumulation and has built administrative capacities for this to happen however the lobbying from the side of the producers and the traders with clothing has been insufficient in the case of the mediterranean countries strong support for their application was given from the retail chains in europe that sell the clothes produced in these countries macedonian producers did not lobby the european retail chains neither did the macedonian traders with clothing what is more they are not organized separately in two different associations and thus can not easily partner up with european lobby groups such as the “eurocommerce” association of european traders and the “eurotex” association of european clothing producers position papers of which they could use to influence eu policy on rules of origin towards macedonia macedonian clothing producers should stop looking up to the government to solve this problem of theirs and look up european partners to aid them   who is affected by the customs and cummulation issue to understand this let us look at the companies we presented from stip those companies that produce their own products for domestic market but are highly interested to export them to the eu such as modena vit linea beas stipko gracija eam and briteks are most affected they are sourcing raw materials to make macedonian clothes from countries like bulgaria romania and turkey under the new customs regulations they do not pay customs for import of cloth and other raw materials however in order to export the clothes made of these materials in europe the stip companies have to pay on average  customs once the goods arrive in the eu if macedonia is a member of the eu system of diagonal cummulation the clothes of the stip producers would cumulate origin and would be possible to export them customs free to the eu in this case the macedonian clothes would be  cheaper and therefore more competitive for eu markets      the second main area that affects the competitiveness of clothing companies is the area of social policy the labor law has been one of the main concerns of macedonian producers  albatros metro premier and others have complained to our researchers that their “work is cyclical made in specific time period the ‘busy seasons’ and our workers need to work hard during high season sometimes against the legal regulations they have to work saturdays and extra hours whereas the law allows  hours a week” paying overtime increases the company’s labor costs whereas “foreign partners are ready to leave macedonia if the prices are lower for a cent elsewhere” therefore most of the employers in the clothing sector require change in the labor law and the collective agreements allowing work in the clothing sector to be treated as seasonal work others like stipko’s technical director dejan popovski claim that “the labor law is not a problem for us because we work in  shifts  hours each” he blames the others for not planning well the production “the managers are greedy they often overestimate their capacities to deliver”   on the other hand workers feel exploited by the owners of the private apparel companies as they do not get paid for the extra hours of their work they cherish the socialists time when they had to work for only  hours per day and have been earning  euros per month as opposed to the  they earn nowadays the struggle is over the value of the guaranteed minimal salary for the clothing producing sector on the other hand the government responding to the numerous critics from international organizations and the businesses that the labor regulations are not flexible enough adopted a new labor law that entered into force on th september  with this law a more flexible hiring and firing arrangements were introduced   the new labor law requires the employers to pay the overtime and contributions for that overtime in macedonia the social protection and health contributions account for about  of the net salary on the top of it the employers have to pay additional  for the personal income tax this has been a heavy burden to the employers and many of them do not register all their employees some of the workers in the clothing sector complain about overtime abuses when the labor costs are the main factor determining the fate of an industry obviously there is a clash of interests between the managers and the employees concerning workers rights and respecting the laws it is difficult to find a solution to the race to the bottom concept while managers would like to keep prices of production lowest possible the state needs to collect revenues from taxes and keep the social welfare system functioning   export of own goods to the european markets is very far from the plans and actual work of most producers of clothes to be able to design such clothes one needs adequately educated staff managers with a vision and clothing designers a clear vision is in a short supply in stip one of the managers of the stip clothing produces for example bemoaned the perspectives of the integration of macedonia to the eu  as this would only cause the downfall of the clothing producing sector indeed many of the managers of the clothing companies crpm interviewed feel a need to get additional training in management and marketing their knowledge of foreign languages is very low and hardly any of them uses internet moreover although there are few designers in macedonia none of them are educated in making fashion at home this is a general problem it effects both those that want or export own clothes abroad and those who just sew for foreign buyers thus macedonian clothing producers that want to cocontract to make direct deals with foreign buyers need to exhibit clothing samples but there are few who can design their sample shirts there is no school of design in macedonia clearly then the upgrade of the textile production is related with the available human resources which is contingent upon the existence of adequate and good quality educational institution   this leads us to an analysis of the education policy in clothing and textiles majority of the people that live and work in stip are poorly educated the clothing producing workers usually have only primary or at most secondary school but even graduating from high school is a rare occurrence in stip most of the people in this town have elementary education only   municipality total number higher university without unfinished elementary elementary secondary     number  number  number  number  stip            when one considers the state of affairs in the educational sector this is not a surprise the secondary textile school in stip can serve as an example closely cooperated with makedonka for years together with the secondary school in tetovo it is the oldest institution teaching students the textile and the apparel trade  each year about  students graduate  from a four year program and  from a three year program there is a lack of space for practical instruction ie apparel work as there are only  workshops for that purpose that is why students are sent to practice in five apparel companies vabo elena mavis viteks and beas however there due to various reasons they are not allowed to practice much and are typically only let to observe the apparel production due to the lack of space it is “an art to properly train the students of apparel production” another related problem is the old machines used in the workshops   an institution that should be teaching design is the macedonian institute for textiles in skopje the institute exists for  years in the past it had a study program in textile engineering due to a dramatic decline in the basic textile production and a decreased interest for enrollment in this program in the academic year  a program for clothing engineers was opened however even though the program name was changed the teaching staff and the curriculum essentially remained the same the program has very old curricula that does not offer graduate students design skills paradoxically the curriculum is heavy on mathematics chemistry and physics and there are only two design related courses and no management and marketing courses   moreover the program offers almost no practical exercises in clothing manufacturing  this is costly to organize as it requires equipment time and space as well as experience in manufacturing clothes which unfortunately the university professors do not have in the same tie their colleagues in romania work in computer labs operating with cad and cam machines there is a lack of interest to enroll in the program even the quota of places offered with free tuition is not filled at the time of enrollment just two students have graduated so far the students testify that “even after graduation they have not seen how clothes are manufactured so how would they know to resolve any manufacturing problem” since this is a public institution the government should consider modernizing it as quickly as possible in fact there is interest in such kind of education although in macedonia there is not a design school there are  educated designers most of them graduates from the florence based academia italiana the same school is interested in opening a branch in strumica since this is a matter of long term interest the public policy concerning this initiative should be aimed at reducing legal or political barriers for opening this academy   the clothing sector as the overall industry does not have a defined strategy that will be conducive to growth and innovation and enhance the economic competitiveness of macedonian clothing the ministry of economy has in its jurisdiction to create a coherent policy and regulatory framework for the textile and clothing sector the ministry has an industrial department within which only one person specifically overlooks the developments in the industry that contributes with  of the total exports and employs every tenth macedonian this section of the industrial department of the ministry after fifteen years finally succeeded in receiving  million denars  euros in  from swiss compensation funds to cover the expenses of an expert eam that will develop the new textile strategy and if the tendering process did not stall in the bureaucratic labyrinths of the ministry by october  macedonia would have had a textile strategy now the  stip based textile companies and many others will have to wait until no specific date in  for the guidelines of their sector’s future development to be prepared macedonia does not have an industrial strategy document and needs to define an industrial strategy encouraging growth and enhancing economic competitiveness what better way to start preparing an overall industrial strategy but by writing such a plan for the sector that produces the most export items in the country       appendix list of stip companies and the number of workers       no company  director kind of

program  november  interview   date february  place skopje macedonia  occasional paper n  occasional paper n    the history of the macedonian textile industry with a focus on shtip    introduction the early beginnings and developments until    the growth of the macedonian textile sector underwent diverse historical and economic phases this industry is among the oldest on the territory of macedonia and passed through all the stages of development at the end of the th century macedonia was a territory with numerous small towns with a developed trade especially in craftsmanship zanaetchistvo the majority of the population lived in rural areas macedonia characterized as an agricultural country where most of the inhabitants satisfied their needs through own production of food the introduction and the further development of the textile industry in macedonia were mainly induced by the needs of the ottoman army for various kinds of clothing and uniforms  another reason for the emerging of the textile sector was to satisfy the needs of the citizens in the urban areas an important factor for the advancement of this industry at that time was the developed farming cattle breeding in particular stocharstvo the first textile enterprises were established in the ’s in the villages in the region of bitola – dihovo magarevo trnovo and their main activity was production of woolen products only a small number of cotton products were produced in zanaetciski craftsmen workshops the growth of textiles in this region was natural as bitola at that time also known as manastir was an important economic and cultural center in the european part of turkeyi at that time the owners and managers of the textile industry were businessmen with sufficient capital to invest their money in industrial production these companies showed good results and their business had a bright perspective unfortunately the balkan wars and the first world war had devastating results for this industry one of the first textile companies in the territory of republic of macedonia was the textile and knitting trikotazna factory in the village dihovo  the factory was built in  and represented one of the largest textile factories in the european part of the ottoman empire the investment in this factory was estimated to be  golden turkish liras yet this was a huge amount to be invested by one person so the owners established a joint stock company akcionersko drustvo that financed the building of the factory they produced mostly woolen products with modern production processes the company used mostly domestic wool in order to produce highquality products they also imported wool from england the final products were sold in most of the major cities in the region bitola thessalonica solun skopje istanbul izmir smirna duras drach the factory was closed in  when the bulgarian army in control of macedonia at the time took the machinery to the towns of sliven and gabrovo in bulgaria at the end of th and beginning of th century there were ten other textile workshops unfortunately they were all shut down and destroyed during the first world war beside woolen products there was also production of cotton products however this sector could not develop much in macedonia at this time because of high competition from the european cotton producers another negative factor for the growth of cotton production was the low purchasing power of the macedonian population only in the period between  and  the cotton producing industry grew more significantly             in macedonia the modern production in the silk industry began at the end of the nineteenth century the main centers for silk cocoon kozhurci were the regions of gevgelija dojran strumica and radovish the first factory for processing silk cocoon odmotacnica na svileni kozurci was established in  in gevgelija the factory was the property of the sultan hamid the machinery was brought from italy and assembled by italian experts at that time the employees worked for  to  hours per day and the total number of employees was  all of them from gevgelija there were also women among them the factory shut down at the beginning of the balkan wars in  and it was destroyed in the first world war this war had serious consequences for the silk processing business svilarstvoto because they were very close to the military front many inhabitants from the region of gevgelija and dojran moved toward the inner parts of macedonia looking for a secure place to live these people left their workshops and began to work in other professions therefore the end result in the silk processing industry was similar to the story of the woolen processing failure at the end of first world war new economic conditions were created with the partition of macedonia in  confirmed at the versailles in  the economy stagnated and the development of the textile industry in what is today the republic of macedonia discontinued part of the investments in this industry remained at the other side of the new borders and part of it was destroyed in the war the macedonian textile industry could not be revived and developed because of the interests of strong competitors from serbia croatia and slovenia as macedonians in the kingdom of yugoslavia were not even recognized as a nation the country renamed vardarska banovina it was obvious that the macedonian industrial development was not a priority for the yugoslav rulers in fact in the inter war period only two small textile industrial companies were renewed “sterjo pikulis” in the village magarevo producing cloth and laces za shtofovi i gajtani and “petar lekikj” in tetovo producing laces gajtani in the period  there were  textile producing companies established

various types of cotton cloth per year for one shift   the initial development of the macedonian textile industry indicates two major phases the first phase  is characterized with a slower developmentonly five enterprises were established and two of them shut down the second phase  indicates more intensive development with nine established enterprises out of these established enterprises seven were based in skopje an economic and administrative center which attracted domestic and foreign capital the companies in the macedonian textile sector at that time did ginning of silk weaving of cloth made of cotton wool and artificial silk knitting and else the most important industrial facilities were the weaving mills of cotton products before the war the textile companies were small enterprises there was a disproportion between the capacities of the spinning and weaving mills the only enterprise that owned a spinning mill was the company for processing wool and cotton in strumica this situation was partly due to the high costs of investments needed for founding spinning mills in addition the return on investment was higher on weaving mills investors in the past as today were interested only in profits and for there is no surprise that for a period of time only investments in weaving mills were being made the late appearance of the textile industry in the interwar period was due to the lack of capital industrial energy and skilled workers some foreign companies offered cotton and silk yarn for a lower price than those offered to their domestic markets with a payment period of one to six months an important thing to be mentioned is that most of the macedonian industrial machines were bought secondhand from the economically more developed countries – croatia czechoslovakia and germany these machines were old and in some cases the amortization was over  this resulted in lower productivity rates and the employment of more work force in  the first company that worked with  and later with  gins was “tulbend” from skopje the total capital invested in the textile industry in fixed assets – land buildings and machines at the end of  was  yugoslav dinars approximately  us dollars at that time or  us dollars today when calculating the amount using a gdp deflatoriii or  of the total investment in industry and mining in  of the companies more than  dinars  us  were invested while in the other  of companies  dinars  us  were invested the textile industry took the fourth place by investments after the food electric distribution and tobacco industry in  the macedonian textile sector employed  people or  of the industrial employmentiv the wages were very low until  the minimum wage not even specified in  the minimum wage was fixed to  dinars per hour five american dollar cents but the supply of workers was so high that even this wage was decreased the macedonian textile industry went through a continuous growth in the inter war period the production especially increased in the second half of this period at that time new industrial enterprises were established – “tulbend” in skopje the textile factory “vardar” also in skopje the textile factory skopje etc in this period most of the products were made of cotton although production of woolen items was also kept  the total output of the textile industry in  equaled to  dinars where  were woolen products or  of the total production of textile sector              textile and apparel industries in macedonia during sfr yugoslavia and today   investment   with the five year planning program the sfry government has decided to change the macedonian economy from primarily craftsmanship to industry therefore investment in several key sectors was made production of electricity metallurgy chemistry industry tobacco industry leather industry food processing and textile according to the five year plan most investments were made in ‘production of electricity   than textile industry   and nonmetal industry with  of total investment in the industry sector in the period between ’v in textile industry in macedonia two huge capacities were built teteks in tetovo and makedonka in shtip the former planned to produce woolen yarn and fabrics and cloths the later was planned to spin cotton yarn and weave cotton cloth this provided for balanced textile production which in the previous period was disproportionate  the investment highly contributed to increase of employment and thus if in  the textile sector employed just  people  of total employment in the whole industryvi in  after the capacities in shtip and tetovo were built the employment in the textile sector amounted to  people or vii of total industrial employment      output   in socialist times the textile and the apparel industries in macedonia grew continuously in the period  to  the growth was particularly strong between  and  the index rising from  to        although the growth in the industrial production in these industries and especially in the textiles sector slowed down in the ’s the positive trend lasted until  in real numbers the production of yarn grew from  tons in  to  in  and  in        similarly the production of cloth grew from  m in  to  in  and the  in  to the whopping  in  and the fascinating  in                    the production of apparel grew from  meters in  to  in   in   in  to  in        with the year  the sharp decline of this industry began the decrease was small in the production of apparel  m in  compared to  in  m but more significant in the textile sector the difference in the produced yarn in tons in  –  and  –  was threefold while the difference in the produced cloth was also substantial  m were made in  while only  in  the decline in the sector apparel production lasted until  stabilizing in the following years until  in the same time the decline in the production of textiles and fabrics was continuous the following figure evidences the decline       the downfall of these sectors however continued after  being more dramatic for the textile sector       figure index of apparel and textile production    in the period before  the share of the macedonian production of textiles and apparel in the yugoslav production also grew the macedonian production of cloth grew from  in  to  of the yugoslav share in  in  it was bigger than the production of bosnia and herzegovina and not much smaller than that of serbia  in macedonia and  in serbia as far as macedonian share of the apparel production in the total yugoslav output is concerned it grew from  in  to  in  to fall somewhat in  to    the decline of the macedonian apparel and textile industry after  is evident if compared to the total macedonian industry while in  the share of the production of textile fibers and fabric industry in the total macedonian industry was   in the  it was  while the share of the production of the industry for production of finished textile products dropped from  in  to  in  therefore in  the relation of both sub sectors in  was  and in  it had changed into  in  the gap has widened to    years share of apparel in gdp share of textiles in gdp            for the  the gross output of the manufacture of textiles was  percent and the production of apparel was  percent of the total gross output of the industryviii within the total industrial production index of industrial production the textile and apparel industries contribute with   manufacture of textiles with   and manufacture of apparel with  ix according to the background study on macedoniax the share of garment industry in macedonian economy in  was   from gdp  production of textile materials and  production of items for clothes for further processing and for drying of fur see table  the ministry of economy estimates that it participates with  in the total number of companies in the economy and contributing to the gdp with over xi   value of textile and apparel production   the value of textile and apparel production put in usd has risen constantly from  million of usd in  through  million of usd in   million of usd in   million of usd in  and reached an imposing  million of usd in  than after the decline in   million of usd the overall value of textile and apparel production has reached its absolute peak in  with tremendous  million of usdxii afterwards the value of textile and apparel production has fallen sharply and “stabilized” in both  and  with  million of usd and  million of usd respectively then the value of production has increased again with  million of usd in  and  million of usd in           employment   these industries also witness decrease in the number of employees as it can be seen from figures  and  the number of workers in these industries had continuously declined in the ’s quite sharply in the textile sector more modestly in the apparel production   figure      figure      the biggest growth in employment in textile and apparel sector has occurred in course of ’s and ’s the number of employees in both sector increased from  in  through  in   in  and  in  to  in  when the transformation process has began on the other hand there were  employed persons in the manufacture of textiles and apparel in   in  and  in  according to official data by the ministry of economy in  there were  employees in the textile and apparel sectorxiii out of those  are workers in the textile and  in the apparel sector despite the decrease in the number of workers which might have had much to do with the overemployment practices during socialist times and of the industrial production the textile and the apparel producing industry are one of the most significant employment sectors in the country as  of the registered employed persons work in these sectorsxiv this industry is a major employer with abut   of the total number of employees in the industrial sectorxv employment wise it is by far the biggest industrial sector thus in the second industrial branch manufacture of food products and beverages there are  workers while in the third the production of metal products there are  employeesxvi   salaries in textile and apparel industryxvii   the combined monthly average salary in both textile and apparel industry amounted to  usd in  and afterwards it has risen to  usd in  and  usd in  then it fell to   usd in  and has increased again in  and  to  usd and  respectively after renewed decline in   usdxviii the average wage in the textile and apparel sector grew to a “record” of  usd in xix after the dissolution of yugoslavia the officially registered salaries in the macedonian textile and apparel industry amounted to  usd in   in  and  usd in            export   apparel and textile production is an important export oriented sector within the macedonia’s exports to the eu in  by far most exported products were exactly the textile products xx the share of textile and apparel in all macedonian exports amounted to  in  textile products   apparel dressing and dyeing of fur  and than it fall to  in  textile products –  apparel dressing and dyeing of fur  afterwards the share of textile and apparel in overall macedonian exports has started to rise and reached  in  textile products   apparel dressing and dyeing of fur    in  textile products –  apparel dressing and dyeing of fur   and  in  textile products –  apparel dressing and dyeing of fur  in this period the share of textile products in the overall macedonian exports has declined constantly while the share of apparel products was growing continuously the total value of exports of textile and apparel products amounted to  million of usd in  textile products –  million usd apparel dressing and dyeing of fur –  million of usd as with the share of the overall exports the  proved to be a critical year in regard to value of the export the combined value amounted to  million usd textile products –  million usd apparel dressing and dyeing of fur –  million of usd the situation has improved in the following years and in  the overall value of exports of textile and apparel products was  million usd textile products –  million usd apparel dressing and dyeing of fur –  million of usd than  million usd in  textile products –  million usd apparel dressing and dyeing of fur –  million of usd and finally  million usd in  textile products   million usd apparel dressing and dyeing of fur   million of usdxxi  on the list of major macedonian export products in the first quarter of  according to the highest rate in the total export value apparel products are four of the top  women blouses leading the list table  this basically means that from the products macedonia exports the most money it gets is for apparel items the biggest export markets in  were germany  greece  usd  italy  holland  belgium  uk  france  slovenia  and other countries  in  apparel and textile exports contributed to  of the total exports of macedonia  and   respectively one can conclude that despite the ’s and early ’s decline the textile and apparel production is the biggest economic sector in macedonia what is important for our study is that today a high concentration of macedonian medium and the large companies twenty is present in the town of stip and that about  of the country’s apparel producers are located in stip       the history of textiles and apparel in shtip “astibo” and “makedonka”    following the second world war macedonia underwent a period of rapid industrialization from the prewar  persons employed in the industrial sector the numbers grew to  in   in   in  and  in  xxiithe cotton processing “makedonka” together with the producer of woolen products “todor cipovski merdzhan teteks” from tetovo and the silk factory “noncha kamishova” from veles was considered as a basis of the development of the macedonian textile industryxxiii the textile factory “pamuchna industrija makedonka was conceived of and formally speaking founded in   based on a business plan by engineer pavel domicelj of the slovenian based tekstil projekt in july  the construction of a colossal object began on an empty field called “ezhova poljana the field of hedgehogs next to the road shtipkochanixxiv the construction was finished in april of  when production of textile fibers was initiated in the spinning plant with  personsxxv most of the machines were new bought from the uk based company platt   picture the colossal object of the factory makedonka built in the early ’s    the compound was thoroughly planned with wardrobes showers a restaurant and a shop an ambulance laboratories and administrative offices at that time it was one of the biggest and most modern factories in the whole sfr yugoslaviaxxvi as a matter of fact in  the gdp of “makedonka” was   of the shtip region ovchepolska okolija and   of this regions’ industry a year later in  makedonka’s share of the gdp was  and  of the gdp of the industry in this regionxxvii the “makedonka” complex included a restaurant serving one free meak for the employees per day three discount stores and a libraryxxviii for the needs of its workers the factory built additionally a complex of apartment buildings so that in  “makedonka” owned  two  room flats and  one  room apartments “makedonka” gave credits with no interests to children of employees that went to universities credits were available for other purposes as wellxxix since  makedonka also had a camp on the shores of the ohrid lake a summer resort on the mountain plachkovica and a hotel at lake dojran the workers using the hotels paid symbolic prices the factory essentially subsidizing the resortsxxx a kud “makedonka” an artistperformers group was also founded in  with around  performances per year  concerts in the town and  elsewhere they won numerous awards diplomas and plaquesxxxi     picture the plaque indicating the beginning of work in makedonka       in the early stages “makedonka” lacked educated personnel in  when the factory had a total of  workers only  had “high qualificationsskills”  had basic qualificationsskills and  were semiskilled while  had no skillsqualificationsxxxii thus for the needs of the factory in  a industriskotehnichko uchilishte and in  a tekstilnotehnichko uchilishte were opened in  these schools were closed instead a uchilishen centar za obrazovanie na kadri od tekstilna struka was openedxxxiii also within the rabotnichki univerzitet specialized technical courses were organized for the education of workers in  about  workers followed these coursesxxxiv within “makedonka” in  a centar za struchno obrazovanie na rabotnicite was opened aimed at further education and specialization of the workers the factory also gave various stipends  in total for   in  for example to students from secondary and vocational schools as well as university students the development of the company was not only marked by an increase of size but also by the introduction of new production lines in  the weaving plant ‘tkaechnica’ and in  the enrichment capacity ‘oblagorodilnicadorabotuvachki kapaciteti’ sections were added to the spinning mill while in  another section was integrated in the factory the ‘vigonj predilnica’ kind of a spinning mill thus the company grew from a spinning mill unit to a cotton fiber processing prerabotka na pamuchni tkaenini company “makedonka” produced three different kind of products yarn raw fabrics and final products ‘predivo surova tkaenina gotov proizvod’ its design unit grew so that in   different patterns and designs were made while at the beginning years they could not make more than  in  “makedonka” built the factory for the production of jeans buying the license to produce wrangler from the usxxxv “makedonka” profited from the fact that at that time cotton was grown in the shtip region and all around the countryxxxvi although the data shown here documents the production since  cotton was produced in this country for a long time there is evidence that shtip had many cotton fields at the end of the xix centuryxxxvii during yugoslav times macedonia alone supplied  of the cotton consumption in the federation as can be observed from table  cotton was produced in macedonia in great quantitiesxxxviii the peak in the cotton production was in the early ’sxxxix   figure cotton production until  total production in tons     the significance of this company was so high that the supreme yugoslav leader josip broz tito visited it in may   the factory products were sold all over former yugoslavia and were exhibited at industry fairs in zagreb and leskovac “makedonka” had partners throughout the country such as “ateks” “srbijateks” tekstilpromet”zagreb “slavonijateks” osijek “tekstil” and “veletekstil” from ljubljana “stoteks” from kraljevo “nishpromet” from nish and “trgotekstil” and “skopski magazin” from skopje as well as representative offices in seven cities of former yugoslavia belgrade kraljevo zagreb sarajevo ljubljana shtip novi sadxl at that time  of the production was contract manufacturingxli the deals were made through intermediaries such as “makoteks” from skopje and “tekstil” from zagreb a small part of the deals were done through “jugotekstil” ljubljana “centrotekstil” belgrade thus as early as  the company began exporting in  one of the successful years the company exported half of its production about   of the export production was sold to burma and   to western germany xlii while in early ’s its export was worth more than  million us dollars the main role seems to have been inneryugoslav trade in  the factory exported  of its production in  “makedonka” exported for the amount of  million dinars while in the first months of  the exports were worth  million dinars out of which  million in the western marketsxliii  in  “makedonka” exported  million usdxliv in the ’s the idea for joining forces with other textile and apparel companies was realized and “makedonka” become part of the “inteks” conglomeratexlv indeed “makedonka” invested in the establishment of the following factories the weaving plants “maleshevka” from berovo “ovche pole” from sveti nikole the apparel producers “partizanka” from delchevo “alkoloid” from berovo and the weaving plant and manufacturer of terrycloth towels beach towels bedding and bathrobes “frotirka” from delchevo all three berovo delchevo and sveti nikole are very small mountainous towns located in the eastern region of macedonia the idea was that these factories would economically use the cloth produced by “makedonka”xlvi the apparel producer “astibo” also started out as a production line of “makedonka” in fact the textile industry of shtip was pertinent to development of other industrial capacities in the region   map of macedonia with berovo delchevo and sveti nikole    in the first year of its existence “makedonka” employed a total of  personsxlvii growing continuously  in  the factory had already grown to a total of  workers while in  the number of employed persons in “makedonka” grew to xlviii most of the workers were young only   being older than  at that stage by a state command many villagers from shtip area were made to work in the textile factory hence in  the factory grew to a total of  workers while in the early ’s the number of employed persons in “makedonka” grew to xlix in mid ’s it employed  workersl in  there were  employees  of which with university degrees  highly skilled  skilled  semiqualified and  with no skills  high school graduates  primary school graduates etcli the number grew to  persons in  and  in lii in  it employed  people and produced  million meters of raw and  million meters of finishing fabricsliii the maximum number of workers registered in “makedonka” was  in liv since then the number continued to decrease until the liquidation of the company in    year “makedonka” number of workers     early ’s  mid ’s              december      the story of astibo    having “makedonka” produce fabrics and cloth it came natural that an apparel company is also foundedlv thus “astibo” was founded in  as a department within “makedonka” with  employees and grew quicklylvi at the beginning the company was situated in the emptied depots of the tobacco company “monopol” in  it had  employees and was transformed as an autonomous socialist entity a socalled ‘oozt’ boal in english oozt stands for basic organization of associated labor mihail nedkov becoming the director at this time there was a world recession which hit the textile industry and makedonka’s production units outside of shtip in other towns of eastern macedonia as well as “astibo” got an autonomous status “astibo” at that time was called oozt “konfekcija makedonka shtip” only in  however with the organizational reorganization of the boals “mashka programamladost” “solidarnost” “zhenska programa” “egzotik” “detska programapinki” “galaksija” “opshtestvena ishrana” and “astibo komerc” “astibo” became a separate company a “rabotna organizacija modna konfekcija” work organisation for fashion astibolvii astibo’s core business was the design production and distribution of men’s women’s and children’s readymade garments in  “astibo” had about  employed persons following a policy recommendation to open branches in underdeveloped regions of the country in order to absorb a high number of unemployed persons there “astibo” founded production units in a number of towns mainly in the eastern part of macedonia such as makedonski brod “brodchanka” probishtip “proteks” sveti nikole “astibo”sveti nikole kriva palanka “palanchanka” radovish “radovishanka” vinica “vinichanka” kratovo “kratovchanka” and makedonska kamenica “vera jocikj”lviii many of these units opened in the eastern regions of macedonia like “vera jocikj” were established as a result of the communist leadership decision to employ the spouses of the men working in the mine pits in eastern macedonia and despite the lack of interest in this endeavor by “astibo” itselflix taking into account all workers in shtip and elsewhere there were a total of  workers employed in astibo a decade after it was established the conglomerate became the biggest producer of light casual apparel in all yugoslavia and one of the top five producers of apparel overall with  own shops throughout the countrylx at this time astibo began exporting its production making contracts with foreign buyers “manufacturing preordered items already paid by the partners abroad”lxi exactly in this period  “production of textile and garment sharply decreased in the old industrial regions which underwent a process of ‘deindustrialization’ while peripheral regions in south and east with or without textile tradition were chosen for new investment in textile and garment production”lxii by  “astibo” exported half of its productionlxiii in  “astibo” exported goods worth  million usd lxiv the following year the exports were worth  million usdlxv in the first eight months of  “astibo” exported  million usdlxvi the factory grew and in  it had  employeeslxvii in the early ’s “astibo” had  workers and was well known throughout former yugoslavialxviii “astibo” grew so much that it had a health care institution zdavstvena stanica a restaurant and a day care center for the employee’s children detska ustanovalxix how well organized the factory was at that time we can see by the fact that the health care institution had a unit for gynecological treatment offering among others counseling about the use of contraceptives a lab a pediatrician and a dentist unit lxx the company became an additional important element for the town’s life as it built apartments for the workers had its own restaurant and kindergarten for the children of the employees in total the whole complex of buildings of “astibo” was  square meters the company also had a “b” category hotel “garni”  rooms  doubles and  singles in the center of shtip built in  in the ’s “astibo” provided  million yugoslav dinars for stipends and credits for the studies of the children of the employeeslxxi    the decline and the fall of makedonka    although decorated with a special medal by tito in  “makedonka” had a number of problems that lead to its decline in the ’s and collapse a decade laterlxxii as “makedonka” produced basic fabrics from cotton much of it was produced by local agricultural workerslxxiii the problems for “makedonka” began when from  onwards as you can see from the figure bellow a significant drop in the cotton production occurred in macedonia starting with the ’s the factory increasingly relied on the import of basic materials such as cottonlxxiv what were the reasons for the decrease of cotton production in macedonia in the early ’s there was huge optimism regarding the future of macedonian cotton industry the dams in vodoca and tulija were built providing a complete system for irrigation necessary for increasing the production of cotton crops while also  harvester machinescombines kombajni have been bought form ussr for agricultural cooperatives zik’s from various parts of the republiclxxv in fact an increase in the production of cotton crops was necessary since almost the then entire production was used by “strumicanka” and “makedonka” however the optimism was short lived and a decrease of the production of cotton occurred despite the improvement of some of the factors influencing production such as irrigation the production of cotton was highly exhausting the growing up period long and the profits very low in comparison to required work additionally part of the problem was that the mentioned  combines were at the disposal of the zik’s but not of the individual producers who were forced to grow their crops manually of cotton who were dominant in cotton sector there were also not enough machines for separating the cotton seeds from the fibers masini za oddeluvanje na vlakno i seme moreover on the world markets of cotton in the early ’s some major producers such as australia emerged while others such as china india and brazil had a significant increase in their yield lowering the prices of this commodity when in the ’s china began integrating its economy to the global markets the supplies of cotton and in that regard also the stocks of cotton grew significantly and this automatically affected the world cotton prizes and led to their droplxxvi thus as there was a significant drop of the price on world market of cotton in the early ’s in macedonia it became commercially more viable to import cotton from socialist partners in egypt or the ussr instead of producing its own one in the ’s almost all the cotton used in “makedonka” was importedlxxvii  in fact “makedonka” exported fabrics to the eastern block in exchange of cotton in the first five months of  the exports to the former socialist block worth  million dinars were used to obtain cottonlxxviii in the mid ’s about  of the cotton used for production were imported lxxix figure deflated cotton prices indices  source agricultural commodities profiles and relevant wto negotiating issues    as a result the macedonian farmers decreased the production of cotton and gradually switched to cultivating other more profitable agricultural products in the course of time the new facilities dams system of irrigation and equipment were used for purposes of growing ranogradinarski products today the institute for agriculture in strumica institut za juzni zemjodelski kulturi is practically the sole place in macedonia where cotton is still being grown and for scientifically purposes onlylxxx      figure cotton production in macedonia      as the production decreased after  less regions were producing cotton so that by  veles produced  kavadarci  gevgelija  and valandovo strumica region  tons while from  to  valandovo was the only region where cotton was produced in the country in  cotton was not anymore grown anywhere in macedonia another of the core problems was the overemployment in the factory as a result of party influence on the economy the massive industrialization in the post war period was undertaken without much concern over the actual need of employed persons more persons were employed in the new factories than needed and the productivity was lower than the optimal onelxxxi already in the early ’s for example the economic logic for establishing weaving plants and apparel producers using the “makedonka” fabrics proved wrong as the satellite factories in berovo sveti nikole and delchevo began making losses yet these and other plants derogatorily referred to as “politichki fabriki political factories” had to be opened in order to absorb the high number of unemployed persons in this regionlxxxii the yearly losses of the berovo factory for  were estimated at  million yugoslav dinars the second factor influencing the economic decline of the factory was bad management the third factor causing the decline of the “makedonka” is located in the yugoslav economic difficulties throughout the ’s and the early ’s and the collapse of the market caused by the wars of the dissolution of the federal republic in the ’s the company was not making profits but the system had to pay the wages of the workers to pay the salaries the management obtained funds through loans from various banks even from the mining company sasa from makedonska kamenica the oldest two production facilities the spinning and the weaving one predilnica and tkaechnica made losses and a possible solution was to split the factory into smaller units however the senior management led by the manager panche brashnarov in the period  refused any changes of the structure of “makedonka” even if they would have helped the economically healthier parts of the factory survive the pending transformation easierlxxxiii the wars and the disintegration of yugoslavia negatively affected the working of the factory as in the early ’s not only there was a collapse of the yugoslav market for which the company was positioned but more importantly “makedonka” could not realize its financial claims from firms throughout the former yugoslavialxxxiv in  delcho lazarov became the new manager generalen director and he was ready to start active bankruptcy proceeding in cooperation with the government according to the liquidation program prepared by macedonian government the same year the two most problematic units the spinning and weaving plants were supposed to be liquidated and sold to interested parties    the decline parts of makedonka today    as “makedonka” continued to make financial losses in the early ’s it was included in the special restructuring program of  biggest loss  making companies in the countrylxxxv the government aimed at a reorganization of the company and tackling the overemployment issue through a program of the world bank the funds provided by this program as a let off money for the overemployed in the makedonka amounted to us  million lxxxvi  zivko tolevski the union leader of “makedonka” did not agree with this solution and organized a new strike there was a commotion and the process of liquidation was postponed while production went on for a while despite losses the salaries were paid by loans for which the collateral provided were parts of the nonessential property of “makedonka” such a situation was unsustainable and the workers were forced to take a leave and receive  of their wages     the laying off was conducted in two phases so that in march  in the employment bureau in shtip a financial compensation and layoff money to a second group of  dismissed workers  from makedonka were paid the  workers have been declared technological surplus in makedonkalxxxvii in october  the government decided to initiate the process of privatization  according to a decision of the government commission for transformation of public enterprises which have considered the reports of the process to date of transformation of  of  lowproducing enterprises seven such firms received the “goahead” for privatization one of them being makedonka from stiplxxxviii the following year the agency for privatization decided to transfer the debts of “makedonka” to eight separate legal entities which were evolved from the separate departments of the factory however the eight new entities also made losses and continued with poor economic performance since the reorganized separate entities did not work well in the following years either in  the government initiated a bankruptcy procedure the winner of the international tender was zoran krstevski an italian with a macedonian background he planned to reorganize the factory step by step to replace the old machines by new italian ones and to reemploy “makedonka” workers he wanted the legal proceedings of buying the company completed as soon as possible but was faced with organized protests by the workers who did not even allow him to enter the premises of the factories he was to buy upon such a welcome mr krstevski decided not to invest in “makedonka” and the first attempt of privatization failed later on there were also unsuccessful efforts to privatize the company through the model of managerworkers buyoutlxxxix      although privatization seemed as the most viable solution by  none of the units of “makedonka” was yet privatized due to as some maintained “the governments undefined attitude towards companies that have been making losses and which should have been sold or closed long ago as required by international monetary experts have prevailed”xc the main problem with the privatization of “makedonka” was the fact that since the changes of the political system and the beginning of the decline of the company the machines the other equipment and the facilities have not been maintained regularly and any buyer had to make huge investments to repair them and restart productionxci by the end of the year the government decided to liquidate “makedonka” selling it piece by piece at the time of liquidation in  the company had  workers registered   by  one by one the new legal entities springing from the different makedonka’s units had been privatized as follows    the “makedonka” privatized unitsxcii number of employedxciii bought by legal entity individual used today by number of employed in

worked in this unit of ad tkaechnica when mrivanovski bought “politeks” there were  workers of which only five were employed by the new owner the workers hope that the new owner of “ad jeans” the selling of which is scheduled for th of september  will take interest in “politeks” and buy it tooxcvi a big part of the “ad tkaechnica” of about  m was rented out on a ten year lease to the greek company “proteks as”xcvii this company’s primary activity is the production of wool yarn from raw wool intended for carpet production according to the manager petar dimitrovski currently the number of employees is  but after one year of preparation they are planning to start with the production in the summer and employ another  people former “makedonka” workersxcviii for the beginning of production they plan to import raw material wool from greece but also to buy such from macedonia in the future the installed capacity production is about  tones per month and the plan is that the entire production is sold at foreign markets uk mainly and germany and denmark the machines for production are twenty years old made in italy and belgium moved to “makedonka’ from the other company of the owner based in larissa the maintaining of the machines and the transport is provided by the greek owner  by the end of august “proteks as” started with trial production of wool yarn employing  peoplexcix yet another part of ad “tkaechnica” was bought by the shtip apparel producer “eam” according to the owner of ad tkaenini slave ivanovski it is most profitable to rent or sell parts of this former “makedonka” unitc he would like to make “makedonka” a duty free zone and to attract foreign investors another idea he has is to turn the “makedonka” complex into a university although he has different ideas what to do with this property he is sure not interested in opening an apparel producing unit there fearing cheap chinese imports in the ad jeans  denim there are  textile companies that produce today “textil invest denim” with  workers producing cloth for a turkish company and ”tekstil invest jeans” producing lohnveredelung clothes the apparel producer “mikoteks” rents out the

“maksima” rents out the  former ad opshtestveni standardi the company that bought ad opshtestveni standardi “preciz” is now also the owner of the hotel ”makedonka” on the lake dojran the kindergarten the restaurant and three shops furthermore in october  blagoja temelkovski became new owner of the former “ad ros” establishing a new company ecm to run this unitci their primary activity is reparation and maintenance of electric machines transformers and production of mechanical parts the new owner inherited the old machines and until now did not invest in buying new and modern machines finally riste micev is the owner of the former ad energetika does not want to rent the locality because this unit supplies energy to the other firms and makes profit out of itcii             during the liquidation of “makedonka” much of the equipment was disbanded and stolen during the privatization process when the trustee was dimitar adzhiev eight of the newer machines were relocated to the textile factory “astibo” from berovo  there is no document testifying if the machines were sold or rented outciii although the police was informed no investigation was initiated many people from shtip know that part of the machines from “makedonka” are in berovo it is a public secret the other machines from “makedonka” were left to the new owners to decide what to do with some of them were quite new in  in the “oblagoroduvanje finishing” unit  new machines were bought from switzerland worth around million euros these were up to date models and no other company in macedonia had such machines the new owners of ad “tkaechnica” however did not find much use of these machines and disbanded them and sold them as scrap metal in macedonia and bulgaria in the “ad predilnica” the faith of the machines was no different bulldozers coming in destroying them before being sold as useless metal sostojbata ne bila poinakva only the machines from “ad ros” survived the transition and are still used for production       the decline and the transformation of astibo     in the early ’s “astibo” had problems with sales on the domestic markets as payments from wholesale retailers were regulated to be made within a time framework of  days the rampant yugoslav inflation at that time depreciated much of the money received at the actual time of payment therefore the management decided to step up exports insteadciv so once in the early ’s “astibo” faced financial difficulties it began working on the basis of the “lohnveredelung” production this job was easy to do as the foreign partners mainly german ones provided all the necessary materials and “astibo” had to do only stitching and sewing unlike the ’s “astibo” now did not need anymore to develop own products and sell them to foreign partners neither it had to purchase the materials for manufacturingcv already at that time about  of the yugoslav apparel producers worked with contract manufacturing producing preordered apparel by western companiescvi in  about  of all the “astibo” exports were with the lohnveredelung system exports amounted to  of all production and were worth  million usd  of which made on the western markets cvii to facilitate the process in april  “astibo” becomes part of the “inteks” conglomeratecviii meanwhile the number of workers of “astibo” grew to the record number of  in cix    year “astibo” number of workers         early ’s    end of ’s    at this time  of the production was exported by  “astibo” had grown into an independent business operating seven independent factories on a single site which during the s before the company ran into financial difficulties produced an estimated  million finished garments per year at that time over  of production was lohnveredelungworkcontract manufacturing exported to western europe including germany the netherlands denmark and belgium and the usa the own production was sold through the chain  retail stores throughout former yugoslavia in general “astibo” was a relatively successful company before the collapse of the old system after the dissolution of yugoslavia in february  in independent macedonia the units outside of shtip became independent firms while “astibo” became a joint stockholding company akcionersko drushtvocx in the period of transition the management founded a number of new limited liability companies drushtva so ogranichena odgovornost such as “astimpeks” “astiprom” “astigros” “astiboturs” and “astibilans” a number of factors lead to astibo’s collapse in the ’s  one of the most important related to the regional turbulences and the wars of yugoslav succession which disrupted trade contacts with western buyers of apparel “astibo” also could not realize its financial claims from firms throughout the former yugoslaviacxi on the other hand overemployment was a great problem as the company had way too many employees than needed in the ’scxii overemployment was a burden of the past due to the massive employing of youth in the ’s at that time the management boasted that “we will hire new employees because we have plenty of orders…what will happen when there will be no more orders we will think about this when such times come”cxiii the management was not much concerned about long terms effects of employing huge amounts of workers in the late ’s and early ’s the company faced a negative trend and began accumulating debtcxiv if during socialist times the issue could be put aside following the changes of the political system the problems came into surface the ratio between workers and administration was not helping efficient work either as for example in the end of the ’s out of the  workers up to  were employed in the nonmanufacturing section of the companycxv in addition bad management decisions and surplus capacity also influenced the break down of the profitable business and led to the company’s insolvencycxvi in the second half of the ’s “astibo” had run up  million euros’ debt to the state institutions and various private firms while the contributions for the social and health insurance had not been paid for a number of yearscxvii losing the yugoslav markets in the early ’s the factory unsuccessfully attempted to enter the western markets selling its own brand according to branko georgiev deputy manager zamenik director of tlm canda and former director of “astibo” although the company registered a brand of its own in germany “astibode” it failed to find partners to buy their products the lack of good contacts contributed to the fall of this initiative as mrgeorgiev put it “it is difficult to ‘conquer’ western markets we did not have the right person in germany and failed that it is how it works in the socalled open markets”cxviii the economic difficulties of “astibo” led the government to initiate in april  a transformation of the company by founding a council for transformation and preparing a program of action the then general director mrpanche  nasev together  with his  associates  unsuccessfully negotiated with the government the possibilities for the  current managing  team of  astibo to buy the majority sharescxix the company continued to make losses from  onwards in  the company’s value was estimated at  million deutschmarks but the question how to privatize the company remained as the workers were against managerial buyout and organized strikes to assert their opinion only in may  the government consulting the management of the company decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in “astibo” the company was liquidated in a speedy procedure on th of july  and a tender was called at this time astibo had  workers in the following units the apparel factories are bolded     astibo number of employedcxx number

total         at the time of the sale “astibo” was estimated by the government to be worth  million euros much less than the first assessment of value characteristically in the ’s the value and the price of the macedonian public companies offered for sale decreased as the time passed and the privatization was kept postponed the loss making enterprises not only made losses but also their assets suffered depreciation so also “astibo”  the winner of the the tender was mr kocho mocan who was to buy the company for  euros he however failed to pay the money in the legal timeframe and the tender and the sale were cancelled in the end of  a new tender was opened there were no contractual conditions of sale concerning reemployment of workers or future investment in the plant in either of the tenders the only criterion for the selection of a purchaser was the price offered for the assets in addition the government covered the unpaid social contributions and paid severance pay to the laid off workers depending on the amount years in service the debts to the different parties were to be paid by the proceeds from the sale of the companycxxii the company was bought by a consortium of nine companies which paid  euros each member of the consortium paid a share according to the size of the objects bought the sum ranging from   to   euroscxxiii   companies that have bought the formerly socialist enterprise of “astibo”   “astibo” “lars” “eskada” “linea” “be” “elena” labod “modena” “mont” “vabo” “milano” “vit”    over  workers began to work in the new enterprises based in “astibo” about  of them former “astibo” employers the new owners have also renovated the factory investing more than euro  million they compensated the local government the accumulated debts for water usage by leaving to them the local astibo hotel while the two shops in shtip were given as a compensation for accumulated debts to the electricity provider and to the bread and pastry maker “zhitoleb”cxxiv     the situation in the apparel and textiles production in shtip today   what is the situation in the textiles and apparel sector in shtip today  let us start with the basic question how many such producers exist nowadays it was very difficult to ascertain how many textile and apparel enterprises are there in shtip in conversations people from shtip often claim that there are  to  “konfekcii” apparel producers  even but this number showed to be highly exaggerated in fact crpm was able to identified only  apparel and textile producers in the town of shtip this number might not be absolutely correct as some firms especially small ones work outside of the system while others might have gone bankrupt by now viteks but this number can be considered quite reliable under current circumstances see the full list of the textile and apparel producers from the town at the end of the paper table acxxv interestingly only  apparel producers have newly built facilities vivendi albatros and vabo while many use buildings of former socially owned enterprises soe shtipko for instance is situated in facilities of former soe progres – factory for metal products mavis works in an old building of

companies that work in the facilities of astibo and makedonka furthermore stilteks anateks and tomas stil are located in private houses nana in a shopping center old soe while longurov works in a depot of “makpromet” thirteen companies are located in the premises of astibo and makedonka the machines of the apparel producers are typically being serviced by former technicians from “makedonka” and “astibo” only a handful companies actually employing a person responsible for this activity most of the machines are usually bought from turkey and are yuki type made in japancxxvi   picture apparel production line   in the mentioned  companies there are  workers which imply that the percentage of persons employed in the apparel and textiles sectors within the shtip economy is quite high about  of the shtip employed if one considers that there are a number of persons from shtip that work in industries that are related to the apparel and textile sectors such as transport and logistics catering for the workers etc it is easy to the significance of the sectors on the shtip’s economy moreover shtip is the biggest center of apparel and textile production in macedonia it has more workers employed in these sectors than skopje with  workers tetovo with  gevgelija  bitola with  and strumica with cxxvii apparel and textile production is in shtip companies very much focused upon “outward processing production as only one eam has its own production marketed through own export channels while  tomas stil and stilteks small firms with  employees sewing pants have own products for sale at the domestic markets additionally a number of companies produce a small share of their products for domestic markets or for own export gracija with about  own production mond  beass  briteks  milanomodena  zenvivendi  and sthipko  a vast majority of shtip apparel and textile producers manufacture “light apparel casual” such as shirts blouses tshirts etc production that demands very little fixed investments and therefore is vulnerable to market shifts and asian competition with much cheaper labor costs a smaller number of producers  such as anateks kitgo starteks beass starteks shtipko dona stilteks ziziteks makteks and galija manufacture only or predominantly jackets coats and other more sophisticated semiheavy and “heavy apparel tailored” this production is less exposed to market vulnerability due to higher transport costs needs more skilled labor and more capital investment zenvivendi and mond too produce heavy and semiheavy apparel but only in addition to light textiles which is still their dominant activity a number of shtip based companies produce a small share of their products for domestic markets or for own export gracija with about  own production mond  beass  briteks  milanomodena  zenvivendi  and sthipko   this leaves the industry in shtip lagging behind the world trend in designing and branding which is a new economic activity everywhere in the region from serbia nikola’s mona st george etc through bulgaria few companies produce under own brand for domestic market only daphne odeta albena style and etc to turkey little big mavi jeans tac and etc and romania where the government through investments stimulated the industry to produce their own collections for the domestic market and for export such as xandra and anrolf shtip has few value added products and currently does mostly ‘sewing and stitching’ most of the companies are small and midsize and the workers are skilled in simple cut and make techniques needed for the production of “light clothes”       the losers of the transformation    the clear loser of the transformation of the shtip textile and apparel sectors are the workers in these industries while the owners and the managers of the apparel companies enjoy better live their fortunes have not been as bright as those in the new and quickly developing branches of these sectors such as logistics and intermediaries the winners of the transformation are those managers and sector leaders who have invested in the most valued added type of activities including marketing logistics and transport mihajlo nikolovskicxxviii worked

have apparel and a transporting company andon has a spouse and two children his wife being the director of the transportation firm they have annual profit of about  thousand euros and andon complains that the expenses of the business have been perpetually increasing in the last few years nevertheless he satisfied with the profit which leaves the lack of free time their only inconvenience at the moment  his family lives in the house he inherited from his father since they are not yet in a position to build a new one the family does not go on holidays frequently they prefer the weekend trips instead most of the times andon’s family goes for holidays to ohrid and rarely in greece with his earnings he is able to meet all of the expenses for the children primarily education food and clothing currently he drives fiat punto from  and that’s the only car the family possesses marko and jovanka tomovski are a couple in their late ’s jovanka is a former worker of “astibo” while her husband used to work in the public administration both agreed that before the transformation the salaries were quite goodcxxx they have built their house just saving money from their wages one salary they used for living while the other they used to pay for the construction of their home every summer they went on holidays once they were in romania they felt like americans rich and powerful ohrid lake bulgarian black sea cost or the near by dojran were regular on their summer list of locations to spend their break in the late ’s they also bought a car the classical volkswagen everything was much better organized in socialist times according to the tomovski couple “astibo” had a kindergarten for our daughter we ate at the restaurant and those who had no living dwelling were given credits and so on their nostalgia for the good old times is confirmed by the difficult live they have today with expensive prices and low pensions even worse is the story of the former “makedonka” worker milancho manev who donated blood  times helping others in difficult times however this summer he could not find a single soul ready to help him pay his debt to the water supply public enterprisecxxxi to pay back the debt milancho had to do public work on the behalf of this enterprise he complains that these are the times when there is no job available similar situation happened to slobodan mishikj long time employee of the shtip printing house “ilinden” slobodan had to work in the public swimming pool all summer for a daily fee of  to  denars  to  euros and for the electric supply company in order to pay his debts for the electricity bill in shtip about hundred citizens worked this summer in public enterprises to pay back their bills the faith of the former goalkeeper of “fc bregalnica” stojan stojanov  is also disturbingcxxxii born in a village in a near to shtip region stojan’s parents left the rice field in kochani and came to work in “makedonka” stojan and his wife also worked in this company although he is more known as a football player both of them got laid off in  she after  years of experience and he with  they have three daughters one of them a student in bulgaria stojan’s spouse got a job in a private apparel producer her salary is what they live on according to him most of the laid of “makedonka” workers have a difficult life nowadays a number of workers from the liquidated soe’s in shtip have organized themselves in an informal association pressuring the government to help them find jobs stojan comments that life is very difficult “the state officials do not care if you have or not have money they take home appliances instead if we do not make now we shall undertake radical measures because our is not a life worth living”cxxxiii     the big winners of the transformation  logistics and transport     to export their final product to foreign markets apparel producers need a clearance from the custom authorities in order to get a custom clearance one needs a bank guarantee of  mkd about  euros certifying financial liability this is a job of shpedicja a custom clearance house sluzhba za carinsko deklariranje and there are  of them in shtip with  employed persons  only three apparel producers have own shpedicii albatros mavis and asteks the rest paying other shpedicii for the service the biggest  shpedicii in shtip are birkart canda fershped makoshped kamilshped montanashped bakshped visashped inteksshped and asteksshped besides these there are about  smaller shpedicii in this segment of the market in shtip birkard has a dominant position birkard works with  apparel companies in total  suppliers from shtip and  retailers based in west europe the biggest apparel companies from stip that birkart cooperates with are beas briteks elena labod eskada mont trejd vivendi and ve besides providing custom clearances the main activities of birkart are the transport of finished products work with cad and cam systems and final logistic and products preparing for the final clients working on the transport of finished goods birkard manages  vehicles that belong to other macedonian transport companies from stip mainly for the transporting activities birkart charges   provision many shtip apparel producers use the logistic services of birkart for the transport of their final products to western markets birkart combines orders from several apparel producers and transports their goods one truck can take between  light apparel or  light apparel and  heavy apparel items having no large depots to keep larger quantities of their products shtip apparel producers typically make small series of about  items for export which are immediately forwarded to retailers in europe on the way back to macedonia birkart transports various kinds of commercial products not necessarily related to the textiles and apparel industry each week about  trucks transport goods to western europe this equals a minimum of  pieces so that birkart alone is moving  million pieces if we take an average of  pieces per worker see remark up then about  workers would be needed to produce this the company also owns a customs depot carinski sklad of  m where it does custom clearance for the apparel producers in any case this company is very important trend setter because besides birkart there is only one other logistics center in shtip the canda international germany branch office textile logistic makedonija tlm it is worth mentioning that at the moment these are the only logistic centers in all macedonia birkard dominates the logistics in the macedonian clothing sector it works with  apparel companies in total  suppliers from shtip and  retailers based in west europe besides providing custom clearances the main activities of birkart are the transport of finished products work with cad and cam systems and final logistic and products preparing for the final clients working on the transport of finished goods birkart manages  vehicles that belong to other macedonian transport companies from stip mainly the company also owns a customs depot carinski sklad with around  sq meters to handle up to  pieces where it does custom clearance for the apparel producers  they provide services like labeling of clothes packaging sorting and they prepare all paper work for the final transport and export to european markets a close company to birkart is “new trend center for textile technology” founded in the beginning of the year as a joint venture between “zmaj promet” and ebiz “new trend” is a completely modernized european looking company the offices are fully equipped with modern computers and software to automatically adjust designs to different sizes trajan angelov is the manager of birkart and coowner of zmaj promet it is not difficult to confuse the three companies since the manager of “new trend” is suzanka angelova the wife of mr angelov at meetings and in interviews mrangelov often speaks in the name of “new trend” adding to the confusion since the three companies “birkart” “new trade” and “zmaj promet” are located in the same premises they could be seen as one larger enterprise before investing into textilegarment sector “ebiz” has conducted thorough analysis of the market realizing that there is an urgent need for investments in modern ict technologies in the summer of  “ebiz” called a tender for establishing the “new trend” and from the four participants “zmaj promet’s” offer seemed most attractive and economically viable the business plan for establishing the “new trend” was approved at the beginning of november of  the investment in “new trend” was  usd with “zmaj promet” investing  and “ebiz”  according to the business plan the “new trend” should became financially self sustainable in three years after which a redefinition of the ownership relations will occur “ebiz” does not intend to set up another center such as “new trend” stating that this single company is currently sufficient to cover the macedonian market and establishing another one would mean duplication and unnecessary dispersing of existing potential and knowledge new trend provides cad and cam services to interested macedonian apparel producers they began with promotion of the cam in may  and the shtip apparel producers are increasingly becoming to use the service the cad system is being used in two shifts whiles the cam in one shift currently the cam is used in  of its capacity hoping to reach  until the end of the year “new trend” has currently  customers  of them from stip the number of “new trend’s” customers is increasing every month the machines are both located on the ground floor of the main building companies in germany only have to send the design per email and the raw materials and “new trend” then prepares the clothing pieces for the companies using sophisticated software “new trend” provides quality control of the materials and trend” supplies clothing companies like milano for example with the accessory materials intended for cad and cam services importing them from italy they closely cooperate with the intermediary company global from skopje for new trendbirkart it would be great if there are more companies moving to fullpackaging using their global networks the company’s future priorities are to attract more clients because there is luck of confidence in this kind of business and to become the major raw material suppliers textile logistics macedoniacanda was actually the first logistic center in macedonia it was founded by textile logistic bulgaria tlb in march  and today it works with about twenty apparel producers from macedonia from kochani kavadarci bitola and skopje and five from shtip lars mavis metropremier beas and labod mk elena a dozen other companies have signaled already their additional interest in cooperation tlm works for canda which is subcontracted by the multinational chain ca in its operations tlm is de facto autonomous in relation to the tlb still while more than  of technical and logistic operations of tlm is coordinated directly through germany canda alike birkart tlm also works with cad and cam systems and final logistic and product preparing for the final clients for transportation tlm uses mainly the services of the german company meyer  meyer and their associates grdovjanka tlm is a significant customer of birkart’s depot            tlm rents a store belonging to angroteks which used to be a furniture department store in  tlm subcontracted companies produced for canda germany    pieces of clothing    pieces in  with the expected growth in produced items of   for  including products from  new companies producing heavy clothing for transportation tlm uses mainly the services of meyer  meyer grdovjanka and their associates the average annual number of trucks driving tlm goods is around  while in high season there are  trucks monthly the average number of clothing units per truck is  in the interview mr georgiev explained that birkart is somehow copying the tlm logistic model he does not consider birkart to be a dangerous competitor and he thinks they can complete each other mr georgiev said that tlm is practically the only significant customer of birkart’s depot and almost  of goods stored there belong to tlm he is satisfied with tlm’s position on the macedonian market with the relations with canda and indirectly ca being the biggest asset and advantage over macedonian rivals finally we should also mention the transport sector there about  people employed in the transport forwarding sector in shtip the two largest companies in the market gradovjanka and zmaj promet are related to the logistic centers birkart and tlm the prices are dominated by the offers of birkart and tlm  “zmaj promet” works since  and does international transport of goods with  workers and  trucks about   of the time they drive apparel from all over macedonia to germany benelux greece and their business is going on wellcxxxiv  the transport company “gradovjanka” was founded in  and in  become a branchoffice of the german transport company mayer  mayer for the macedonian region concentrating on forwarding apparel “gradovjanka” is not the only company that provides transport services for the mayer  mayer as currently there are also  other companies doing this at the moment they have  trucks and cooperate with the following apparel producers from shtip lars vabo eskada shtipteks canda the total number of employees is  together with drivers and they have eight trucks mostly they are transporting in germany belgian and holland  their business premises are in the former enterprise staklara  noemvri from skopje which they bought  years ago currently the company has storage area of   m of noncovered land which it plans to enlarge it is important to know that there is no real maintenance or service for trucks in macedonia in the republic it is only possible to do repairs but spare parts are not accessible at all for major repairs macedonian companies send their trucks into the eu – to greece according to liljana puncheva chief of customs in shtip shef na carinska ispostava besides birkard  trucks and mayer  mayer  trucks the other most active transport companies are metro premier with  trucks divna with  trucks and dm preciz with  trucks she mentioned that the average number of trucks that export goods each month through the shtip customs is  the busiest days being friday and saturdaycxxxv on average five apparel producers use one truck to export goods many exporters from skopje also use terminal in shtip and many have their offices there including the intermediary company global from skopje there are  forwarding companies in the custom direction buildingcxxxvi while  are located elsewherecxxxvii    the role of the intermediaries    the sale intermediaries or agents had a very important role in the textile and clothing industry in the sfr yugoslav period at that time in macedonia there were two intermediary companies inteks and makoteks dealing with export of finished products and import of raw materials and fabrics inteks was a trade representative of a large conglomerate of  factoriesproducers from macedonia “makedonka” and “astibo” were members of intekscxxxviii in fact the government of socialist macedonia urged the smaller apparel producers to join “inteks”cxxxix inteks organized representations of the macedonian textile and clothing producers at international fairs and provided its members information about new machines and technologies  within inteks there was a part which follows fashionable trends machines and went regularly to fashion fairs in moscow leipzig düsseldorf belgrade zagreb and ljubljana where they had a stand together with other producers from sfry  in the ’s “inteks” had  of the total turnover and  of the profits of the textile and apparel producers in the republic and made exports worth  million usd in the western markets and  in the socialist blockcxl in  it had  employees with export for the first half of  worth  million usd in   of which sold in the western marketscxli in the same year “inteks” had problems getting payments from companies from the socialist block of countries especially from those from the soviet union and the german democratic republiccxlii in  there were about  employed in the inteks consortium with   export productioncxliii they used to import  tons of cotton not only for the  producers from macedonia but for all sfr yugoslavia in the beginning there were  employed in inteks then  today  the company has lost its intermediary position and the owner zoran azmanov lives of renting the real estate of the company former managers of inteks have however continued doing the business of intermediation between western buyers and macedonian manufacturers the two directors and partners of texico a leading sales intermediary mr grukevski and mr vaskov are an example texico exists since november  and employs six persons it works with  foreign partners mainly from germany but also from italy and belgium texico is intermediary in the annual sale of one million pieces of apparel their way of business is to negotiate deals with the foreign buyers together with the local producers texico’s profit margin is five percent the annual turnover of texico is around two million euros while lavishbelt int polaris and etra have about the same annual turnover as texico the biggest company in this business nowadays is global with an annual turnover of about eur  million global’s  of its customers are from the eu particularly from germany netherlands italy and england and  are from the usa they are gradually abandoning the us market and focus more on european markets due to the possibilities for achieving lower transport costs and greater flexibility in production global has partner cooperation with the well established german clothing company steilmann group the owner mrvladimir ichokaev has built a logistical centre in skopje with a customs depot and cad and cam machines and plans to invest in a laboratory for washing clothes apart from

andrija štampar  years ago in  in a village of drenovac croatia dr andrija štampar was born his work in the first half of the last century he died in  marked the milestones and ways of modern social medicine and public health between two world wars štampar started organizing and materializing his grandiose revolutionary hygienicepidemiological and preventiveprophylacticcurative programme he paid the greatest attention to the control of serious social diseases and to tuberculosis malaria endemic syphilis typhus and trachoma in particular in  with the financial support of the rockefeller foundation he founded the school of public health with a task to study conditions which might have favourable or unfavourable impacts on peoples health during that period he visited many countries in europe china three times india the ussr and others in  he obtained the post of an expert at the health organization in geneva at the invitation from the rockefeller foundation in  he delivered the cutter lecture in boston after boston he toured a great part of north america and lectured on hygiene and social medicine at a series of universities yale cornell johns hopkins cincinnati vanderbilt mcharry tulane texas los angeles berkley much of dr štampars life energy and mental capacity was devoted not only to the establishment of a school of public health in his own country but also to the creation and shaping of the world health organization who he was called “the father of who” in copenhagen geneva manila in any place where who was active he contributed to developing the statute of who and through the letters of this international document he spread progressive ideas and fought against colonialism racism and for the equality of all nations and all people the international health conference held in new york in  attended by official representatives of  nations established an interim commission of  states and dr štampar was elected its chairman the interim commission was in fact the world health organization but did not bear this name untill its ratification by the united nations this commission under dr štampars guidance carried out an extremely important task of establishing collaboration in health issues and helping the economically weaker countries dr štampar was elected the president of the first world health assembly in  in his later years dr štampar again travelled to distant countries in  he was in afghanistan where at the request of who he gave advice about the reorganization of the medical school in that country the following year he visited egypt and sudan as the leader of a seminar for public health administrators in  he went to ethiopia to see the conditions under which the medical school could be established there then he went to sudan again to study the problem of health services in  professor štampar was awarded the leon bernard foundation prize and medal the greatest international recognition of merit in the field of social medicine this year when we celebrate the th štampar anniversary this book is devoted to memory of his work vi preface this is the fifth book planed to be published in a series as a support to teachers and trainers in teaching public health in south eastern europe originally planned to be on the internet platform only the public health in south eastern europe phsee forum for public health in the eastern europe fphsee and the metanet projects decided later to publish this training material also in hard copy form the first four books were published with the support of the phsee and the last two with metanet project both projects are funded by the german academic exchange services daad with funds from the stability pact for south eastern europe the book management in health care practice is collection of  teaching modules written by  authors from  countries the teaching modules in this book covered areas of principles of public health management cycle planning implementation and evaluation technology and interventions organization of health care and health services change leadership and some other fields of health care authors had full autonomy in preparation the teaching modules they were asked to present their own teachingtraining materials with the idea to be as practical and lively as possible having that in mind the reader and the user of the modules of this book can sometimes find that some areas of management and organization of health services are not covered some are just tackled and some are more deeply elaborated the role of editors was more to stimulate the authors to write modules than to conduct or edit the content preparing and publishing this teachingtraining modules authors and editors expect and wish to support and improve public health education and training of public health professionals the editors asked and stimulate authors to incorporate in their teaching modules exercises tests questionnaires and other practical forms of training we will be thankful for any comments on use of them in everyday practice editors and project coordinators doris bardehle luka kovačić ulrich laaser oliver razum and lijana zaletelkragelj

after completing this module students and public health professionals should • be aware of importance of relation between development and health • recognize needs for doing analysis of health inequalities in the country • know the areas of health related to development • improve the knowledge and understanding of the function of the health care system better health leads to faster economic growth which in turn leads to healthier populations historical studies have shown that a substantial proportion of todays economic wealth can be attributed directly to past achievements in the health sphere health contributes to human capital through higher productivity securing labour supply through skills and the savings that become available for investment in physical and intellectual capital poor health negatively influences labour market productivity as measured by earnings and wages at the same time life expectancy increases with income across countries but at a rate that becomes progressively lower as income increases due to diminishing health returns to income however the relationship between wealth and health is not as straightforward as was previously thought rather it

of individual work and assessment of the contribution to the group discussions  health and development luka vončina luka kovačić theoretical background although health is primarily described as an intrinsic good it also has qualities of an investment good one could hardly disagree with the notion that better health leads to faster economic growth which in turn catalyzed by the equitable distribution of wealth leads to healthier populations in other words richer and more equitable countries will have healthier populations which will in turn nourish their development a quote from the world bank’s  world development report clearly summarizes the point “broad improvements in human welfare will not occur unless poor people receive wider access to affordable better quality services in health education water sanitation and electricity without such improvements in services freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy  two of the most important ways poor people can escape poverty  will remain elusive to many”  table monetary value of life expectancy gains in selected cceecis countries    source marck suhrcke regina sauto arce martin mckee and lorenzo rocco the economic costs of ill health in the european region background document for the who european  ministerial conference on health systems “health systems health and wealth” tallin estonia june  the evidence that human capital contributes to economic growth and development is abundant health contributes to human capital through higher productivity securing labour supply through skills and the savings that become available for investment in physical and intellectual capital  at the microeconomic level poor health negatively influences labour market productivity as measured by earnings and wages  evidence from the eu suggests that people reporting “very good” or “good” health have earnings as much as four times higher than those with “poor” or “very poor” health  the evidence that ill health reduces labour supply is also ample  at the macroeconomic level historical studies have shown that a substantial proportion of today’s economic wealth can be attributed directly to past achievements in the health sphere it has been estimated for example that about  of the economic growth experienced by the united kingdom between  and  can be attributed to improved health and nutrition  many studies have shown that health helps to explain economic growth differences between poor and rich countries these findings can be used to predict future trajectories of per capita income on the basis of a country’s reduction in mortality the outcome of such an exercise in five low and middle income countries in cee and the cis showed that even relatively modest scenarios bring substantial increases in gdp when compared with the base scenario of no change an annual reduction in mortality of just  would increase gdp by  in kazakhstan and the russian federation and by  in georgia and romania over  years  the relationship between income inequality and mortality as backlund and al stated in a study in the united states is only robust to adjustment for compositional factors in men and women under  this explains why income inequality is not a major driver of mortality trends in the united states because most deaths occur at ages  and over this analysis does suggest however the certain causes of death that occur primarily in the population under  may be associated with income inequality comparison of analytical techniques also suggests coefficients for income inequality in previous multilevel mortality studies may be biased  case study while it is common knowledge that within countries rich people are more likely to be healthy than poor people are people in rich countries necessarily healthier than the ones in poor countries the concept of health inequalities both within countries and among different countries is a particularly interesting one as it has the potential to provide insight into different factors that can influence health as such it has attracted a lot of attention for example it has been found that within countries levels of income individuals earn seem to play a significant role according to abelsmith “the unskilled manual group in the united kingdom has twice the rate of limiting long standing illness compared with the professional group”  others on the other hand argue that factors such as social position relative as opposed to absolute deprivation in wealth control and social participation also seem to matter   before engaging into discussion about health and wealth a few remarks should be made about the indicators used to describe both who’s  definition of health defines it as “a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” as abel smith lucidly points out the definition “expresses high rhetorical ideals but gives no indication of how health can be measured”  furthermore as the concept of health is a multidimensional one baxter lists five dimensions disease disability frequency of illness malaise and fitness  it is hard to imagine a measure that would embrace them all and accurately measure health in practice statistics of morbidity and mortality are commonly used to measure ill health and give indications about health in general unfortunately apart from methodological problems the task of measuring health suffers also from practical ones the quality of data collected varies widely across countries and regions in the who published edition “measuring socioeconomic inequalities in health” kunst and mackenbach conclude that “data problems are common and can easily lead to incorrect conclusion” therefore data should be observed and countries should be compared with caution  the link between levels of wealth and health of different countries is often regarded as a crucial one in  preston showed that life expectancy increases with income across countries but at a rate that becomes progressively lower as income increases due to diminishing health returns to income  pritchett and summers claim that country differences in income growth rates over the last three decades explain roughly  percent of the cross country differences in mortality improvements they estimate that if income were one percent higher in the developing countries as many as  infant and  child deaths would be averted annually  samuel preston’s millennium curve  seems to follow the same pattern of thought the curve is a nonparametrically fitted regression function weighted by population the slope of lifeexpectancy with respect to income described by deaton is steep in the group of poorest countries suggesting that at low incomes income itself could be strongly related to health  however in the same article plotting changes in life expectancy from  to  against the corresponding average annual rate of growth of gdp in real ppp dollars deaton finds that “the connection between income and lifeexpectancy at low incomes may be plausible but even among the initially poorest countries differences in income growth explain less than a sixth of the variance in improvements in life expectancy and even an increase in the year growth rate by  percent a year would add only  year to lifeexpectancy” this finding clearly suggests that the relationship between wealth and health is not as straightforward as was previously thought rather it seems to be a more complex and multidimensional one and factors other than wealth may exist that also influence health of populations the same conclusion could be drawn from the facts the health indicators of populations vary between countries that have similar gdps and that some countries have similar health indicators at very different amounts of gdps furthermore some poorer countries seem to have healthier populations than some richer ones for example according to who data in  cuba had a life expectancy at birth of  years and a gdp per capita of usd  while the united states of america with an almost thirteen times higher gdp per capita of usd  had exactly the same  life expectancy china is another good example although in the year  it had a gdp of only usd  it had a life expectancy at birth total population of  years  figure  millennium preston curve note circles have diameter proportional to population size source angus deaton health in an age of globalization research program in development studies centre for health and wellbeing princeton university prepared for the brookings trade forum brookings institution washington dc may th th  in the s the rockefeller foundation selected five countries china costa rica cuba kerala and sri lanka that appeared to have higher expectation of life than could have been expected from their level of wealth and commissioned studies of their health development to determine possible causes to these discrepancies common factors found in all of them were above average equality of income well developed primary education that covered females a heavy emphasis on nutrition land reforms priority given to health and community participation and well developed rural health care halstead et al   the importance of the findings the study discovered and their applicability to policymaking have since then attracted a lot of attention and stimulated a lot of research in the recent years it has become widely acknowledged that inequalities in the distribution of income play a highly significant role in determining health of entire populations although some authors do not completely agree with this conclusion see for example mellor and milyo   most of the literature on the subject approves it le grand argues that across countries an association can be found between inequalities in health and inequalities in income  wilkinson claims that the extent of income inequality in societies determines their average health status he argues that as the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor increases the health  status of citizens becomes worse and worse and that it undermines social cohesion  according to kennedy et al inequalities in income at the state level exert an independent effect on an individuals risk of reporting fair or poor health  the relationship between economic growth income inequalities and health status is an even more interesting one according to dreze and sen economic growth per se does not automatically improve health and social well being they claim that unless it is effectively distributed it merely increases socioeconomic differences  generally two major interpretations exist about the exact way in which income inequalities affect health they do not necessarily negate each other but rather observe the problem from different angles the first interpretation advocates the importance of psychosocial process based on perceptions of place in the social hierarchy  the advocates of this interpretation argue that such perceptions produce negative emotions like shame and distrust that affect health directly by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms and indirectly through inducing behaviours like alcohol consumption and smoking the second interpretation know as the neomaterial interpretation sees income inequalities in a wider picture of historical cultural economic and political processes it argues that these processes influence the general availability of food education health services quality housing and other segments of infrastructure that influence health  therefore it sees income inequalities as a symptom of a wider array of social conditions and suggests that an unequal distribution of all of them influences health negatively on the deprived a closer look at the findings of the rockefeller study also reveals that all of the “poor countries with good health” it examined gave high priority to education female education seems to be a particularly powerful tool for improving health the world bank’s world development report  issues in health reveals that studies from  developing countries showed that even as little as one to three years of female education seem to be able to reduce child mortality by about  percent similar levels of male schooling showed to have a more limited effect reducing child mortality by  percent the effects of female education on good health are heterogeneous on the one hand it is known that female education reduces fertility and that reduced fertility has a positive effect on infant mortality it seems plausible that educated women take better care of themselves during pregnancy pay more attention to hygiene appreciate maternal health services better than the uneducated and thus act more positive to health in general the impacts of malnutrition sanitation and other hygienic measures on health are historically well known in the reduction of deaths from infectious diseases in england before  these factors played a much more important role than immunization and health services  the world bank’s  world development report claims that risks such as poor sanitation insufficient and unsafe water supplies poor personal and food hygiene inadequate garbage disposal indoor air pollution and crowded and inferior housing account for nearly   of the global burden of disease  according to halstead most of the countries observed in the rockefeller foundation funded studies developed programs that laid a heavy emphasis on food policies water supplies and sanitation  the text has so far dealt with the health effects of wealth wealth distribution education nutrition sanitation etc but what is about healthcare if all the above mentioned factors seem to play such important roles in determining health statuses of populations how big of an effect can  it have according to the world bank’s world development report   the developing countries as a group could reduce their burden of disease by  if they redirected a half of the funds they are currently spending on services of low cost effectiveness to public health programs primary healthcare delivered to the needy besides not being expensive seams to be especially important and effective according to gwatkin et al a “well designed and carefully implanted interventions can reduce infant and child mortality by as much as one half within five years at a cost below two percent of per capita income”  arguments presented in this text strongly suggest policy guidelines primarily for developing but also for developed countries it could be argued that all of the above mentioned determinants of good health seem to be interdependent and that they seem to be a part of a bigger picture it would appear that countries more orientated towards social justice equity equality and social welfare rather than to the accumulation of power and capital in the hands of a minority could expect their populations to be healthier social and political structures of societies could thus significantly influence health of populations most important determinants of good health would be sustained firstly through political commitment to social justice equity and equality which would than manifest themselves by social commitment to welfare universal healthcare a strong emphasis on education and the will to ensure everybody decent living conditions or in other words in a commitment to wellbeing for the whole population exericise task  analysis of link between gdp and health in the region course participants should be divided into groups of  group should first come to

background the system system can be defined as a set of interrelated elements organized to achieve a common purpose in the environment in which the system exists the elements should function as a functional whole interrelated elements and common purpose are the key words of the quoted definition every element can be regarded as a subsystem and on the other side the system makes a subsystem of a larger system this structure is known as hierarchical structure the term system is very much used in everyday language and because of that it may have many connotations and different meanings the most frequent understanding is that it means an organized hierarchical administrative structure the term health system is often used instead of the terms health administration or health services health administration will sometimes be described as a “nonsystem” or “there is no system” to stress that it is not well organized theoretically this is not quite correct because it actually means that a system operates which does not meet our expectations or we do not understand it another example of misunderstanding is to combine elements without any interrelation or interdependency of components of the system it is not correct because in the system a change in one element is bound to affect other parts and the functioning of the whole the health care system is one of the subsystems of the broader social system systems analysis in order to know how the system or subsystems work the process of analysis known as systems analysis could be applied the term systems analysis has many different meanings in general it could be defined as a formal inquiry carried out to help someone referred to as the decision maker to identify a better course of action and make a better decision than he might otherwise have made the characteristic attributes of a problem situation where systems analysis is called upon are complexity of the issue and uncertainty of the outcome of any course of action that might reasonably be taken systems analysis usually has some combination of the following identification and reidentification of objectives constraints and alternative courses of action examination of the probable consequences of the alternatives in terms of costs benefits and risks presentation of the results in a comparative framework so that the decision maker can make an informed choice from among the alternatives the typical use of systems analysis is to guide decisions on issues such as national or corporate plans and programs resource use and protection policies  research and development in technology regional and urban development educational systems health and other social services the nature of these problems requires an interdisciplinary approach there are several specific kinds or focuses of systems analysis for which different terms are used a systems analysis related to public decisions is often referred to as a policy analysis in the united states the terms are used interchangeably a systems analysis that concentrates on comparison and ranking of alternatives on basis of their known characteristics is referred to as decision analysis  system analysis is based on the notion of the systems all situations in real life can lead us to the description of a system it can be a social system an administrative system a biological system or any other kind one can describe the health services as a system there are different systems in our body and there are railway systems and systems of thoughts a systematic examination of a system situation problem should be done in steps in which each step is made as explicit as possible the steps are − listing all elements which can be related to the system or its environment − defining goals and objectives of the system identifying also their hierarchy and the most important objective in an observed situation according to the purpose of the analysis − choosing elements which will be considered as the proper system bounding or bordering the system and others which will be regarded as environment according to defined goals and objectives − describing and examining elements and their relations − generating optional solutions alternatives by manipulating elements and relations to fit better the objectives of the system or to find solutions for identified problems − comparing and evaluating different alternatives and modelling a complex new system the question is how to choose elements which are relevant for the system the solution is to start from the common purpose the element contributing directly to the purpose will be regarded as the element of the proper system and all others as elements of the environment in which the system exists in that way different elements might make our proper health system when we consider the financial situation of health services and different elements when we consider health status the important point is that in both situations all elements will be initially considered and some of them deliberately chosen as elements of the proper system of our concern there are several advantages in using system analysis first it stimulates us to list all relevant factors which might be involved this is very important because it helps us to overcome a common mistake and to consider only few closest elements along with our usual thinking for instance very often when we examine the health services the users are forgotten the most important element of the system organizational structure resources manpower equipment and facilities are examined but not people who will use it second system analysis is forcing us to proceed systematically starting from specified objectives every step is performed deliberately and when shortcuts are used we are aware of them  third system analysis stimulates us to think about different new approaches and alternatives even out of usual ways of thinking it is made easier because some elements which are considered “untouchable” in real life are also taken into account during “theoretical” consideration for instance new ways in mobilizing resources new patterns of supervision and reporting etc might come into the picture organization organization as a process is the arrangement of parts which form an effective whole the term is also used to describe a structure a group of people with a special purpose eg a unit of health services an institution the organization may be regarded as an open dynamic sociotechnical system it is a dialectical relation of a given technology and social aspects of its application ie work connected with that technology division of labour relations toward means of production interpersonal and group relations because of that the organization of health units with different types of technology has different work relations and different organizational problems for instance a big hospital in comparison with a health centre the organization may also be regarded as having different characteristics as the consequence of size level of complexity and phase of development macroorganization will deals with big overall systems and microorganization with small units eg a rural hospital or a district health centre in everyday life expressions such as “young organization” “traditional organization” “handicapped organization” etc are used and they indicate the lively social dynamics of organizations because organization is a complex sociotechnical system it may be understood from different points of view − as a functional system in which the main importance is given to technology and the purpose of organization is to perform in the best way ie in accordance with technological requirements and giving the maximal output of an acceptable quality − as a rational system in which a rational order is of the main importance ie neat division of tasks clear responsibilities hierarchical decisionmaking disciplined subordination − as a group of people in which the psychological relations individual behaviour and group dynamics play the essential role − as a social system in which the main influence have interests of individuals and groups the power structure and permanent dynamic tension regarding domination and authority to decide about utilization of resources personal and group benefits the described concepts reflect the relative importance given to different aspects of the same process consequently they will also influence the style of how organizational problems are solved organizing implies the ability to coordinate activities necessary for implementation in such a way that the right things are done in the right place at the right time in the right way and by the right people to reach that a manager has to observe − objectives  − definition of tasks for each group and every individual − clear line of authority command responsibility health care system the health care system is a whole of political economic and cultural technical and organizational factors relations processes and elements in which individuals groups and communities interrelate having the goal to satisfy their health needs health and health care can be well understood only in the broadest context of human life that includes social economic and political issues besides understanding of biological facts it also requires the understanding of environmental historical and cultural circumstances these various aspects can be observed differently according to given situation and purpose of study the depth of understanding will be influenced by our own experience knowledge and ideology because of that an active effort will be needed to observe listen and compare sometimes with patience and prudent tolerance without active involvement honesty and openness the reward will be minor or meaningless health system economics education and culture environment health social and biological component s health care including health services socio – political conditions frame figure  relations of the health care system and other systems  the health care system is the subsystem of social organization system and it has various subsystems − sociopolitical subsystem  the main health legislation is as a rule at the national level but communities could be more or less selfreliant and responsible for planning and organization of health care solidarity and support is usually at higher levels − subsystem of users communities and individuals  responsibility and participation of the community in planning organization operation and control − socioeconomic subsystem  health insurance obligatory voluntary private and private relation of health providers and users − managerial subsystem decision making process level of autonomy of health institutions type of management autocratic birocratic corporative laizessfair − technological subsystem  comprehensive approach in provision of primary health care segmented at secondary level − organizational subsystem – levels of the health infrastructure primary secondary tertiary type of health institutions individual practices group practices health centres day hospitals clinical hospitals − health care infrastructure health care facilities  infrastructure could be a subsystem which supports the operations of an organization health centre health subcentre hospital medical centre institute of public health rehabilitation centre and spas pharmacy specialized institutes  vaccine production emergency services in large cities blood supply etc private practice  dentists physicians nurses herbalists and other alternative practitioners − supporting systems  training and research institutes health related industries production of drugs equipment etc levels of the health care system all models of health care systems are imperfect and there is no a model which is the best and broadly accepted and recommended there are big differences among countries influenced by history tradition sociocultural economic and political and other factors but regardless of all present differences there are some common characteristics typical for the organized health care system  one of common characteristics of organization of health care is a level of organization health care systems are usually organized on three levels primary secondary and tertiary the main characteristics of each level are presented in table  on primary level we can recognize several sublevels with their characteristics − primary community home level with  or more members primary community or group is one in which people are in permanent relations have regular contacts and know each other well discussions and decisions are within the group itself and through direct personal communication this type of communities is for example families some neighbourhoods small villages workers in smaller workers units members of some societies etc these groups are often practicing selfhelp and mutual aid traditional forms of health care volunteer promoters have sometimes an important role  − local community level  members local communities are groups usually living in the same setting or otherwise sharing facilities or other resources or interests this community is often formally recognized and some temporary social structures may exist with guiding and facilitating communication the members know each other but they do not live so close to have regular personal contacts the decisions are often made at public meetings or in other organized ways besides there are informal structures sharing information and exercising some power the local communities are of a medium size which is limited by efficiency in running different common social services like churches shops schools etc at this level the first recognized and established health worker may be found heshe works at least partly on a professional basis the first health facility is also established dispensary health posts health stations and similar a midwife nurse health technician or a general practitioner may be the typical health worker in more developed areas health teams operate usually integrated preventive and curative service is provided including simple common treatment table  characteristics of levels of health care population type of community primary    secondary   family neighbourhood municipality school firm district larger city tertiary  or more region country desired level of integration very high or high selective specialized highly selective subspecialized type of providers health individual practice group practice health centre pharmacy municipal hospital county hospital special hospital policlinic public health institute regional clinical hospital national public health institute − intermediate municipal level population of  people the municipality commune or other similar social structure usually needs to function also as the basic administrative unit often the first official administrative needs are fulfilled and an office exists which operates permanently very often the decision making is formally prescribed and implemented according to certain rules and laws at this level the offices may exist in which different governmental and local regulations are issued data collected and other administration fulfilled the established health unit is staffed with a team having often some epidemiological duties eg surveillance and also guiding and coordinating work of health workers in the local communities  the unit is often called the health centre a medical assistant a nurse or a general medical practitioner might be in charge − on the secondary level the district or region in some countries with population of about  or more people is a larger administrative centre being also often a centre of trades manufacture and more developed cultural and social institutions a representative of the government in his office performs different governmental duties services start to be specialized and local representatives of different central programs might be permanently present it is often a small or larger hospital depend on the population size andor a larger health centre comprising also beds for maternity and shortterm observation and treatment besides gps there might be several main medical specialists the first referral services are provided the guidance management and supervision of health services is expected and in training of health workers etc − the tertiary level is regional or national level population of more than half of million is usually regional or national administrative centre with regional or national authorities and legislation clinical hospitals or clinical centres located on that level have referral function for the health services located on lower levels educational and research functions these health institutions are usually responsible for development of national guidelines and standards national institutes of public health are responsible for monitoring of national health international communications and high specialized public health services laboratories blood supply etc exercises task  setup the boundaries of an emergency health care system in a district of  inhabitants there are many ways to present a health care system many different elements may be chosen as essential for the system depending on problems we are dealing with and objectives of the exercise a permanent thinking “forwardbackward” is going on during designing a system what are the objectives which elements can help in satisfying them all the time analytical and syntactical skills are involved the exercise cannot be solved mechanically creativity is playing an important role supported by imagination it is difficult to decide how many details are needed and what can be regarded as a subsystem during designing the system you are already stating your hypotheses and greatly determining the final conclusions your task is  make individually a list of all relevant elements you think that they are in the system of emergency health care in a district of  inhabitants you could make also a list of elements outside the emergency health care what can contribute to that system  draw a diagram presenting elements in and out the emergency health care system and connect the elements with the lines  comment and explain your findings in a small group  task  levels inside primary health care as it was described earlier in this module it is possible to identify three sublevels of social structures to which correspond levels of health care there are however variations in size and relative importance of individual levels as well as in health manpower and between rural and urban settings it is important to identify these differences explain them and discover if they influence outcomes of primary health services the students’ task is to  describe a situation in your district or country name size services and health manpower in different sublevels inside primary health care in urban and rural settings  compare your findings with those of other participants in your group and identify differences discuss the reasons and consequences  report to the plenary and consider advantages and disadvantages of different solutions in consideration of different solutions for the organization of services on the grassroot level of primary health care the following factors have to be taken into account • the interface between population and services • the interrelation between levels communication and span of control • differences between the rural and urban settings and explanations of that • practical problems in functioning of different levels expected outcomes list of comments and experiences gained during discussions each student should explain what changes are necessary in hisher circumstances what type of changes students expect in hisher situation during

and the strategies that were taken or are actual in the present to help people to preserve their health • be familiar with project management approach in conduction of health promotion projects in european society very important changes have occurred in recent decades they brought different health problems different interventions were developed in order to preserve health in the society health promotion has proved to be one of the most important tools in this field implementation of health promotion is not possible without radical changes in approach to and method of work as this is the case of intervention in several social subsystems the project method is considered the most adequate tool for implementation of health promotion in organisations institutes of public health have due to their role in the society of today developed various kind of knowledge and skills to facilitate the implementation of project work they are closely connected with several social subsystems so they stand a real chance of undertaking the role of project coordinators in health promotion the benefits gained by the institutes of public health through taking part in health promotion projects will not only be those reflected in broader social community and other organisations the new working methods will above all find their most rapid and positive expression in the very same institutes ie in the

lijana zaletel kragelj theoretical bacground some useful definitions and considerations for understanding the module public health when speaking of “public health” to many people even medical professionals this term conjures up images of hospitals and ill people and has the same meaning as publicly funded health systems however public health is actually quite different from that  it has at its heart the aim of improving wellbeing promoting positive health and preventing diseases thus the main focus of public health is health and disease prevention this is reached through its activities it prevents epidemics and the spread of disease protects against environmental hazards prevents injuries promotes and encourages healthy behaviours responds to natural and societal disasters and assists communities in recovery and assures the quality and accessibility of health services according to this public health has many subfields most typically is divided into following subfields or categories • epidemiology of communicable diseases • environmental health hygiene • social and behavioural health social medicine and • health statistics the role of public health is of major importance for the health of the population since many diseases are preventable through simple nonmedical methods public health plays its role in prevention efforts through local health systems or through international nongovernmental organizations public health services when we know what “public health” is we can start discussion about public health services there exist several definitions of “public health services” among them being also the definition of organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd  according to oecd prevention and public health services comprise services designed to enhance the health status of the population as distinct from the curative services which repair health dysfunction typical services are vaccination campaigns and programmes but prevention and public health functions included in this definition do not cover all fields of public health in the broadest sense of a crossfunctional common concern for health matters in all political and public actions some of these broadly defined public health functions such as emergency plans and environmental protection are not part of expenditure on health   since the main focus of public health is health and disease prevention this is the main focus of public health services as well activities performed by public health services are socalled public health interventions the focus of a public health intervention is among others to prevent a disease through surveillance systems of cases of various diseases eg communicable diseases surveillance system and the promotion of healthy life style but in addition to these activities in many cases treating of a disease can be vital to preventing it in others such as during an outbreak of an infectious disease vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of activities of public health services essential tasks of public health services essential tasks of public health services are to • monitor health status to identify community health problems • diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community • inform educate and empower people about health issues • mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems • develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts • enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety • link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable • assure a competent public health and personal health care workforce • evaluate effectiveness accessibility and quality of personal and populationbased health services and • research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems level of functioning of public health services the population covered by a single public health service can be as small as a group of people a family or local community for instance or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents for instance in the case of a pandemic thus the level of functioning of a public health service can be • local • regional • national • international or • global on the national level countries have their own government public health agencies to respond to domestic health issues on the top being ministries of health and national institutes of public health we can present some very well known national agencies which are not involved only with national duties but also with several international health activities • maybe the most known public health system is the system of the united states of america us in the us the agency responsible for the public health of the  us population is us public health service usphs led by the surgeon general of the united states the usphs administers a number of critically important health agencies including the food and drug administration fda the centres for disease control cdc with its headquarters in atlanta and the national institutes of health nih the cdc is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting public health activities in the united states cdc’s focus is to protect the health of all us people cdc keeps humanity at the forefront of its mission to ensure health protection through promotion prevention and preparedness  it is composed of several units being national institute for occupational safety and health and six coordinating centresoffices including environmental health and injury prevention health information services health promotion infectious diseases global health and terrorism preparedness and emergency response • an example of a national public health agencyinstitution is finnish national public health institute ktl  ktl is responsible as an expert body under the finnish ministry of social affairs and health for providing various professionals and citizens the best available public health information for their choices this institution could be classified among the most important public health services in europe its ideas have been spread even worldwide an example is an intervention programme for combating noncommunicable diseases known under its acronym cindi countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention  on the international and global level there exist several very well known public health organizationsagencies • in the first place it is an organization which acts on the international and global level and which is in fact a guiding body for public health services at national regional and local levels – the world health organization who  who is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters shaping the health research agenda setting norms and standards articulating evidencebased policy options providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends  • here again we have to mention cdc with its international activities • but not only us also european union eu established an agency similar to cdc  the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc  which was established in  it is an eu agency with aim to strengthen europes defences against infectious diseases it is seated in stockholm sweden ecdcs mission is to identify assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases the ecdc disease specific activities are organised within seven horizontal programmes with team members from all technical units programme on influenza programme on tuberculosis programme on food and waterborne diseases programme on other diseases of environmental and zoonotic origin programme on vaccine preventable diseases and invasive bacterial infections programme on hiv sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne viruses  and programme on antimicrobial resistance and healthcareassociated infections  but not only national international or global level is important regional and local levels are of principal importance since they are gatekeepers for diseases which could spread over the borders of a country this importance and an example of organizational scheme will be presented via case study from slovenia there is no average scheme how to organize public health services since every country has its own scheme of public health services organization which depends on its health care system organization before introducing the case study it is necessary to discuss some contemporary public health issues and the present and the future role of public health services in solving contemporary public health problems some contemporary public health issues in europe to challenge public health services very important changes in society have occurred in europe in recent decades a falling birthrate has resulted in small families where both parents work and many children are cared for outside their home for most of the day the divorcerate is high urbanization is increasing and more and more people live in satellite towns with long travel times to their work further problems stem from the increasing proportion of older people in the population the changing disease and health care demand patterns with increasing emphasis on the care of chronic diseases are reflected both in morbidity and mortality statistics the balance between primary care and hospital care is everywhere under review with increasing stress on the importance on the longterm care and a welldeveloped primary care system reliable researches and statistical information is important for monitoring these changes as the need for planning and priority –making in public health grows the financial implications of the operations of health organizations are enormous painstaking planning prior evaluation and a detailed subsequent research are increasingly necessary all recent experiences show how difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory balance between completing priorities in health care between the demands of effectiveness and equity and between completing attitudes of different health professions responses to contemporary pressure demographic trends crude live births in most of europe are about  per  population per year almost equal to mortality rates as a consequence the total populationsize is essentially stable only a few countries have recorded a slight natural increase many other report an overall decline of the population the population of europe is however aging the proportion of children in the agegroup  decreasing and the highage groups are growing these demographic changes have important consequences for public health policy and planning low fertility will undoubtedly continue and the number of families with few children will further increase the  number of large families will continue to be low but they will tend to present health services with social economic and health problems the modernization of family planning and the spread of more efficacious and less hazardous methods have contributed to a decrease in the number of unplanned pregnancies the use of more dangerous methods such as abortions is being discouraged but it is still quite high in a number of european countries the youth group is declining in size but the problems facing young people are important for social and health policy accidents drug abuse smoking unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease are very important in youth groups as are the psychological and social effects of unemployment family breakdown loneliness homelessness and migration the aids epidemic took its place among these major hazards the increase in the size of the older age groups also presents important specific health problems these are due to higher chronic morbidity the requirement for more visits by the physician and days in hospital an increased use of dugs and a heavier utilization of nurses homehelp and nursing homes these are all matters which will demand a high priority for resource allocations in the coming years  mean life expectancy at birth in europe varies from  years russian federation to more than  years iceland figure  in all european countries women have a higher lifeexpectancy than men on average  years more the gap seems indeed to be widening women are tending to live even longer whereas the lifeexpectancy for men seems to be levelling off the national differences in length of life are probably to some extent due to differences in the standard of public health services but the contributions of economic variation und unhealthy lifestyles are undoubtedly of much greater consequence this is reflected within different countries in social class differences in mortality major public health problems in europe the main causes of death in the region in most age groups are diseases of the cardio vascular system cancers and accidents suicides are important and so is mortality from traffic accidents the main causes of chronic disability are accidents stroke and other vascular diseases chronic lung diseases mental diseases and disorders senile dementia arthritis and the physical disabilities of extreme old age the main determinants of health lie outside the traditional health sector health policy cannot remain a matter for health centres hospitals or other healthcare services alone yet there are still serious problems in mobilizing the expertise of health professionals and applying their findings and recommendations in health policy areas outside their traditional framework of employment meanwhile the roles of national governments are chiefly restricted to controlling costs guaranteeing equity in the distribution of resources and developing local services there is little evidence of engagement with true health objectives these deficiencies are serious and acceptable solutions to these problems have not in general been found   iceland san marino norway spain eu members before may  luxembourg austria eura

of social endeavour are becoming quite serious the size of the hospital sector is a crucial determinant of total costs the distribution of resources between hospital care and ambulatory care is a

policies actions and outcomes of importance are those originating from the public sector it is the activities of health department bureaucracies and associated bodies of publicly funded public health research and teaching institutions and the laws and regulatory  provisions generated by health ministers that are taken to be the obvious subjects matter to consider when assessing the practice of public health in a country however an emerging dialogue within public health spheres is focusing on evidence that the health of the community and the fruits of the labours of those selfconsciously engaged in explicit public health occupations are hardly coextensive an »intersectoral« perspective on both analysis and action to improve the health status of populations is increasingly being recognized as fundamental to any consideration both of how the health status of populations does change and of questions concerning efficiency in the roles and work of those public sector agencies that have traditionally addressed public health  the impacts direct and indirect on health resulting from the policies and actions or other nonhealth government portfolios such as employment consumer affairs education housing the environment and agriculture from nongovernmental agencies such as pensioners associations leisure and sporting groups and from the private sector eg the food pharmaceutical sunscreen and product safety design industries are demonstrably of immense importance in variously promoting or retarding public health future prospects of public health services these programmes will be closely associated with the development and provision of primary health care in the twentyfirst century the fundamental policy for health services should be established on the basis of the real health needs of the residents and of an action plan which takes into account these various levels of health needs  it is thus important to create effective organizations and functional structures for primary  secondary and tertiary health care systems in the community by the integration of social resources with existing infrastructures such as social insurance welfare services educational systems labour standards and employment policies communications and transportation and local industrial development comprehensive healthcare systems should promote a wide range of activities such as promotion of health prevention of diseases medical care and in industry and also the development of international health services needless to say the most important problems in public health services in more developed countries can be said to be those associated with the rapid ageing of the population and related effects changes in the disease pattern increasing demand for medical care and welfare services and limitation in social resources these indicate the very important role that public health services must play and the responsibility they have in comprehensive healthcare systems  health promotion – major challenge for public health services the member states of the world health organisation who had on encountering contemporary health problems laid new foundations for a longterm health policy popularly called “health for all”  which was updated in  and is now known as “health ”  the health for all policy frameworks for the who european region for the st century  the basic principles of this policy are • health is a fundamental human right • equity in health and solidarity in action by reducing gaps in health status between and within all countries and their inhabitants  • participation and accountability of individuals groups institutions and communities for continued health development in  the ottawa charter for health promotion was adopted  which is considered the key strategy for implementation of the new health policy this document outlines a comprehensive strategy for health promotion trough five interactive means of action that cover the whole range of the new approach to health • building healthy public policy • creating environments supportive to health • strengthening of community action • development of personal skills and • reorienting of health care services toward primary health care although health is above all considered a personal value it is the very influence of working and living conditions which are practically beyond the control of an individual that makes the society and its organisations responsible for creating the conditions of “a healthy choice being the easier choice” such a radical change in attitude towards health as well as in chances of its implementation and improvement requires a lot more than the mere adoption of global orientation one should not neglect the fact that various social sectors having major impact on human health were caught completely unprepared for such changes so there are still many parts of developing and developed countries where even today after more than twenty years no changes can be observed – who   organisations to play the “promoter” role health promotion represents an extremely ambitious public health intervention in the society which is in europe already present  the success of such intervention however depends on the knowledge about and accuracy of the structure and dynamics evaluation for the system we wish to exert influence upon it should be pointed out that this can not be compared to building a new house on bare ground and in ideal conditions all health promotion efforts have been addressing a complex hardly recognisable social structure network in which resources and energy already interweave any modification is to affect all parts of such network case study public health services in slovenia historical perspective the organised preventive health services have a long tradition in slovenia with the central institute of hygiene in ljubljana established already in  to be soon afterwards also followed by the district hygiene stations  the activities of the institute of hygiene followed the ideas of dr andrija štampar the then director of the department of hygiene at the ministry of health and the ideological promoter of social medicine during a period of first two decades the institute of hygiene founded about  community health centres throughout slovenia among them was the community health centre in lukovica near domzale established in  which  was one of the first community health centres in slovenia at that time and which became the prototype for such institutions due to various reasons however this sphere of medicine later failed to keep pace with the development of curative medicine and has in a certain period of time actually proved regressive especially the second world war drastically interrupted the development of public health at that time it was continued only in the s when the population gradually recovering from the war and finding itself in different political circumstances and with different people began to project the further development of public health there were several attempts made to pave the way for the preventive health services mostly in the form of various organisational interventions which in the final phase achieved no desired effect the tasks from the field of social medicine epidemiology and hygiene were performed partly within the basic health services and partly by the institutions which were predecessors of contemporary nine regional institutes of public health and the national institute of public health of the republic of slovenia the cooperation between the individual regional institutes of public health and their linkage with the national institute of public health of the republic of slovenia was scarce and not compulsory except in some joint tasks stipulated by the legislation  at the end of the ’s first radical changes took place which had a significant influence upon the present status and activity of the regional and national institutes of public health a uniform national programme was adopted for the tasks in the field of public health the individual tasks to be performed by the national institute of public health of the republic of slovenia and the regional institutes in this field were defined in detail both the number of personnel and their required qualifications were defined as well and very importantly the funds for the performance of such tasks were also provided at that time all the funds intended for health care were part of the integral national budget current organisational scheme of public health institutions in slovenia public health policy in slovenia for the time being in slovenia we do not have a special act covering public health sector but many of public health issues are covered by the health services act adopted in   according to the health services act  there are nine regional institutes of public health operating in slovenia celje koper kranj ljubljana maribor murska sobota nova gorica novo mesto and ravne covering corresponding health regions figure  and the national institute of public health of the republic of slovenia the health services act gives a more detailed definition of the services of social medicine epidemiology hygiene and environmental health  according to the content and sphere of activity they could be summarized into four main fields  figure  nine health regions of slovenia where regional institutes of public health were established  health situation monitoring and analysis research development and implementation of innovative public health solutions  collection analysis and interpretation of health informatics data and evaluating of health care system  surveillance and control of risks and damages in public health surveillance of communicable and non communicable diseases health promotion and supporting healthy lifestyles strengthening communities and improving health for vulnerable groups  analysis of data on environmental health with special emphasis on air water and foods quality including of assessment of the health risk due the environment and preparation of measures to preserve health of population beside these professional tasks which are partly financed by government numerous other tasks are performed  services of the laboratories for microbiology and for chemistry samples of human and environmental origin  monitoring of environmental elements  counselling in different sphere of public health  different expert and research projects and  education tertiary level the national level of public health in slovenia is in the domain of the institute of public health of the republic of slovenia  short history as described earlier this institution was established in  its first tasks were monitoring the quality of drinking water and milk and preparing expert opinions about safe drinking water supply two years later the institute merged with the ljubljana permanent bacteriological station broadened its activities and reorganized into three units • the bacteriologicalserological laboratory • unit for monitoring the drinking water and food provisions and • unit for hygiene promotion and education the institute was reorganized into the central hygienic institute in may  its tasks were to monitor the health of the population and improve it by taking appropriate preventive measures to monitor and improve the hygiene in the country to prevent and control communicable diseases and to develop and coordinate the work of all hygienic stations in  the institute reorganized again into the institute of the socialist republic of slovenia for health care the activities of the institute covered the fields of socialmedicine hygiene epidemiology and preparation of technical recommendations for health carerelated legislation the contemporary institute of public health of the republic of slovenia iphrs was established in   current organization currently activities of the iphrs are organized within five centres two special units and three laboratory departments   iphrs centres • center for population health research • center for health care organization economics and informatics • center for environmental health • center for communicable diseases and • center for health promotion  iphrs special units • health statistics unit and • informational unit for illicit drugs  iphrs laboratory departments • department for sanitary chemistry • department for sanitary microbiology and • department for human microbiology including reference laboratories the iphrs professionally links the otherwise autonomous regional institutes which will be presented later and in cooperation with them performs the tasks of the adopted national programme such solution does not encroach upon the independence of individual institutes yet dictates a similar if not the same organisational pattern as the performance of joint tasks would otherwise be hindered  secondary level as described earlier there are nine regional institutes of public health covering corresponding health regions figure  the populations they are taking responsibility for are of very different sizes from about  to about  the details are presented in table  table  the sizes of populations nine regional institutes of public health in slovenia are taking responsibility for           regional institute of public health celje koper kranj ljubljana maribor murska sobota nova gorica novo mesto ravne approximate population size          all regional institutes of public health in slovenia have more or less similar organization which is also very similar to the organization of the institute of public health of the republic of slovenia they all have three major departments • social medicine department – major activities of this department are health statistics and assessment of health status of the population covered by the regional institute and proposals for necessary public health interventions in the context of social medicine • environmental health hygiene department – major activities of this department are monitoring of parameters of environmental health outdoor parameters such as air soil water and food and indoor parameters of dwelling and occupational places risk assessment and proposals for necessary public health interventions in the context of environmental health the other part of activities is health inspection of food industry processes potable water supply networks swimming pools etc • department for communicable diseases epidemiology  major activities of this department are communicable diseases surveillance and proposals for necessary public health interventions in the context of communicable diseases epidemiology vaccinations and counselling to passengers to regions at high risk for communicable diseases also are in the domain of this department beside presented activities health promotion is coming to agenda of regional institutes of public health in slovenia more and more clearly what will be discussed later on some of them already have special units dealing with health promotion issues while in others health promotion activities are incorporated in activities of other departments  in addition to joint undertakings the regional institutes of public health perform some other tasks as well an important activity and thus the source of funds is the laboratory activity human and sanitary microbiology sanitary chemistry as well as performance of several other tasks for the needs of individual organisations private persons and local communities primary level one should place a special emphasis on the role of the national institute of public health of the republic of slovenia and the regional institutes of public health in connecting and coordinating various health institutions eg community health centres and private sector in the implementation of preventive health care at the primary level in the past a lot was unclear in the implementation of preventive programmes at the primary level those programmes were not carried out equally in all places neither in the scope nor in the quality by introducing private practices and the institution of a personal physician it often happened that individual population groups were not included in the preventive programme for this reason the ministry of health reached a decision and at the beginning of  issued special legal regulation being instructions for the implementation of preventive health protection at the primary level  with the detailed instructions for the implementation of preventive health care at the primary level in those instructions the content and the method of preventive programme implementation have been precisely defined in the following spheres  • reproductive health care • health care for babies and infants till the age of  • health care for school children and youth till the age of  • health care for students • dental care for children and youth • health care for adults in general practice • health care for persons in the nursing care treatment and • health care for sportsmen this way a uniformity of such services can be achieved in slovenia furthermore the minister appoints experts responsible for each sphere of preventive health care who are in charge of the proper implementation of the programme health promotion – major challenge also for slovene public health services in view of the situation in slovenia we should not be completely satisfied despite some advantage we have over other countries we can boast a clearly defined orientation towards primary health care one of the main focuses of this policy as well as rich infrastructure of preventive institutions besides some preventive health care measures have the tradition of several decades all this might be one of the reasons why our attitude became even more demanding and as such calls for a more  energetic approach to implementation of basic principles of joint european health policy but why is this so to put it briefly the major problem lies in our inability to determine who is to take the initiative the existing professions and organisations have their specially defined roles and tasks and have as such adapted to solving of the problems for which they were established andor formed a problem of a particular nature is that the society still holds the prevalent view of considering health as a task and commitment of health professionals and health organisations and not an area of activity to be dealt with also by or rather primarily by outsidehealth professionals and organisations in slovenia from organizational point of view the existing public health organisations already have their tasks and roles defined and assigned the present health care system puts emphasis on solving problems of ill health diseases which is understandable – ill health certainly is one of the major problems complex and sophisticated organisational systems have been developed for treatment of diseases rehabilitation and compensation of diseases the tasks and professional roles are well defined with their working methods and their daily routine moreover they enjoy the benefit of being supported by the system of finance and education  nevertheless health is not viewed as a problem so we have not yet reached the decision what institution is to undertake the tasks in health promotion no particular social system can be made responsible for health promotion as this issue addresses several systems at the same time figure   illness economics social services health services science education family health figure  there is no particular system for health health enters each system  there is however at least in slovenia a possibility that certain tasks related to health promotion are undertaken by the public health services which are in slovenia the institutes of public health organised at the national and regional level and considered the central preventive institutions able to play an active role in health promotion numerous connections both from the institutional as well as territorial aspect fostered for the purpose of performing various professional tasks have enabled the formation of an extremely rich network of adapted means of communication these organisations have the distinction of great flexibility and are more than others able to seek paths yet not trodden and to create new social network required in the implementation process of health promotion strategy figure  shows the complexity of connections made by eg regional institute of public health the interconnections among individual organisations are not shown although rich in number as well the advantages of the institutes of public health when applying for the “promoter” role in the implementation process of health promotion strategy are • wide scope of connections made with various social subsystems and their organisations • variety of communications skills • variety of professions tasks and working methods used and thus more open for successful introduction of new forms of work • awareness and understanding of the importance and possibilities of health promotion mass media local community schools ministry of health bussiness partners civilian associations regional institute of public health international organizations governmental authorities ngos health organizations national institute of public health local authorities figure  different communications and connections held by the each of regional institutes of public health in slovenia  to be able to perform their task properly regional institutes of public health in slovenia also have to undergo certain changes as well to adjust their organizational structure and method of work in compliance with the new tasks  features of health promotion projects in recent years the project management has become the most important tool for performance of new complex tasks this kind of approach to work was initially characteristic only for profit oriented enterprises whereas it can currently also be observed in nonprofit organisations in view of the international health promotion movement the project method represents a fundamental approach to task performance project management is considered a suitable tool for implementation of health promotion in various settings eg business enterprises schools hospitals and can as such also be used in performance of programmes focused on changing lifestyles and improving ecological conditions it is only through the project approach that multisectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation can be implemented which is regarded as essential to the performance of new tasks in health promotion the development and adoption of health promotion policy is important not only at the national regional or local level but also in organisations such as schools hospitals and business enterprises by means of health promotion the health criterion is being introduced into decisionmaking as well as into other activities of a system projects and their successful management has become a favourite instrument in recent years for performing new and highly complex tasks in organisations or in the cooperation between organisations in the international health promotion movement projects have become central implementation strategy project management is an appropriate tool for promoting health in businesses schools or hospitals as well as carrying out programmes on healthy lifestyles and ecological issues features of a health promotion project are • it is a type of organisation to perform complex new tasks of various sectors within a single organisation or among various organisations • it is an instrument to introduce changes planned in an organisation • it mobilises and redirects resources from one or more systems to new tasks • it evaluates and verifies the efficiency of new forms of cooperation and integration among individual departments and organisations • it gives the participants the opportunity to acquire fresh experience and skills to be later incorporated in their everyday activity • it exerts influence on the entire organisation or other organisations taking part in the project development and interaction of knowledge among professionals is an integral part of project management new tasks usually require new expert knowledge as well as different application of knowledge with experience  projects can develop their innovative task solely through development of autonomous activity on the one hand while they on the other hand maintain and make use of their connections with the parent organisation in distinction from the projects in the area of business enterprises where predictions of reactions in the target system are often relatively accurate this is not the case in health promotion projects the response depends on the internal dynamics  of an individual social subsystem and autonomous understanding of the process by such system the provision of proper project management is therefore of vital importance only in this way it is possible to currently adapt goals working methods and forms of intervention in the environment and to follow the project target to the fullest extent special emphasis should be laid upon the gains from the activity within the project for the collaborators and the parent organisation successful work for the project results in utterly positive impact both on an individual project team member as well as on the team as a whole it is of particular importance that through the project activity the innovativeness of an individual can be boosted and developed and the opportunity for ones assertion leads to higher motivation for work motivation is also encouraged by positively oriented interpersonal relationships and high level of work culture created in the team the activity within the project also very favourably reflects in the parent organisation the qualifications acquired by the project team members through such activity often prove useful for their routine professional role social skills and knowledge of organisational development required in the project usually to a large extent satisfy the increased demand for such qualities in the rapid development and organisational complexity of modern society conclusion implementation of health promotion is not possible without radical changes in approach to and method of work as this is the case of intervention in several social subsystems the project method is considered the most adequate tool for implementation of health promotion in organisations national and regional institutes of public health in slovenia have due to their role in the society of today developed various kind of knowledge and skills to facilitate the implementation of project work they are closely connected with several social subsystems so they stand a real chance of undertaking the role of project coordinators in health promotion the benefits gained by the institutes of public health through taking part in health promotion projects will not only be those reflected in broader social community and other organisations the new working methods will above all find their most rapid and positive expression in the very same institutes ie in the process of performing their regular professional tasks exercises task  carefully read this module and recommended reading  especially section   the organization financing and

information through a multitude of sources etc the added complexity of the interactions in the health system where both patient and the doctor play a crucial role deserves much attention if we are aimed at reducing the inequality sociomedical and ethical disparities defining sociomedical issues according to definitions in some standard worldwide renowned dictionaries  the term sociomedical dimensions of health care practice refer to the relations of practicing medicine in the societal context under such definition we can look at number of aspects some of which are already defined in monetary terms equity equality healthcare spending in sociolegal terms physicianpatient relationship institutionpatient relationship patients’ rights or which are still in developmental stage or at the level of concept like patient safety for example further below we will look at each in the attempt to define the complex milieu of the interrelatedness of medicine and society yet more focusing on the legal and social aspects this will ultimately give us an idea of how to address problems that might occur at the crossroad between medicine as science represented by the medical profession and the subjects of society represented by the patients and other users of medical services equity a key consideration in addressing the performance of any health care system including those of the see countries to which this book is dedicated is equity equity in health means that ideally everyone should have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential and more pragmatically that no one should be disadvantaged from the achieving this potential if it can be avoided  in terms of health care delivery it means that citizens get the care they need without  consideration of their social status or other personal characteristics such as age gender ethnicity or place of residence  equity addresses questions such as whether some groups in the society have better access to health care or better health benefits and outcomes than others  the term inequity in health refers to differences in health which are not only unnecessary and avoidable but in addition are considered unfair and unjust  equality the equality in healthcare is usually associated with the economic and social equality in the society it is true to some extent as wilkinson states “the greater the economic and social inequality within a society the lower the health outcomes”  yet there is another aspect of equality of access to healthcare which should be considered as vital part of the medical care in each country as canadian commissioner on future of healthcare in canada in his report explains the rapid growth of private magnetic resonance imaging mri clinics which permit people to purchase faster service and then use test results to “jump the queue” back into the public system for treatment is a troubling caseinpoint  and can disturb the balance of the system offering lower possibilities to those that cannot afford private services that are otherwise available under the insurance scheme this becomes a fertile ground for flourishing the financial discrimination within the socialwelfare healthcare systems healthcare spending spending on health care does usually appear to make a difference in health outcomes health indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality clearly show that problems are ameliorated when spending increases  a financially inefficient system however may use additional health resources to provide higher salaries to health care providers without a corresponding improvement in services  it may also lead to shift of health services demand from the freeofcharge public health services to private outofpocket paid services which to a large extent instigates the financial discrimination between those that can and those that cannot afford the private payment for services otherwise available under the basic insurance package at the other end of the spectrum there are those that due to poor accessibility cannot benefit from the health system despite the fact that they may belong to the category that needs it most unfortunately the available data on healthcare spending in some countries is recorded only for the public healthcare institutions  who give a much fragmented and highly unrealistic picture while the private healthcare services are flourishing especially for the basic package of health services physicianpatient relationship the sensitivity of this issue when it comes to the scope of sociomedical problems in healthcare delivery is obvious from its defining it represents a relation of two parties that are equal in the mission to sustain improve promote one’s health condition but are unequal in many other aspects like specialist knowledge and medical information information asymmetry objectivity in approaching the problem and sobriety to make informed decision this to a large extent explains the  paternalistic roles very commonly taken in the physicianpatient relationship rather than the paternalistic concept of the health care system several countries reported a similar situation with the physicianpatient relationship in some occasions even expressed as “the fatherphysician taking care of the childpatient”  patients health service users healthcare professional healthcare institution ministry of health health insurance system figure  relationships and flow of healthcare spending despite the benefits they have brought to the individual and the society the medical advances in the areas of lifeprolonging technology prenatal diagnoses organ transplantation and genetics have all had side effects of increasing the technological and decreasing the human aspects of medical care these advances brought and enlarged the alienation between patients and physicians at times physicians forget or simply do not have time to be compassionate they often perceive themselves as absolute authorities in judging patient needs due to their medical knowledge supremacy and they do not perceive the need to discuss diagnoses and proposed treatment with patients that in their opinion are not capable of making reasonable decisions thus the most common complaints of patients across the national milieus investigated are that in largest number of cases the physicians don’t listen don’t take much time and don’t explain or give a partial explanation in a difficult to understand referring to the professional and specialized terms language at the same time if anything happens beyond the expected procedure the physicians would in the first place “blame it on” the patient for noncompliance  whereas the patients would consider it to be the physician’s mistake for any of the above reasons to this end it is often difficult to quantify the influence but the relationship between the physician and the patient should have its place in the model defining the sociomedical problems at least on a qualitative level institutionpatient relationship in many cases the hospital visit and the patient’s health are usually associated with the patientphysician relationship to a large extent besides the expertise  professionalism and ethical principles of the medical personnel but the preparedness and level of equipment of the healthcare setting plays crucial role in the outcome of certain intervention this is another angle of the complex health systems’ relations patientinstitution relationship most of national legislations are regulating the right of the patient to access to healthcare but also the right to healthcare itself to access to medications and technology based on maximum availability in the system – rights and conditions that cannot be regulated and met by the physician alone in this sense the need to include the patientinstitution relationship into the equation for understanding and solving sociomedical problems is evident and further more it can be quantified in monetary terms health profession als healthcare setting patient figure  interrelatedness of physicianpatientinstitution rights and professionals responsibilities – patients vs healthcare as in every relationship patients and physicians in their interaction have both rights and responsibilities as much as this might sound inhumane and too bureaucratic in lot of cases these rights or responsibilities have been a driving force or inhibiting factor to proceeding with interventions much more than the substantial medical knowledge or practice  despite the fact that both patients and physicians are on the same side of the healthcare system  with their mission being health condition improvement or life prolongation  the ethics of holding each of them responsible against the inequality of their positions explained above becomes a complex issue not only difficult to prove and measure but also unpopular to convert into monetary value  in each country there are at least several mechanisms for addressing the violation of the rights or noncompliance with the responsibilities by patients or health professionals ranging from health mediators inhouse clinical patients’ advocates ombudsman administrative and court procedures civil and criminal the level of their implementation or applicability is always questionable for both technical and ethical reasons such as lack of medical knowledge of judges or justifiable compassion with the peer physician in a case of unintentional medical error and adverse outcomes thus the intention is for the concept to go beyond the simplified version of “good guybad guy” situations but to rather look into the potentials of objectivising the cases and anonymization of malpractices  for future use of the casebased knowledge in extending the medical practice this aspect is further elaborated under the section of patient safety patient safety the concept of patient safety happens to be a relatively recent initiative as a response to the generally low level of awareness and knowledge about the frequency and magnitude of avoidable adverse outcomes in healthcare industry the first serious approach to this issue was given in s when reports in several countries revealed a staggering number of malpractice patient injuries and deaths each year  patient safety is a serious concern in most developed and developing countries alike recent studies consistently show in an increasing number of countries that health care errors occur in around  of hospitalizations  the concept of the patient safety is described with many operational definitions  each defined by the research context in general the term patient safety describes the tendency to provide conditions and interventions for patients in the healthcare settings that would enable and ensure the desirable outcome the broadness of this concept embraces both medical and nonmedical errors that can incur during the patient visit or stay at the healthcare setting nevertheless the scientific literature shows that the healthcare sector is a decade or more behind other highrisk industries in its attention to ensuring basic safety for its key players both patients and health professionals  aviation for example has focused extensively on building safe systems since world war ii between  and  the us airline fatality rate was less than onethird the rate experienced in mid century  in  there were no deaths in the united states in commercial aviation in health care preventable injuries from care have been estimated to affect between three to four percent of hospital patients  yet the patient safety does not imply responsibility only on the physicians and healthcare settings  it involves other medical professionals such as pharmacists through their contact with the patients education about use and abuse of medications etc and patients themselves  with their understanding of the procedures and willingness to comply with given instructions regardless if the advice is aimed at improved nutrition or regularity of taking medicines both can equally affect the patient and hisher role in increasing own safety as patient under the luxembourgian presidency of eu in april  the european commission dg for health and consumer protection issued the declaration “patient safety  making it happen” widely known as the luxemburg declaration  the declaration calls for active involvement of eu institutions in establishment of eu forum to discuss issues regarding patient safety in cooperation with other patient safety initiatives like the who alliance on patient safety etc the declaration recommends to the national authorities to establish national forums to ensure full and free access to personal health information to patients to optimize the use of new technologies and above all to work towards creating a culture that focuses on learning from near misses and adverse events as opposed to concentrating on “blame and shame” and subsequent punishment  denmark became the first example of a country that introduced nationwide mandatory reporting of medical errors and adverse outcomes the danish act on patient safety  enacted by the danish parliament in  sets the ground for obligatory reporting of adverse events by the frontline personnel to a national reporting system the famous article  of this act  which reads “a health care professional reporting an adverse event shall not as a result of such reporting be subjected to disciplinary investigations or measures by the employing authority supervisory reactions by the national board of health or criminal sanctions by the courts” is opening a space for professional yet sincere debate grounds for gathering analyzing and communicating the knowledge of adverse events in order to reduce the number of such events in the healthcare system in january  the national reporting system on adverse events in denmark was set in place obliging not only the frontline personnel to report but also the hospital owners to act on the reports and the national board of health to communicate learning from the reports after making data anonymous and in that way lifting it to the meta analytical level more details of this reporting system are available from the national board of health and danish society for patient safety dsfp   figure  adverse event reporting in the danish healthcare system  modified  pso  patient safety officer case study mediation in healthcare for simple overcoming of the sociomedical problems in the health practice they can be negotiated and potentially resolved with good will and without judicial intervention by introduction of health mediators and patients’ advocates who are taking up a role of a neutral middleperson in sensitive healthrelated issues these forms have been more or less successfully adopted in romania health mediators and serbia patients advocates thus this case study is illustrating their existing and potentially expanding role in solving sociomedical problems for a wider range of healthrelated issues including professional patterns of behaviour adverse events and malpractice romani health mediators in romania roma health mediators rhms are members of the romani community who work with their communities physicians and national health care systems to improve romani health as attempt to challenge the health conditions of the  to  million roma living in western and eastern europe exhibit some of the region’s worst health indicators  infant mortality rates among romani communities in the czech and slovak republics and hungary are about double the national average  one of the most visible elements of the government strategies for addressing the health issue of roma is introduction of the programs for roma health mediators rhm rhm programs are meant to respond to the current situation and stereotyped conditions of the romani population by selecting individuals from romani communities to work as mediators who a facilitate communication between romani patients and physicians during medical consultations b communicate with romani communities on behalf of the public health system c provide basic health education and d assist roma in obtaining the health insurance or identity documents necessary to visit the doctor  although a similar concept in education was developed in france in  the leading country in the introduction of this comprehensive concept to healthcare mediators is romania as the statistics is showing that large percentage of romani population in this country is not properly covered by health insurance due to various reasons such as traditional practices or lack of personal identification documents the health status of this minority has been steadily showing a downwards trend with different disease structure than the general population the initiator of the rhm was the nongovernmental organization criss roma center for social intervention and studies which in  has introduced it as pilot version through training health mediators to provide liaison between roma families and mainstream public health services  funding it through international and domestic project schemes in august  the ministry of family and health passed an ordinance making roma health mediator an official profession within the romanian public health system  according to the ministry’s ordinance all mediators must be trained and certified by romani criss the romani criss theoretical training covers communication access to prevention and treatment services the public health  insurance system and first aid however rhms must not provide any medical services as they are not qualified medical providers  in addition to the standard curriculum a small percentage of the mediators have also been trained by romani criss to address discrimination the training structure is somewhat flexible and training in a long distance format is possible  graduates of the theoretical training must complete a threemonth on the job apprenticeship with a “qualified medical staff person”  in  the ministry of health and family asked county public health departments and romani organizations to send their suggestions regarding whether or not mediation was required how many mediators were needed and nominations for who should fill this role approximately  rhms now work throughout romania geographic distribution is based on need as well as local level willingness to participate rhms are currently paid about € monthly which is equivalent to a nurse’s salary they are supervised by local and national authorities as well as informally by romani criss each rhm is assigned to a local contact gp who is based in a nearby health facility the gp meets weekly with the rhm to discuss tasks completed and any problems a representative of the family and social assistance section of the local county public health department has monthly meetings with each mediator to provide additional supervision and any required assistance  the family and social assistance section should also reimburse rhms for travel costs associated with their work in terms of interactions with national agencies the rhms have four meetings per year with staff from the ministry of health’s department for the health of mother and child and must respond to an annual ministry questionnaire a representative of romani criss phones each mediator about every two months to discuss how work is progressing  the concept also has its disadvantages and problems despite the fact that local authorities had nominated them some rhms had problems being hired following the initial trainings moreover many medical staff and county public health departments did not understand the role of the mediator and required substantial support from romani criss and the ministry of health and family to cooperate effectively with the rhms however this is certainly an initiative that can be expanded when it comes to addressing the health needs of the romani population and which can be adjusted and replicated for the general population in the rural areas patients advocates in healthcare settings in serbia the new law on health protection  of the republic of serbia established a system for protection of patients’ rights as a powerful tool for mediation and solving one of the largest categories of sociomedical problems in the healthcare practice the article  of the aforementioned law  which regulates the right to complaint is also stipulating the mandate and responsibilities of the patients’ rights advocates “zastitnici prava pacijenata” among other the law stipulates that the healthcare settings are responsible to provide conditions for work of the patients’ rights advocates the director is appointing the advocate from the employees of the healthcare setting most usually the lawyer of the healthcare institution procedures  are set for both oral and written complaint with timeframes within which the patients’ advocate has to respond to the complaint in a form of legal advice opinion or information the law also regulates the format of the written complaint to be submitted when patient right has been violated the patients’ rights advocate has obligation to submit written monthly report to the director of the healthcare setting and a sixmonth report to the board of the healthcare institution and to the ministry of health second level procedure includes complaint filed to the ministry of health of serbia after what if the patient is not satisfied with the reply and still believes that hisher rights have not been exercised and implemented heshe or a member of their family can forward to using court procedures the main role of the patients’ rights advocates is to mediate a dispute between the patient and the healthcare setting or healthcare professional in a peaceful and good will manner using this procedure most cases of general misunderstanding or misinformation about rights and responsibilities can be resolved thus avoiding extra burden on the judicial system in the country effective as it sounds however this system already existing in some other developing and developed countries has its own drawbacks such as subjectivity of the advocate who works for one of the sides for which heshe has to mediate exercise task

who policy “health for all” defines ten global goals and one of them is relating to health care quality “improvement of comprehensive high quality health care” there are numerous definitions of health care and who defines it as “the level where delivered health care achieves the best results establishing the balance between the risk and benefit within specified economic conditions” basic dimensions of quality are equality relevance accessibility acceptability effectiveness and efficiency motives for establishing the system of quality in health care are professional socioeconomical patients’ satisfaction and the final and the most important at the same time – improvement of population health modern concept of quality means implementation of tqm total quality management and cqi continuous quality improvement that represent managing strategies whose main steps are managing consciousness strategic planning management implementation and training of employees principles are that patients’ needs opinions and experience are the important information in permanent improvement of quality that it has to be integrated part of everyday work that all employees in the system of health care have

should be based on data and information not on assumptions significant parameter of quality is also patients’ satisfaction which is defined by who as “the level when the health system has satisfied

introductory lecture exercises individual work and small group discussions • work under teacher supervision individual students’ work proportion  • facilities a teaching room • equipment computer lcd

theroretical background introduction one of ten global goals of who policy “health for st century” is “improvement of comprehensive high quality health care” this who policy approach has opened new prospective and one of them is to focus the entire concentration to final effects of health care the one that considers health promotion disease prevention diagnostics treatment rehabilitation not like separate entities but as permanent group of activities aimed to improve health such approach is supported by health services and care system that is structurally and functionally integrated both horizontally and vertically therefore one of specific goals within the global objective “integrated health sector” is “that all people should have better access to familyandcommunity oriented primary health care by  supported by flexible and responsible hospital system in particularly at least  of countries should have comprehensive primary health care enabling continuity of care through efficient costeffective referral systems and feedback from secondary and tertiary hospital care results of health care in at least five priority health problems should be significantly improved and investigation should identify the greater satisfaction of patients with the quality of delivered care”  the question comes out what is the quality in general and what is quality in health care and how to estimate it quality of health care can be defined as “the level of excellence achieved and documented in the process of diagnostics and therapy based on the best knowledge which achieves the less possible mortality and morbidity” or “the level on which the health system increases possibility of desired effects” according to iso international organization for quality  quality of health care is defined as ”the level where the group of more characteristics of products or services satisfy specific or expected requirements” while some define quality as “that systematic critical analysis of health care quality also includes procedures used in diagnostics and therapy then resources and results of effects patient’s quality of life  at the other hand standards of health care quality should be at the level where the health care is available suitable and continual and documented as well as to be at the level where the adequate therapy is based on the precise diagnosis not on the symptomatology deming one of creators of the concept of quality management emphasizes that “quality should focus its activities to existing and future requirements of users” who defines quality as “the level where delivered health care achieves the best results creating the balance between risk and benefit within existing economic conditions”  there are other numerous definitions of quality and therefore one american physician said that “quality is difficult to define impossible to measure but easy to recognize”  in general those without enough experience in clinical field require easy precise and complete measures the truth is that some elements of quality are easy to be defined and measured while the others require more complex procedures  quality means the level of excellence and it is recommended that quality development shouldn’t be administrative control of previously defined quality levels but it is a dynamic process health service should be organized in a way that medical results are the main in input identification process definition and evaluation of results output the whole process has to be directed towards improvement of health patients’ satisfaction and costeffectiveness in contrast to traditionally managing concept dimensions characteristics and quality elements maxweell defines six basic dimensions of quality in health care   equality – offering the same health care to persons with the same needs regardless to their participation to some social or other group  relevance – means the requirements of community for health care ie solving priority health problems  accessibility – meaning that health care should be available in geographical time and functional sense  acceptability – suitable for population  effectiveness – to make right things in the right way that bring results and  efficiency – to make right things in the right way ie to use available resources rationally high quality components include high degree of professional excellence regarding to actual situation and available technology efficiency in resource utilization minimal risk for patient patients’ satisfaction and final outcome of delivered health care the key element is that quality is complex and multidimensional and very often it is not easy to be quantitatively expressed in a simple way main characteristics of modern system of quality in health care are − it is focused to the user − the process of quality improvement is managed by the highest leadership − each person in health institution has responsibility for quality − it is directed to prevention of errors not to their detection and − quality has to be accepted as the lifestyle in health institution the key elements of health care quality are customer commitment expectations and continuity these elements all together make the quality diamond  the customer is in the centre of the health care system each patient has to be examined individually and not as anonymous person classified in some group diseased etc it has to be taken care that any patient is not the same that each of them has its own specific problems needs and expectations commitment starts from the physician both towards patent and quality because without commitment nothing  representing the full meaning of quality is going to be achieved patients’ expectations have to be recognized as well and they have to be satisfied and if it is possible to overcome it while health care requires continuity continuity enables permanent consistent concentration towards quality to be permanently improved and never to be finished quality has to be incorporated in all activities and gradually it becomes habit customer customer commitment commitment continuity continuity expectations expectations figure  the quality diagram from graham n quality in health care – theory application and evolution aspen publishers jnc gaitheoburg maryland  − − − − the most precious parts in quality diamond are patients’ satisfaction motivation of the staff professional work and successful practice quality diamond describes what is considered to represent four critical elements of health care quality and it should be taken care not to ignore any of these elements sometimes there are various obstacles in implementation of quality such as insufficient commitment sometimes it is difficult to decide wherefrom to begin the action sometimes quality is treated like additional work and sometimes there are just attempts to do something exceptionally rapid or excessively much that is also the fact to be taken care in decision making concerning establishment the system of quality  reasons for establishing the system of quality the answer to the question why to establish system of quality in health care is of high significance aiming also to find justification and purpose of these activities  according to donabedian the answers are going to be different depending on who is asking that question but a few basic motives can be noticed − professional motivation is of vital importance in order to motivate medical staff to be more active in enabling and improving of health care quality certainly one of professional elements is also desire of an individual to develop and improve its own work but characteristic for all medical professionals is also their ethical approach towards their profession related to this is the fact that obtaining the quality is observed as the way to notice shortages and more important as the way and possibility to improve quality in everyday work participation and engagement of medical professionals in establishing and application of the quality system is also professional challenge for all employees and their additional motivation for work and it is important mechanism in identification and analyses of differences in results of health care that is the basis for further activities in improvement of quality − socioeconomic motivation is also important for activities in the field of quality improvement quality in health care is the measure for efficiency that indicates not only to importance in achieving of particular results but also to efficient and rational allocation of available resources in order to obtain desired results but financials spent to health care have to be justified health care becomes increasingly expensive and at the same time an increasing disappointment is expressed because principles of equality effectiveness efficiency and quality in health care are not much more expressed including patients’ satisfaction with available health care − patients’ satisfaction is important parameter of health care quality that also includes their expectations and their assumptions on health service but also represents the result of delivered care and treatment and finally it represents essential contribution in further treatment since it inspires patient to continue cooperation with physician in order to solve his own health problems all together with other motives should lead to − improvement of population health as the general and main goal of entire activities in health care  tqm and cqi after the ii world war the new concept of quality is developed – tqm total quality management and cqi continuous quality improvement tqm is “universal strategy of organizational changes and also the change of attitudes that enables people to learn how to use methods for improvement of quality in order to be able to reduce costs for health care and to satisfy needs of patients and other users professionals… tqm is in the same way philosophy of management just like its method and it has four main functions that are defined as the basis of good management − strengthening of clinicians and managers in health care to gain knowledge to conduct analysis of work process in order to be able to improve it − acceptance of the attitude that the patient is not the only user in health care but it is also the health worker and also the adoption of standards where the user is the primary goal in the quality  − development of multidisciplinary approach which is above and out of conventional limitations like departments specializations etc − enabling the motivation for rational data based approach to the process of analysis and changes  both concepts are managing strategies described as “permanent efforts of all members in particular organization focused to needs and expectations of customers” regardless to numerous critics that application of tqm and cqi in health care is only “temporary fashion” just in usa these programs are applied in around of  hospitals spending more than a billion dollars annually to them it is also estimated that there are more than  practical guides applied in everyday activity similar situation is also in the other developed western european countries it is interesting to be mentioned that japan as well the leader in quality management in industry is at the beginning of its efforts to introduce tqm and cqi in the field of health care    tqm should be incorporated in the whole organization and the main steps are managing conscience strategic planning implementation of management training of staff team recognition work and of values among the employees improvement of cultures in quality and management total quality techniques of quality communication with employees environment resources of management training standard of the environment and confirmation communication with patients figure  relations in the model of the total quality management from koch h implementing and sustains total quality management in health care longman   for example hospital or some other health institution wishing to present highly qualitative clinical services according to patients’ requirements should have the following elements  delivered services have to be − acceptable − effective − available and − appropriate concerning the patient and other interested subjects  health services have to be organized in the sense of − clear managing devotion leadership and capability − optimal teamwork and recognition of values among employees − implementation of quality techniques existing standards clinical control communication with patients etc − monitoring and identification of performances  quality of health services has to be analyzed at the following levels − hospital level the level of health institution − manager level − specialist level − the level of individual members of employees − the important part in the process of quality management is to enable all processes to be controlled confirmed that are complete documented and also to enable corresponding persons to be included  cqi is based on the following principles − patient’s needs opinions and experience on all aspects of their health care structure process result are important information for permanent quality improvement that should be regularly collected in order to obtain feed back information on delivered health care − permanent quality improvement has to make integrated part of everyday work of all employees − all employees in the system of health care have professional responsibility concerning permanent quality improvement of their work this is related to responsibility from the aspect of presented satisfactory level of health care and from the aspect of patient s and other subjects public etc − activities in permanent quality improvement require cooperation of different profiles of medical workers and other professionals as well as of various sectors − managers at all levels in health institution are responsible for organizational structure that enables incorporated permanent quality improvement in everyday activity − all activities are carried out in order to realize objectives of quality mutually defined by health workers patients and other who make decisions related to health care  − permanent quality improvement means positive approach in everyday work the objective is to identify the best results that are going to be used in further improvement of work quality not only to identify and eliminate unpleasant results and − activities in permanent quality improvement should be based on data and information ie on scientific principles not on assumptions  improvement in culture of quality and managing dedication levels of quality system  hospital level the level of health institution  manager level  specialist level  the level of individual members of employees teamwork and recognition of values in employees resources of managem ent standards and control comm unication with patients technique s of quality training comm unication with employees cost of quality environment hospital available effective acceptable appropriate figure  model of the total quality management from koch h implementing and sustains total quality management in health care longman  patients’ satisfaction significant element in health care quality is patients’ satisfaction concerning delivered health care because users of the system of health care give great contribution in  identification of quality and standards used in measuring of these aspects their opinion and estimation ie their satisfaction is one of measures in health care quality it can be defined in the easiest way as  satisfying of their expectations desires and needs who defines patients’ satisfaction as the result of estimation of an individual about coordination of expected and obtained health care or “the level of satisfied patients’ expectations by health care system” certainly patient is going to be more satisfied if he is not waiting too long for delivery of health service when there is existing continuity of health care and when patient can rely on the same physician every moment and when he is in situation to present his problems without hurry and to obtain clear explanations for recommended treatment including the risk of various procedures   answers why it is important to estimate patients’ satisfaction are as follows − providers of health care desire to satisfy expectations of their patients and therefore their satisfaction is the objective of the universal system of health care − patients’ satisfaction is also the consequence ie the result of provided health care − patients’ satisfaction contributes to positive effects of provided health care because satisfied patient is going to accept recommendations of his physician much better than unsatisfied patient and this is going to have positive influence to the result of treatment and to the quality of his life as well  accreditation in health care system by establishing the system of quality in health care the question of accreditation of health institutions arises accreditation is defined as “the system of external estimation of coordination with the set of standards” the point is that term of accreditation is used to mark the wide range of measures or inspections in health care including certification license acquirement etc in the system of accreditation all procedures have to be documented this documentation should include − the field of activity what has been done − applied procedures how it has been done − quality standards how good it has been done − procedure verification how much we know how good it has been done the accreditation system is the best recognized through the following five characteristics − estimation of performances of health institution − external involvement in estimation that is usually coordinated or is managed by some professional agency − standards which define performance attributes that are to be estimated − measuring of performances regarding standards and identification of parts with identified deviations where changes are necessary and  − report on results of the process of inspection which can include one explicit judgment on the level of performances and whether the acceptable level is achieved while conclusion can also include certain recommendations  the basic objectives ie purposes of accreditation are − quality improvement – using the accreditation process in order to achieve changes in practice that are going to improve health care quality − gaining information in order to make decisions – presenting data on health care quality health insurance fund politicians managers medical professionals public and others who can use these data as the basis in various decision makings and − responsibility because in this way health institution usually responsible to various subjects – government health insurance fund etc – is able to regulate and coordinate its behaviour in order to protect interests of patients and other users accreditation has long history in so called public services particularly in health care the first real accreditation system is developed in usa established by american surgeon association just after the ii world war in  the new organization is formed – mutual commission for hospital accreditation in that period canadian hospitals also took part in activity of this commission since  when canadian association for hospital accreditation has been formed in  accreditation system was established in australia as well during the long period these three counties were the only where accreditation was applied later on the real explosion of accreditation came out in the international level with various accreditation systems in france spain great britain hungary south africa and many other countries reasons for this great interest are numerous – effects in society due to increased consumption increased patients’ expectations changes in health care system  greater than before application of various technologies increased health care expenses etc they all had their part in regulation and explicit measuring in health care nowadays accreditation is very widely applied as an approach in managing and improving of health care quality in many countries various accreditation programs are established and such high variations  regarding the way of implementation who is going to manage the program which standards should be used etc  have many advantages because they offer possibility to achieve new knowledge from different experiences and approaches that reaches to improvement of health care quality and also to improvement of population health quality of life exercise task  discuss with other students the reasons for establishing quality health care and situation in their countries as well as personal and political expectations to the future development of quality care in their countries  task  discuss about patients’ satisfaction with quality of services and possibilities of improvement of their satisfaction

good health to a persons’ ability to live the life he or she wants health care and performance of health care systems are under critical observation in this context many discussions swivel around ethics justice equity equality and fairness very often using these notions interchangeably sometimes they are used as arguments to challenge every economic consideration by claiming “the freedom of therapeutic choices” and pointing out the humanitarian aspect of an individual’s health and the danger of withholding intervention options or rationing it is not surprising to see that many health care professionals and patients see a certain incompatibility between financing operational aspects of health care like allocation of resources and ethical expectations nevertheless this is not necessarily so in the following we will discuss what principles should rule a health care system furthermore conflicts and tradeoffs between performance measures like effectiveness and efficiency and equity considerations will be discussed the provision of health care takes place in a complex system see figure  in the framework for producing health the citizen’s health or patient’s outcomes are determined by several factors it is quite obvious that primarily the configuration of the existing structure of the care environment and the processes by number and quality make up the frame of action and finally determine the patient’s outcomes nevertheless the state of the art of medicine training education and last but not least the financial resources define the portfolio of feasible interventions thus the organization of health care eg financing and provision of care is a limiting variable in this context which deserves specific attention the setup of the health care system is critical to an appropriate and feasible care in western economies health economists think that a suitable organizational makeup of a health care system should fulfil the following criteria  − sovereignty and personal responsibility of citizens − socalled secondary liability of staterun actions − equity horizontally and vertically − effectively and efficiency − sustainability and stability − legal certainty − transparency  determining factors of health care h wenzel structure mix of personal process of care structure character of organ patient mix education training state of the art of medicine patient outcome structure  of hosp gpsetc financial resources financing modus figure  determinants of health care source helmut wenzel unpublished besides criteria that pick out more or less aspects of selfconception and selfdetermination  like sovereignty personal responsibility and elements of performance eg stability  effectiveness and efficiency are seen to be equally important furthermore we expect that the access to health care and the available care should not be limited by the social standing or financial potential limited resources and its usage always raise questions of justice equity considerations are therefore inseparably linked to fair processes of resource allocation the relative importance weights of the various criteria might be different in different societies they have to be seen in the light of a societal consensus  a kind of societal treaty in this treaty it is laid down how a society is made up basically important considerations have to be made with respect to the questions whether the societal selfconception is socialistic communistic or more liberal is the governance autocratic or more democratic and finally is the economy based on freemarket or more regulated depending on the combination of the above features the expectation on the quality of a health care system might vary substantially anyhow questions will come up like what health services should be publicly funded how indications for particular interventions should be defined whether societal groups need specific attention and how researchers from different scientific disciplines have been working on justice ethics or equity in health care with various tools paradigms and intentions philosophers  with the view on justice and ethics came to a similar appraisal as economists who specify criteria for an appropriate health care system however the philosophers’ view is more focused on the “direct” human needs and consequences justice is understood here as an equivalent of normative ethics and the way how moral topics are analyzed it describes primarily a set of tools and methods  they conclude that four principles should be the basis for an ethical evaluation of health  care independent from the makeup of the system they are seen as a kind of normative guidance those principles are  respect for autonomy  beneficence  nonmalefficiency and  justice researchers with focus on medical ethics aiming specifically at regulating the relationship between patient and health care professional have been specifying six principles that should guide the behaviour of an ethical doctor these principles are a preserve life b alleviate suffering c do no harm d tell the truth e respect the autonomy of the patient and f deal fairly with patients none of these principles are absolute or independent each may conflict with the others there might even exist tradeoffs which are quantitydependent hence the binding character of those principles is “prima facie” which means that the binding is unless it conflicts with another moral principle if it does one has to choose between them  the resolution of such conflicts is a matter of personal value judgment unfortunately philosophers don’t provide a method for this kind of appreciation and for solving value conflicts following samuelson’s definition of economics this is the typical domain of economics and health economics he states” the study of how men and society end up choosing with or without the use of money to employ scarce productive resources that could have alternative uses to produce various commodities and distribute them for consumption now or in the future among various people and groups in society it analyses the costs and benefits of improving patterns of resource allocation  equity and ethics as mentioned earlier fairness justice and equity are notions that are often used synonymously to describe concerns about access to health care and the amount of care citizens will get without discrimination the office of health economics ohe outlines this concern as follows “efficiency is not everything we are also concerned with what is fair if we had a market distribution of health care then only those who could afford to pay would be able to purchase it most people regard that as unacceptable this is a major reason why most societies regard health care as different from other commodities” questions regarding equity have been the main reason for government involvement in health care worldwide ohe further states “a concern about equity was one of the main motivating forces behind the creation of the national health service nhs in the uk william beveridge the architect of the welfare state argued for a health service which would provide treatment to every citizen without exception without remuneration limit and without an economic barrier at any point to delay recourse to it equity has remained a major goal within the uk system a concern about equity has also been reflected by other countries approaches to health care mcguire henderson and mooney have pointed out that the introduction of public health insurance in canada in  was explicitly stated to be motivated by a concern to make health care utilization less dependent upon income blewett has suggested that in australia the introduction of medicare in february  was designed to ensure that all australians have access to medical and hospital services on the basis of need even in the us which has the most market orientated health care system in the developed world the state intervened to provide medicare and medicaid to help the poor afford health care”  the content of equity looking at literature there seems to be no uniquely correct way of defining equity and its determination mooney for example listed seven possible definitions equality of expenditure per capita inputs per capita inputs for equal need access for equal need utilization for equal need marginal met need and health he finally comes to the conclusion that a mix of equal inputs for equal need and equal access for equal need might be the most practical feasible description of equity  who refers to equity as “principle of being fair to all with reference to a defined and recognized set of values” more concretely it says “equity in health implies that ideally everyone should have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential and more pragmatically that no one should be disadvantaged from achieving this potential ie everyone should have geographical and financial access to available resources in health care ”  the crux with this statement is that it establishes a relation between the undetermined notion “equity” and the undetermined notion “fair opportunity” a more illustrative definition comes from mayberry et al stating equity means to “provide care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender ethnicity geographic location and socioeconomic status”  for further considerations it turned out to be useful to distinguish between horizontal and vertical equity horizontal equity means equal treatment for equal conditions it applies especially to the delivery of health care eg equal resources utilization and access per head most discussions refer to this in this case the efficiency and equity aspects will tend to move together nevertheless most conflicts are seen in vertical equity vertical equity deals with the question whether unequal cases are treated unequally in prevention one could think about a case where for a majority of a population the risk could be reduced a little and would save fewer lives than concentrating the same resources on a few at high risk the case could be even more delicate when we assume that the few are at higher ages another example if there was a rare blood type of which the hospital only has access to one unit of blood and they at the same time receive two patients who both need one unit of that rare blood one of them is a  year old recent college graduate who was in an accident with a drunk driver and the other is an  year old widower who has been sick for  years representatives of a “fair innings” approach  would say that we should give the unit to the  year old because there is more life to be lived by him than the sick  year old man another case with ethnically grounded disparities and conflicts between efficiency and equity deals with kidney transplants the efficiency of transplantation could be improved by human leukocyte antigens hla matching the closer the match the better is the chance of a successful transplant from the viewpoint of using scarce resources efficiently this matching makes sense gaston et al  found out that this policy discriminates black patients for whom it is less likely to find a match they conclude that for the sake of equity diminished efficiency has to be accepted the philosophical basis of equity even when we refer to the universal principles mentioned earlier the application of moral rules comes to different results obviously the definition of equity and its practical use depends on the underlying not always overt  philosophical theories to  understand ongoing discussions and solutions offered in the literature one has to come back to the philosophical theories the different schools can be classified into utilitarianism rawlsian entitlementlibertarian egalitarian deontological virtue and “rights” oriented theories each of them has a specific focus the underlying concept of utilitarianism is maximizing for the greatest utility for greatest number this is compatible with economic efficiency considerations critical question is whose utilities are meant the rawlsian position expects an allocation conducted under a ‘veil of ignorance’ aiming at balancing between higher and lower risk in people who are discriminated by nativity rawls  “veil of ignorance” means that a principle of allocation would be called just when people would agree on the principles in a situation where they don’t know whether they are sick and whether they would benefit from the principle in fact this theory assumes total risk averseness and leads to a position of less well off in society being maximized entitlementlibertarian robert nozick  holds the view that individuals are entitled to get what they have acquired “justly” within a market situation emphasis is put on freedom of choice and property rights assuming minimal state involvement this is similar to utilitarianism moral rules as a strict guiding principle play the central role in deontological and virtue based theories moral rules like ‘do to others as you would have done to you’ kant depict an absolute moral code of how life should be lived rights based theories focus on indisputable ‘rights’ which cannot be overridden eg ’right’ to life they are absolute and inflexible according to their main focus they also can be divided into theories that deal primarily with distributive justice highlighting fairness of outcomes and those that look at procedural justice concerned with the processes in achieving the outcomes figure  gives an overview figure  categories of ethical theories source health economics network uk the definition of equity is as multifarious as the heterogeneity of philosophical theories which philosophical concept is appropriate for a given health care system and which definition of equity should be chosen depends on the societal consensus even when we accept that the four ethical rules are universal the application of ethics to practical decisionmaking is very much guided by the expectation of a society a  kind of lowest denominator is the criterion of equality of access which is consistent with most ethical theories and consistent with efficiency it preserves consumer sovereignty guidance for analyzing equity in health care disparities may occur at different parts of a network at the level of the health care system at an individual and community level and last but not least on a patientprovider level mayberry et al propose a theoretical framework for the analysis of disparities figure  shows those parts of a kind of influence network indicators of inequality are access use and health outcomes figure  three dimensions of an influence network of inequalities source based on mayberry  the individualenvironment entity covers factors like sociocultural norms and values social network and cohesions and individual health promotion and careseeking behaviour the patientprovider part focuses on communication between patients and provider this includes factor as trust respect patient participation in clinical decisions and ability to navigate the health care system finally the capacity of the health care system is put on a testbench this is in a narrow sense the classical topic for analyzing equity the basic practical problem facing an equity policy is to find out which patients are the worstoff and should receive priority practically it is not easy to determine the degree of inequality rutten even stimulates the creation of an aggregate measure of expected misery  at least on a national or regional level disparities can be determined by calculating measures of statistical dispersion like a gini index or a suits index to display disparities in financing or health  economics in health care compatibility or inexpiable polarity many clinicians and citizens don’t feel comfortable with economically grounded assessments they believe that allowing costs to influence clinical decisions is unethical they are mistaken in this belief it cannot be ethical to ignore the adverse consequences upon others of the decisions you make which is what costs means from an economist’s view of course there are some important ethical issues in deciding what costs to count and how to count them but these dilemmas are equally strong with respect to what benefits to count and how to count them some of which expose ethically untenable assumptions about such widelyused clinical criteria as survival rates one of the advantages of systematic economic appraisal tools like costeffectiveness analysis is that it exposes these hidden assumptions and requires explicit judgments to be made about which ethical position is appropriate in a particular policy context by creating transparency this should have the important incidental benefit of improving the accountability of policymakers to the community they are serving  in opposition to these cited conflicts economists should have no difficulty in seeing their own work in the health care field as being directed towards the fulfilment of those same ethical principles according to their professional terminology they would probably name it differently williams points out that for instance the demand to preserve life and alleviate suffering would be seen as a description of the objectives of health care concentrating our attention on improving both the length and quality of peoples lives the postulation to do no harm would be seen as a request to minimize the risks of adverse effects from treatment and even as a plea for prevention telling the truth is a general duty accepted by all analysts and respecting the autonomy of the patient would be seen as referring to the need to have the patients values count rather than those of the practitioners when decisions about treatment are being made but the final item on the list  about dealing fairly with patients  reminds us that we will seldom find ourselves dealing with situations in which only one patients interests are affected so that we will have to face the problematical question of how much weight to attach to the possibly conflicting values of each affected individual in such circumstances and in any system in which the individual patient pays only part of the costs of care the number of individuals who are affected in one way or another by a treatment decision may be very large indeed  consequently economists have been trying to overcome the vagueness and high level argumentation by breaking down those principles into applicable principles processes and tools the health economist is seeking through the use of appraisal techniques to help decisionmakers to maximize the benefits of health care within the constraint of whatever level of resources society has chosen to devote to health care these benefits are seen as improvements in peoples length and quality of life in which the distribution of these benefits between individuals is a matter of some importance clearly there is nothing there that conflicts with conventional medical ethics even the stress laid by economists on the need to examine carefully the tradeoffs that are established at the margin between the competing good things that we seek in health care simply mirrors the relativity of ethical principles and the acknowledged need to strike a balance between them the difficulties seem to arise because economists go further than others do in the quantification of these elements we must now explore why they do so and for this purpose adopt a somewhat different perspective that of welfare economics   williams explains that economists have sought to avoid making explicit interpersonal comparisons when judging whether one situation is better or worse than another and a whole branch of the subject  ie welfare economics  has grown from that ambitious objective the basic idea is to separate efficiency from equity with efficiency being kept free of interpersonal comparisons of welfare all such judgments being encompassed in equity the definition of efficiency which achieves this separation is due to pareto and hence is often called paretoefficiency and it declares a situation to be efficient if in that situation it is not possible to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off if resources are being used wastefully it should be possible to put them to some other use which will not harm the person from whom they are taken but will benefit those to whom they are given thus the initial situation would have been inefficient the same would generally be true if resources are lying idle or are underutilized in the paretian framework it is the individuals own judgment of whether he or she is better or worse off that counts not the judgment of any third party thus it observes very strictly the ruling to respect the autonomy of the individual no judgments are made about the status quo which is simply accepted as the starting point our only concern being whether or not some change is an unambiguous improvement on it the realm of application of this strict paretian notion of efficiency is however severely limited since there are very few changes in real life that do not adversely affect the welfare of somebody or other to ease this restriction on the applicability of the strict efficiency criterion it was extended to cover situations in which the potential gainers from a change could fully compensate the potential losers and still have some gains left over compensation being paid in money terms say but identifying actual gainers and losers precisely and setting up an incorruptible mechanism to enable such compensation actually to be paid would in most cases be very costly so this compensation principle in turn got watered down to include cases where the compensation did not actually have to be paid thus under the potential pareto criterion it has only to be shown that for a change to be declared efficient the gains must on balance outweigh the losses gains and losses generally being evaluated in money terms to decide whether gains outweigh losses they must be measured in commensurable terms so there has grown up a strong tradition of quantification and valuation which has been applied to all kinds of gains and losses including the value of life and safety calculating the efficiency gains and losses in this way still leaves us with the distributional consequences to think about and these are typically transferred to the equity realm to be evaluated separately in practice they are often ignored however in the hope that in the long run over a multitude of different activities they will all wash out thus the efficiency calculus as used in practice by economists does not really achieve the desired avoidance of all interpersonal comparisons of welfare at best it says there are no losers and it assumes that it does not matter who the gainers are at worst it says that there are both gainers and losers but it is up to somebody else to look at the equity implications  dealing with limited resources no health care system can satisfy all the possible demands made upon it so decisions about allocating resources are of particular importance the allocation takes place at different levels ie allocation between institutions and by type of care for instance decisions have to be made about the amount of money that should be devoted to  hospitals even different kind of hospitals and how much money should go to ambulatory care those decisions are very often overlapped by regional or municipal considerations that lay outside the health care sector and the appropriate provision of care there are connections to other sectors of a national economy and respective goals like strengthening the regional economic performance figure  alternative ways of allocating limited resources based on j coast et al  even more complex are decisions that have to allocate money between the different kinds of prevention cure and rehabilitation again facing the fact that resources will always be limited the question is how this task can be achieved in a way that satisfies most of the expectations of modern democratic societies according to coast  more or less two options exist rationing and explicit priority setting rationing is a crucial issue sometimes it is even misunderstood health care rationing refers to “any planning resource allocation or pruning of ineffective or unproved processes”   rationing is thus merely another term for stating that we must decide how to allocate our limited resources  much rationing takes place by controlling the access to the health care system it is not only debatable who is entitled or authorized to make these decisions it is also critical how the rationing procedure looks like and what are the relevant criteria and who defined it in an implicit rationing procedure the decisions and the preferences are not revealed which is hardly acceptable in modern societies there is no real awareness of the principles used in contrast explicit rationing is concerned with making clear the decisions that have been made and the basis upon which the decisions have been made it results from political bargaining processes andor technical methods as promoted by economist in political processes the consent of society could be received by either lay participation in the decision processes or by the anticipation of the citizen needs by experts in the late sixties this kind of effort to integrate as many citizens with their  specific needs as possible in political planning processes was called advocacy planning the basic and progressive idea was that experts and politicians would be able and willing to anticipate the problems of those people that have not the ability to participate in political processes in a democratic appropriate way in reality this approach was not very successful and should not be seen as a significant option in contrast economists rely on the “art” of making rational choices and promote that choices should be made more explicit and be based on efficiency appraisals  looking at the very nature of health economics the starting point is straightforward “in the beginning middle and end was is and will be scarcity of resources”  and the issue of choice and priorities taking a choice  priority setting means that a decision has to be made not only about what to do but also what to leave undone opportunities forgone  what we leave undone  is central to health economics opportunities forgone are cost “the cost of a unit of a resource is the benefit that would be derived from using it in its best alternative use”  the concept of cost in health economics is different to the concept of cost in accounting that relates to cash outlays therefore when economists argue that attention should be paid to efficiency in health care they are implying that health care programmes treatments and procedures should be compared not only in terms of their relative benefits but also in terms of their relative costs ie benefits forgone the concept of efficiency the concept of efficiency is central to the models and techniques proposed by economists economic theory believes in the rational nature of men paradigm of homo oeconomicus this further leads to the assumption that each individual wants to maximize its degree of satisfaction which is measured in terms of benefits in order to maximize the benefits the individual will make sure that the last unit of money spent will create the same amount of benefit efficiency can be classified into different forms  technical efficiency with two sub forms a costefficiency product applications or intervention strategies which achieve a given health outcome at the lowest level of resource utilization are called efficient or economical this is also called operational efficiency and sometimes costeffectiveness  it refers to the socalled fixed effectiveness approach too b outputefficiency product applications or intervention strategies which generate the best possible outcome or goal achievement for a given resource input are called efficient or most productive this is also called fixed cost approach  allocative efficiency looks at the combination of goods that have to be financed and goes beyond looking for the most costeffective types of interventions this could mean that what conditions should be treated is subject to evaluation as well the theoretical foundation is the definition of efficiency of pareto so called paretoefficiency a situation is perceived to be efficient if it is not possible to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off  efficiency evaluations include an assessment of resource input or costs and outcomes generally speaking efficiency is measured by the relationship between the level of accomplishment of these goals consequences and the resources used or expenditures the fact that something is efficient does not necessarily mean that it will lead to cost reduction cost reduction and efficiency generally represent two different perspectives an intervention can be called efficient when an additional resource input or higher cost are required to achieve a better outcome with a higher overcompensating benefit therefore even those interventions which are more expensive than established alternatives but which exhibit higher performance of medical tests in terms of predictive value greater effectiveness in treatmentsinterventions more safety fewer sideeffects etc may be efficient whereas private accounting is generally limited to factors measurable in monetary terms classical economic analysis extends the examination to qualitative and intangible costs and consequences it explicitly attempts to measure factors which are difficult to evaluate monetarily statements regarding the relative economic efficiency of intervention strategies compared require an examination of the entire spectrum of costs and consequences of interventions there are different ways to define and to measure benefits some of those methods are based on the principles of welfaretheory some are based on the assumption only that men are deciding in a rational way pragmatic decisionmakers other methods incorporate the preferences of patients into the desirability of outcomes table  gives a short overview the appropriate choice of a method depends not only on the availability of data it rather has to be guided by the purpose of the assessment insofar scientific strictness is the guiding principle the various stakeholders have different views and goals see figure  the usage of the results determines the viewpoint and consequently the number of effects measured and the way how they are valued health economics literature describes three different perspectives an analyst can take when determining the cost and benefits of a health program welfarist extrawelfarist and pragmatic decisionmaker oriented each of those perspectives have specific objectives are based on different principles and assumptions values the costs and benefits differently and therefore demands specific data a welfarist has a strong welfare economics theoretical background he puts considerable emphasis on the valuation from an individual’s viewpoint thus preferring the willingnesstopay method or the method of prevailed preferences to the human capital approach a pure perspective of the health sector budget holder is taken by the extrawelfarist the pragmatist’s view theoretically is the weakest choosing the appropriate evaluation approach not only depends on the problem being addressed but also on the institutional framework and the measurement challenges  within the scope of the operationalization of an evaluation project one must crosscheck the research question with the specific attention and motives of stakeholders and subsequently find the relevant outcome measures and criteria of economic performance and the respective evaluation method finally one has to cover topics like level of evidence needed the economic criteria and the decision rules to be applied  table  study types and goals type of study costminimization analysis costeffectiveness analysis costutility analysis

parameters or general quality of life instruments source wenzel h hysa b economic appraisal as a basis for decision making in health care  effectiveness and efficiency efficiency can be seen as the final stage of a logical process of three steps measuring economic performance from efficacy to effectiveness and finally to efficiency see figure  without efficacy and without effectiveness no efficiency is possible efficacy and effectiveness both describe to what extend a goal could be reached if a goal cannot be reached any resource input is wasted and therefore inefficient historically effectiveness measurements come from engineering science where technical performance had to be measured the result has been typically displayed as physical units per resource used in the health care sector for example cost per saved years of life or prevented cases the measure of effectiveness can be multidimensional this can lead then to challenges when making the comparison with and without a project for that reason analyst always try to have one outcome measure either by finding an algorithm to aggregate the various indicators into one measure or by applying measures that are multidimensional like a quality of life measurement scale costutility analysis cua specifically takes this into consideration  figure  medical and economic benefits from different viewpoints source wenzel presentation at edma meeting in brussels  efficacy is a specific measure of effectiveness used in the health care sector efficacy is the study outcome under ideal ie controlled conditions and is expected to be an unbiased proof that an intervention works it is a “proof of principle” based on randomized clinical trials rct controlling for possible confounders implicates that compliance is higher than in real life and the patients are highly selected exclusion of certain conditions ie multimorbidity age and gender and therefore not representative for a specific target population transferring efficacy data directly to a target population would lead to an overestimation of the effects as a next step one wants to know now how it works under real conditions in a target population this kind of evaluation provides effectiveness data it is the classical area for empirical studies of health services research and public health if efficacy and effectiveness are proven efficiency analysis would be the final step then as efficiency depends on the health care system the viewpoint of the evaluation and therefore on the number of effects and assessed data of efficacy and effectiveness do not necessarily lead to efficient results in summary on can say that efficacy and effectiveness data are prerequisites and in terms of formal logic essential but not sufficient conditions it happens that effective interventions are useful and efficient in one country but not in others one has to be cautious to transfer uncritically data between various countries the study types shown in the table above will deliver different kinds of information that might not be suitable for any research question a costeffectiveness analysis cea will only display relative efficiency ie compare only two alternatives aiming at the same objective therefore many economists express their concerns whether a cea is suitable for comparing across different forms of health care allocative efficiency thus providing technical efficiency only a costbenefit analysis cba displays  absolute efficiency like in a business investment calculation where the return of investment is calculated the valuation of life saves years of life in terms of money has been disputed for many reasons equity issues are seen in way how the valuation of saved cases of different ages are weighted or how life and health will be valued nevertheless there are many ways to carry out a cba the valuation of physical units like saved years of life can be based on willingnesstopay or on the human capital approach with the willingnesstopay approach the preferences of citizens or patients are used to put a monetary value on time from an economic perspective this is the adequate way figure  medical and economic performance from different viewpoints source presentation at edma meeting in brussels  in practice there is much preparatory work required with the human capital approach lifetime is valued based on the earnings of person that are either forgone or could be saved when life is prolonged andor morbidity is prevented it has been a challenge to value lifetime of pensioners housewives and children in an acceptable way in spite of that this approach has some advantages with respect to feasibility availability of data in addition to the question whether a type of valuation is in line with the evaluation goal and the design it is the human capital approach that contributed to the disrepute of economic evaluations and raised ethical questions conclusion in conclusion one can say that the request for efficiency and inherently effectiveness and for equity has the same roots it is scarcity so efficiency and equity are flip sides of a coin equity without efficiency is not feasible and efficiency without taking equity into consideration is unethical there is no universal agreed ethics for objecti  ves of the health care sector but equality of access is consistent with most ethical theories and consistent with efficiency  it preserves consumer sovereignty exercises task  after introductory lectures students will work in small groups divided according to their countries they will be given the case study to discuss the question of equity and effectiveness in a health system this exercise should take  minutes task  for the next exercise they will be grouped in two larger groups the first group will be pro equity oriented and the second group pro efficiency oriented they will participate in debate pro equity vs pro efficiency the aim of the discussion is to explore the possibilities for change and improvement of equity and efficiency in their case study health system the exercise will be concluded with discussion summary given by teacher it is recommended that

regulatory principles in european health systems • be aware of recent challenges and opportunities in front of their health systems • recognize the necessity for investing in health • understand the basic mechanisms of market development in healthcare and its regulation • identify different methods and types of regulation in the healthcare market the authors analyze the basic financial principles and the regulated entrepreneurship in the healthcare systems in europe they point out that the european countries organize manage and finance their health care in different ways thus the health systems vary not only in the financial methods used but also in the payment scheme of the insurance institution and the healthcare providers as well as the ways in which the state regulates the health services provision and the development of market relations in healthcare some of the most uptodate challenges and opportunities in front of european healthcare systems are overviewed an example case

investing in health – an ethical necessity or economic demand health is already widely accepted as a basic human necessity and right the aspiration for good health is natural and leading in almost every human being at the beginning of the st century the world health report  was issued “health systems improving performance” despite the controversial and much discussed analyses and comparisons of different countries’ healthcare systems it draws the attention to the cost of ill health or illness – not only physical and psychological but also social and economic  “… illness itself… can threaten people’s dignity and their ability to control what happens to them… health systems have a responsibility not just to improve people’s health but to protect them against the financial cost of illness…” it stresses on the state’s responsibility for investing in health and preventing economic losses due to unexpected disease the role of health as a driver of economic growth has been recently acknowledged in europe it’s already considered to be of great importance for the commitment of europes governments to make europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge driven economy by   several years ago the commission on macroeconomics and health concluded that ill health was contributing to the low level of economic growth in poor countries the report showed that investment in health interventions would lead to substantial economic growth  despite increasing recognition of the link between health and economic development in lowincome countries the relationship has received attention in rich countries as well  nevertheless reasons for investing in health in rich countries may differ in detail from that in lowincome countries there is considerable and convincing evidence that significant economic benefits can be achieved by improving health not only in developing but also in welldeveloped economies in spite of the remaining evidence gaps policymakers in developed countries should consider investing in health as one of few ways by which to achieve their economic objectives  several mechanisms falling into four main categories could account for the relation between the population health status and national economic growth  − productivity healthier populations tend to have higher labour productivity because their workers are in good physical and mental condition they also suffer fewer lost workdays − education healthier people who live longer have stronger incentives to invest in developing their skills which promotes greater productivity and in turn higher income good health also promotes school attendance and enhances cognitive function − investment in physical capital longer lifeexpectancy creates a need for savings for retirement increased savings lead to increased investment  − “demographic dividend transition from high to low rates of mortality and fertility in many developing countries in recent decades this gradually gives way to an increase in the proportion of the population that is of working age income per capita can rise dramatically if people are engaged into productive employment thus the design of the national healthcare system and the financial resources allocated to its development and improvement appears to be crucial for population health which on its side has a major influence on the economic growth of certain country every health system has developed on its own way influenced by cultural historical social economic and technical factors grounded on this the healthcare in the european countries differs mainly in two aspects  the financing mechanisms types of health provision insurance models payment mechanisms revenue distribution etc  the regulation of the healthcare services and market development public – private balance and level of entrepreneurship regulation basic financial principles and challenges in the european health systems a health system is complex structure consisting of people institutions and organizations which interact to mobilize and allocate resources for prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries this structure is based on certain fundamental pillars  essential elements that enable the healthcare system to function information management human resources and financing  in the present paper we shall discuss only aspects of the forth pillar – healthcare financing the european countries organize govern manage and finance their healthcare systems in different ways but all of them are based on few common principles  universal access to medical care  solidarity in the distribution of resources and expenditures  high standard quality and safety of healthcare services the challenge of healthcare financing is twofold to mobilize sufficient funds for the health system and to apply manage those funds well  mobilizing funds to finance public health interventions is difficult both because health services are becoming more and more costly and because raising revenues in low and middleincome countries is not easy choices of different financing mechanisms also have important implications for that who will bear the costs of health care the population at large may share spending thereby providing effective insurance to those who become ill or it may fall most heavily on the sick ones there are also a number of initiatives to promote health insurance coverage through voluntary schemes strong arguments can be made in favour of pooling the financial risk associated with paying for health care among the widest population possible effectively paying for the health care of the poor and the sick with taxes and premiums paid by those who are healthier and wealthier  there are two main financial sources in healthcare − public state governmental semistate  insurance  mixed − private outofpocket official and unofficial  private insurance  mixed private health insurance exists in a number of countries and is most often used as supplemental or complementary in denmark germany greece and the united kingdom many patients use private health insurance so they can be treated by the physician of their choice or escape waiting in patients’ lists in the public sector the available empirical evidence shows that income is the key parameter in the decision to buy additional health insurance and not health status or “need” high premiums may make it impossible for poor patients to buy private health insurance and this problem is further exacerbated if premiums are riskbased where less healthy individuals who are disproportionately poorer pay more however in most countries due to the fact that insurance is often bought in group settings premiums remain more or less independent of health status and may therefore remain affordable for large groups of the population  the process of financing and provision of health services can be simplified into two interrelated and complementary processes – transfer and exchange − the providers transfer health resources products to the patients customers − the patient’s transfer exchange financial resources towards the providers – directly or through a third party insurer the relation between the financing and the health results outcome can be resumed in figure   figure  influence of healthcare financing on the outcome  demographic change in europe presents further economic budgetary and social challenges in coming decades due to people living longer and a potential drop in the workforce from the falling birth rate while in many ways this can be seen as a triumph for public health it also poses a particular challenge for the health and social  sector predictions are that the ratio of elderly economically inactive people   years to people of working age could more than double between  to  in the european union it is more important than ever that people remain healthy and independent to as late in life as possible so that premature deaths among the middleaged working population are avoided and morbidity is “compressed” towards the end of life as a result of these tendencies in the last decade most of the european health systems especially in welldeveloped market economies are characterized by an increasing financial deficit despite the considerable amount of resources allocated for healthcare the gap between the health expenditure and health resources is increasing due to mostly three main factors  − aging of the population and epidemiological transition to chronic lifelong morbidity − fast development of health science and technology and − incompetent health policy governance and management facing this constant increase in the financial deficit governments worldwide are facing the dilemma increase in the resources revenues or restriction of the expenditures in general there are two mechanisms possible  first option increase in the revenues – insurance contributions copayments fees taxes etc this can eventually lead to decrease in the number of insured people especially in systems with voluntary health insurance second option restrict the resources for medical care this may eventually cause decrease in the quality of health services and in the human capacity in health when taking decision on investing in healthcare and distribution and redistribution of resources and spending we should not forget that the provider of health services is mainly aiming at profit while the user patient  customer is orientated towards higher utility effective care  the goal of all european countries is achieving balance between profit and utility fig  figure  balance between profit and utility in the health sector   in general the challenges for the european health systems can be summarized as follows  the costs of medical care increasing more than costs in other social and economic sectors  scientific innovations information communication diagnostic and treatment technologies etc  excessive demand of health services by the population − increased life expectancy and aging − increased awareness education expectations − increased income and financial stability of the population  free market and competition is not a reasonable option for a healthcare system  difficulties in maintaining solidarity principle and universal access to healthcare  difficulties in maintaining high quality and safety of health services  free movement of goods services people and capital in the eu regulation entrepreneurship and market development in healthcare „if it moves tax it if it still moves regulate it if it stops moving subsidize it“ ronald reagan the s witnessed a dramatic upsurge in the scale character and calibre of entrepreneurial initiatives within european health care systems  a wide variety of marketinspired efforts to stimulate service innovation including increased quality and greater efficiency have been launched in both public and notforprofit private sectors and in core health service activities as well as in more peripheral supplies and services in practice the last  years have been a period of substantial organizational reconfiguration in the health sector and increased entrepreneurial activity has been at the core of that process of change  entrepreneurial behaviour is perceived to stimulate innovation and initiative the conceptual and practical emphasis on entrepreneurialism can have a positive impact on health systems when the changes undertaken help strengthen the ability of national policymakers to achieve their stated policy objectives  at the organizational level entrepreneurialism seeks to modernize and rationalize organizations to increase their operating efficiency the powerful impetus to innovate generated by entrepreneurialism can have decidedly less positive effects however when it has not been adequately fenced in by effective state regulation entrepreneurs inevitably seek to segment markets so as to exploit profitable niches while publicly accountable regulators try to ensure that the entire market is served efficiently and affordably  health care has a unique character as a social as well as a private good which increases the importance of the regulatory role in the health sector what is obvious from the last decade developments in european health systems is that a substantial volume of new regulation has been generated most european countries established  new types as well as expanded the existing range of what can be termed steerandchannel regulation thus as areas of entrepreneurial activity grew they were accompanied by a parallel growth in related state regulation at present the state is expected to ‘row less but steer more’ its role in driving the health sector forward has to increase in scale scope and sophistication the state’s supervisory responsibilities have evolved to the point that the term ‘stewardship’ has now been applied to its overall policy and management obligations in the health sector  the concept of stewardship obliges the state to steer overall health system activity in an ethically grounded as well as a financially efficient manner regulation as a central instrument of stewardship must from this perspective similarly satisfy these two basic requirements calling for ethical and efficient state behaviour failing to regulate entrepreneurialism adequately in the health sector would be a serious breech of the state’s role as a responsible steward  the mechanisms of regulation despite wideranging definitions and contradictory rationales there is broad agreement about the source and general mechanisms of regulation regarding who regulates we can find national level as well as regional and local levels of administration with the emergence of new paneuropean agencies european union regulation can also be supranational while most regulation in europe is conducted by some form of government department it can be undertaken by independent regulatory agencies or by selfregulatory bodies  regulation to ensure health gain necessarily addresses actors outside as well as inside health care and intersectoral collaboration is a necessary tool for successful regulation the mechanisms of regulation can be grouped into three basic categories tools and strategies which can in turn be combined in various mixes  the major categories are legislation administrative decree and judicial order one for each of the three branches of government legislative executive and judicial each of these three can be generated in many different forms and formats particularly administrative decrees advisory regulations guidelines etc two dimensions of health sector regulation   social and economic policy objectives it is normative and valuedriven in nature concerned with specific policy goals and with the broad public interest which may be different in different countries these broad policies also need to influence government decisions in other sectors such as education transport employment housing and agriculture  these objectives are − equity and justice to provide equitable and needsbased access to health care for the whole population including poor rural elderly disabled and other vulnerable groups − social cohesion to provide health care through a national health care service or to install a social health insurance system − economic efficiency to contain aggregate health expenditures within financially sustainable boundaries − health and safety to protect workers to ensure water and food safety  informed and educated citizens to educate citizens about clinical services pharmaceuticals and healthy behaviour − individual choice to ensure choice of provider and in some cases insurer as much as possible within the limits of the other objectives −  health sector management mechanisms this level is practical and operational and is concerned with the specific regulatory mechanisms through which decisionmakers seek to attain the type of policy objectives set out  these means are largely technical in nature concerning efficient and effective management of both human and material resources − regulating quality and effectiveness assessing costeffectiveness of clinical interventions training health professionals accrediting providers − regulating patient access gatekeeping copayments general practitioner lists rules for subscriber choice among thirdparty payers tax policy tax subsidies − regulating provider behaviour transforming hospitals into public firms regulating capital borrowing by hospitals rationalizing hospital and primary carehome care interactions − regulating payers setting rules for contracting constructing planned markets for hospital services developing prices for publicsector health care services introducing casebased provider payment systems eg diagnosticrelated groups regulating reserve requirements and capital investment patterns of private insurance companies etc − regulating pharmaceuticals generic substitution reference prices profit controls basketbased pricing positive and negative lists − regulating physicians setting salary and reimbursement levels licensing requirements setting malpractice insurance coverage rules of the regulatory road  regulate strategically − regulation is part of strategic planning − regulation is a means rather than an end − regulation should further core social and economic policy objectives − regulation is longterm not shortterm regulate complexly − regulation involves multiple issues simultaneously − regulation can combine mechanisms from competing disciplines − regulation requires an integrated approach that coordinates multiple mechanisms − regulation should fit contingencies of each health system − regulation requires flexible public management no deregulation without reregulation − deregulation requires a new set of regulatory rules − reregulate before you deregulate  trust but verify − regulation requires systematic monitoring and enforcement − selfregulation requires systematic external monitoring enforcement and regulatory approaches in the health sector  regulating capacity many countries have adopted some form of regulation aimed at limiting the capacity of the health system regulating prices regulation can also be aimed at prices in the health system for example by using centrally determined fees or differential payments such as the diagnosis related group drg method government can also use ‘price’ regulation in the health insurance sector by regulating contributions premiums and riskadjustment mechanisms as well as the terms under which such insurance is provided regulating quality government can also regulate the health sector through the collection and dissemination of information on provider performance a different aspect of quality of care that can be regulated is implementation of patients’ rights regulating market structure and levels of service regulation often takes the form of establishing the ‘rules of the game’ for the participants in the health system most prominently this involves establishing conditions for entry into health markets and setting levels of service one method of regulating the incentive to ‘cream skim’ is to offer health insurers per capita payments eg capitation adjusted for the risk of each enrolled citizen the prevalence of such practices depends on the incentive structure offered by government and in particular on the level of actual risksharing on the other hand governments may have less success monitoring socalled ‘quality skimping’ in which chronically ill and elderly patients fail to receive adequate care  regulating entitlements once citizens are covered the entitlements available to them may be subject to government regulation many countries are struggling with the issue of determining a package of health services that sick funds are obliged to provide in addition various supplementary insurance policies may be available for services not covered under national health insurance this raises perplexing problems of differentiating between what is provided and how it is provided under the different schemes this is another example of how difficult it can be to develop and apply regulations aimed at supplementary insurance we can summarize five major forms of regulation found in european countries − decentralization  − − − − compulsory selfregulation accreditation and licensing independent regulatory institutions regulation through intersect oral collaboration who is regulating regulatory organs − parliament − governmental institutions ministry of health national institutes − independent regulatory bodies accreditation audit agencies professional organizations etc − eu structures european commission − courts − selfregulation in terms of the conceptual framework outlined above it could be said that health systems have been moving from control by standardization of professional norms to various forms of commandandcontrol and on to attempts to standardize outputs and evaluate outcomes moving away from commandandcontrol however did not necessarily mean less regulation the evolution of regulation in the health sector therefore is not a matter of a linear progression from one mechanism of control to the next but rather a constant mixing and remixing of regulatory tools that have accumulated throughout the years of a health system’s development  we can also suggest that most european healthcare systems will achieve a slower but steady growth in the number of social entrepreneurs working in the public sector but importing a variety of private sector concepts and incentives policymakers would become more and more comfortable with this situation there should be a noticeable increase in what was termed ‘social entrepreneurialism’  this middle territory between purely bureaucratic public and purely forprofit private may itself blur the publicprivate boundaries by incorporating elements of notforprofit private in partnership with independently managed publicsector organizations in such system the regulatory challenges will be considerable and successful outcomes will depend on the evolution of strict regulatory arrangements one potential regulatory framework that has yet to be adequately explored in the health sector is the application of the notion of independent regulatory agencies  as the overall entrepreneurial level increases within health systems the range scope and capacity of state regulation will have to increase with it the challenge to policymakers will be to concentrate on designing a better framework with which to conduct that supervision the state and the market in european healthcare  the european union analyses regarding the benefit and damage from the free market competition in health care are contradictory  the market competition in health care requires strict regulation through specific legislation  the final goal of the market regulation in healthcare is to assure that every decision and initiative taken is in the public social interest  the mixed publicprivate model of healthcare is evaluated as the most efficient way for reorganization of the european health systems   the future belongs to a marketorientated patientcentred healthcare system  one of the most effective ways to achieve better health for the whole population in conditions of restricted resource is through health promotion and preventive medicine  the longterm experiences of certain countries as well as international analyses suggest that the choice for a health insurance model should be made on − the level of economic development of the country − the level of the social moral values and ethics − the level of political responsibility to health issues − the tested models in international experiences case study healthcare financing and reforms in bulgaria on the way to a modern marketorientated health system general introduction and context in the period since  the countries of southeastern europe have invested significant efforts in the pursuit of wideranging reform of their health sectors addressing issues of financing organization and management of health care services these efforts were a reaction to the inadequacies of the health systems inherited from the communist era the pressures arising from political and economic transition a collapse in the funding available for health care and to differing degrees the effects of wars conflicts and economic sanctions while the countries have followed different trajectories their overall aims in the health sector have often been similar in the process of reform with the exception of the former yugoslavia all the see countries followed the semashko model of health care provision developed in the ussr in the s till the s in the s health funding collapsed in all countries of the region  transition in health financing and system in bulgaria during the process of reform  in general the health care reforms in bulgaria were aimed at changing the health system financing methods in order to ensure sufficient and sustainable health care budget guarantee equity in the public health sector enhance efficiency and quality of services reorganize primary health care and rationalize outpatient and inpatient facilities the health reform remained on the periphery of public sector reform until the late s and little changed until  the health insurance system was introduced in  when the health insurance act was adopted introducing compulsory and voluntary health insurance the contributions were set at  of an individual’s income shared between the employer and employee at a ratio of  the state and the municipalities cover the contributions of pensioners children and lowincome groups the health insurance act defines direct patient copayments for using health care services covered by the basic benefits package since  patients pay  of the minimum monthly salary for each outpatient visit and  of the minimum monthly salary per day of hospitalization up to  beddays per year the  compulsory health insurance system guarantees a basic benefits package of health care services to the insured population however this package is not clearly specified which creates financial burden for the population health care financing was separated from health care provision and contractbased relations were established private practice was legalized in  public and private health care facilities were reorganized financial reforms were followed by change in the payments to hospital sector providers and the introduction of a scheme based on performance and cases – “clinical pathways” with a single flat rate per diagnosis the change in hospital financing was supposed to enhance the competition between the health care providers and increase the quality of services the primary care and gps as gatekeepers to specialized care were introduced allowing costcontainment but also opening a discussion of whether such policies would hinder the free provision and access to health care total health expenditure has been increasing since  it accounted for  of gdp in  ie it was higher than the  average of the eu countries  however there was a general decline in levels of public health expenditure accompanied by a relative increase in private sources from  in  to  of total health financing in   contributionbased financing of health care has not been able to provide enough funding for the system the fact that  million people do not pay their contributions results less resources for the nhif in order to cope with these difficulties the contribution rate is planned to be increased and the ratio of employer employee contributions is intended to reach  by  in order to provide disincentives for the employer to escape paying contributions conceal the real income of employees or not to hire new workers however at the same time the planned initiative led to a discussion of whether this might create additional financial burden for the population and public dissatisfaction with the health system  the way forward – opportunities to improve the financing of bulgarian healthcare system and open a way to more efficient publicprivate mix system the analysis of the bulgarian healthcare financial status reveals chronic lack of resources for health and considerable number of cases of ineffective and inexpedient management of the spent financial resources considering the restricted state budget as well as the nhif incapacity to provide enough finances for the routine activities of the healthcare system a multifaceted strategy has to be accepted in order to solve the problems of the bulgarian healthcare it needs to find new sources and approaches for collecting the necessary funds for healthcare the specific circumstances in bulgaria require the introduction of an uptodate and efficient healthcare financing which would be able to provide balance and stability in the system at the present situation some of the most important prerequisites for this are   surrounded by a constantly changing social political and economic environment the bulgarian people are trying to protect themselves and their families considering health protection on first place  in correspondence to the widely discussed and already implemented in many european countries theory of human capital the working force with higher social and health status has higher productivity  every company and organization would logically prefer to direct certain amount of money for the health of its employees instead of compulsory paying these  amounts as taxes to the state this payment could be part of the collective labour agreement which requires respective changes in the taxation legislation system  the policy of the ministry of health for savings at all costs in the medical establishments is equalizing the economic effectiveness with the medical effectiveness which is unfavourable for the patient in this case the patient should pay the difference which leads to decrease in the formal income of the medical staff basic principles of the suggested approach      defining a basic package of health services obligatory covered by the nhif free choice of health services and benefits for the population free choice of health insurance fund for supplementary health insurance financing of the primary health care based on the number of actually registered insured and for services done  free liberal hospital prices the fees should be officially announced by the hospital board the part covered by the nhif basic package should be indicated as well as the amount of the additional payment the prices vary in certain limits set by the professional organizations and the state for every year  free choice of medical establishment by the patient on the basis of quality and price  regulation of the hospital capacity in response to the health services requirement  pluralism in the options for and ratio publicprivate mix formulated in the health strategy of the ministry of health as well as by the market necessities  implementation of drg financing system in the hospitals aiming at provision of real funds for real expenses  competition among the different medical establishments basic concept of the financial model  the model foresees the increase of the health insurance contribution through implementation of an elaborated threepillar model as follows − mandatory basic health insurance provided by the nhif as existing at present − mandatory supplementary health insurance covering the socalled “extended package” of health services and benefits provided by the nhif or another licensed hif − voluntary health insurance covering the “vip package” of health services and benefits conclusion the chance for bulgaria is to implement a specific for the country health insurance model in which its own experience as well as that of other european countries has been integrated the further reforms in the health system should be taken with longterm responsibility by the decisionmakers based on clear evidence multisectoral and international consultations and wide public debate  exercises task  the students divided in groups of  to  are asked to make comparison between the healthcare systems and their financing between two different european countries the comparison is presented according to several indicators criteria in the form of power point presentation a discussion is opened afterwards by doing so it is possible to distinguish common challenges for the future as well as areas where a greater effort needs to be made in some countries of the region than in others task  the students should make a swot analysis of their own country’s healthcare system and propose a possible action plan for improvement especially in economic terms task  the students are asked to search through recommended readings and internet for different sustainable possibilities for private entrepreneurship in their own healthcare system a

theoretical background the field of public health has a distinctly uncoordinated terminology the reason for this is that terms are taken over from different other scientific fields or are created according to historical needs and circumstances in different countries a local jargon is frequently used that is why the understanding of meanings and coordination of terminology is one of the first tasks in the public health course understanding of terms will not come from learning by heart their definitions but from analysis of their meanings in meaningful messages and understanding of their origin and destiny like other words scientific and technical terms are living and changing in spite of strict definitions it is helpful to find a responding word in student mother tongue but do not be disappointed if that would be hard or impossible during the studies students will gradually discuss terms as they come so that at the end the course students should complete the vocabulary exercise

“administration” point of consideration the terms “management” and “administration” are often used with the same meaning they are indeed to a certain degree interchangeable however because of different traditions in countries we might even not be aware of different connotations they have for us the word administration comes from the latin word administrare meaning to help management comes from the english word to manage for some people it would be very difficult even to imagine the differences between two terms in some countries two terms would be used in opposite direction if one reads some books and articles it could be found that in different historical periods one or the other term was more fashionable the same is true for different countries and cultural settings task for students imagine that you are coming into an office building where you find two doors one has the label administration and the other management answer the following questions • what do you expect behind each of these doors  • behind which door do you expect to find people working on a higher hierarchical level  each member of the group answers the given questions separately  discuss your answers in small group explaining similarities and differences  compare your findings with descriptive definitions printed in annex  report shortly in plenary on findings and proposals for utilization

care and health care management terms compiled by laura larsson annex this glossary should be distributed to students at the last part of the second task it includes some of terms often used in the public health courses the other terms could be finding throughout of this book and in other publications administration means control or direction of affairs especially putting something into operation by someone with official power to do so it implies the use of formal and hierarchical lines and procedures it tends to follow inflexible rules and regulations traditionally it reflects functioning of the public sector institutions sometimes it is used for government services and government itself management means using resources of all kinds  m  men  money  materials so that they jointly as a system reach given objectives and produce attainable results management is following flexible and dynamic procedures management is specially used for work in business and with money but it means also skilful dealing with other persons it has a positive connotation so that managing problems or difficulties means their successful solution traditionally it is connected with business and industrial enterprises sometimes it is used to describe the people who are in charge or a governing body of a firm  organization or organization is a social arrangement which pursues collective goals which controls its own performance and which has a boundary separating it from its environment the word itself is derived from the greek word ὄργανον organon meaning tool the term is used in both daily and scientific english in multiple ways in the social sciences organizations are studied by researchers from several disciplines the most common of which are sociology economics political science psychology management and organizational communication the broad area is commonly referred to as organizational studies organizational behaviour or organization analysis therefore a number of different theories and perspectives exist some of which are compatible and others that are competing − organization – processrelated an entity is being reorganized organization as task or action − organization – functional organization as a function of how entities like businesses or state authorities are used organization as a permanent structure − organization – institutional an entity is an organization organization as an actual purposeful structure within a social context planning in organizations and public policy is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan and the psychological process of thinking about the activities required to create a desired future on some scale as such it is a fundamental property of intelligent behaviour this thought process is essential to the creation and refinement of a plan or integration of it with other plans that is it combines forecasting of developments with the preparation of scenarios of how to react to them the term is also used to describe the formal procedures used in such an endeavour such as the creation of documents diagrams or meetings to discuss the important issues to be addressed the objectives to be met and the strategy to be followed beyond this planning has a different meaning depending on the political or economic context in which it is used the circumstances in which we assume that future activities will be performed are determining feasibility of our plans feasibility has the same meaning as possibility a plan is feasible when we have the power and resources to implement it to make it possible the examination of feasibility is done in a systematic way scrutinizing all possible obstacles and constraints in the described interplay the planner has an opportunity to design many optional solutions strategies what gives him a chance to choose the best of them or combine them in an acceptable way designing of optimal alternative strategies is the challenging part of planning in stimulating that process different techniques have been recommended plan of action is formulation of action to be taken by different subjects master plan of action is formulation of actions needed to fulfil results of broad programming and the operative plan of action is the same for detailed programming  goal is the most general not constrained by time and existing resources rather descriptive than quantified not necessarily attainable but an ultimate desired state expected as a result of a policy or broad programming examples increase regular exercise among older adults ensure all children have access to health care eliminate secondhand smoke in public places objective is the intermediate specified in time usually measurable and attainable endresult expected of broad or detailed programming examples by  increase the use of safety belts and child restraints to at least  of motor vehicle occupants baseline  in  to reduce breast cancer mortality by   years after start of the screening program target the desired end point amount of change reflected by a number or percentage is the most specific measurable with precision in short term periods useful as an indicator for monitoring the detailed program achievements they may be used in different horizons of time as milestones along the way toward an objective obstacle is a created difficulty preventing the planned activity it is mostly created by an opposing interest group and often is an expression of political conflicts or tensions constrain is a set of limits due to economic social administrative professional and cultural conditions programming is translation of health policy goals and objectives into strategies and targets to be implemented in practice it could be divided into broad and detailed programming − broad programming can be described as translation of health policies into strategies for achieving clearly stated objectives − detailed programming is conversion of strategies into technology manpower infrastructure financial resources and time required to implement program system analisys is a systematic examination of a system situation problem in which each step is made as explicit as possible the steps are − listing all elements which can be related to the system or its environment − defining goals and objectives of the system identifying also their hierarchy and the most important objective in an observed situation according to the purpose of the analysis − choosing elements which will be considered as the proper system bounding or bordering the systemand others which will be regarded as environment according to defined goals and objectives − describing and examining elements and their relations − generating optional solutions alternatives by manipulating elements and relations to fit better the objectives of the system or to find solutions for identified problems − comparing and evaluating different alternatives and modelling a complex new system  health policy has different meanings a statement of a decision regarding a goal in health care and a plan for achieving that goal eg to prevent an epidemic a program for inoculating a population is developed and implemented  a field of study and practice in which the priorities and values underlying health resource allocation are determined a policy is a deliberate plan of action to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes the term may apply to government private sector organizations and groups and individuals presidential executive orders corporate privacy policies and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy policy differs from rules or law while law can compel or prohibit behaviours eg a law requiring the payment of taxes on income policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have policies can be understood as political management

health care is a set of measures goods and services designed to promote health including “preventive curative and palliative interventions whether directed to individuals or to populations”  in order to maximize effects and minimize cost of applied measures health care should be planned the planning process includes several steps making a cycle the cycle is known as management cycle or cycle of organization and management the health care planning cycle could be divided into different number of steps or elements depending on the level on which the health care is organized here are presented four main steps for the illustration of the management cycle fig  planning evaluation organization implementation fig  four main elements of the management cycle in each step there are several functions and the cycle can be divided into more elements each step has specific characteristic and tasks of those involved in the step of the cycle in different parts of the cycle different actors are involved elements of the cycle followed each other some tasks are common for two or more cycles and some are overlapping what makes the health care system very complex planning although in the reality at one moment the planning cycle could be in the different steps for the purpose of the training we will start with planning step  in this first steps the main task is setting aims defining the goals identification of health problems select priorities among them and choose the strategic course of interventions this is the task of health policy and the process is usually done on country or province level this step of the cycle is based on the careful analysis of present health situation on health situation assessment which could be also a separate step in the cycle good and comprehensive diagnosis will lead to effective and efficient intervention in this part of the political process the economic possibilities and constrains should be analyzed political interest of different social and professional groups taken into account feasibility of health care services calculated and other elements must be analyzed and taken into consideration this political process is responsibility of representative andor political bodies parliament government political parties health professional organizations or their representatives are usually involved chambers association of health workers etc from technical point of view the outcome of this part of the cycle should be a set of indicators and milestones to be reached in certain period of time shortterm middleterm or longterm period the indicators are set up mostly as aims and goals for the region state or larger region for longer period of time while objectives and targets are set up for smaller areas and shorter period of time it is important to set up the level of indicators which are realistic and reachable in defined period of time to prevent social disappointment in the future when planning time will pass to come to the reachable and realistic level of health indicators it is recommended to analyze the situation in neighbouring countries and countries with similar economic and social situation besides the set of health indicators in this part of the cycle it should be also defined the main strategy eg support the primary health care introduction of drg system implementation of screening programs for certain diseases share of gdp for health etc involvement of citizens in decision making process and other important issues in this step of the cycle all actors should understand their role and responsibility should be familiar with the planning process and work together with all political actors public health professionals should explain and inform them and not take their role in defining aims and goals instead of them ones health policy is defined the health managers are responsible for reaching them through the next steps organization implementation and evaluation usually on a lower level of the country organizational structure district county or municipality any health planner faced with the task of formulating long term goals objectives and setting targets needs some assessment of the present situation some description of the point he is to regard as starting point and some knowledge of the processes which have led to the present situation the planning and programming is a part of the management circle dealing with arrangement for carrying out some future activity from the point of management it is an unavoidable and everywhere existing part of the managerial process often we are not conscious of it as in planning some routine everyday activities on the other side it is a major formal procedure involving many people to work together and even prescribed by laws and regulations  the meaning of words planning and programming is practically the same and used interchangeably however to a certain extent there is a different connotation the word programming is coming to us from a greek word and is more underlining contents and goals of future activities the word planning is originally a french word and is underlining different arrangements of resources time etc necessary for implementation of future activities considering hierarchy of these terms in technical jargons one will find that the word program is used to define the goals and orientation defined at the highest level based on what plans are designed there is for instance program of a political party of a president or prime minister that program will be later elaborated into plans some groups of experts might feel that planning is indicating a higher level than programming because usually the state plans are further elaborated into programs of different organizations and institutions actually both groups are right to avoid misunderstandings in the national managerial process the who escaped to use both terms and preference was given to programming the programming could be split in the three subprocesses the broad programming detailed programming and plan of action these words distinguish also three phases in the process of planning one has to differentiate  choosing and defining objectives along with the given policies and strategies the closest is the word programming or broad programming  arranging ways and means of activities to reach objectives and targets under given conditions the closest are the words planning or detailed programming  detailing and scheduling of activities plan of action broad programming can be described as translation of health policies into strategies for achieving clearly stated objectives detailed programming is conversion of strategies into technology manpower infrastructure financial resources and time required to implement programs plan of action is formulation of lines of action to be taken by different subjects the desired endstates outcomes are defined as goals objectives and targets goal is the most general not constrained by time and existing resources rather descriptive than quantified not necessarily attainable but an ultimate desired state expected as a result of a policy or broad programming objective is the intermediate specified in time usually measurable and attainable endresult expected of broad or detailed programming target is the most specific measurable with precision in short term periods useful as an indicator for monitoring the detailed program achievements they may be used in different horizons of time as milestones along the way toward an objective the planningprogramming process varies according to circumstances in which it is carried out so that several classifications are possible among the most important are classifications by subjects who perform planning − central planningprogramming − decentralized planningprogramming − participatory planningprogramming − convergent planningprogramming  period for which it is envisaged horizon − longterm or perspective  years − mediumterm or strategic  years − shortterm or tactic or operative  years basic orientation in resource allocation − input planning oriented towards existing resources − impact planning oriented toward endresults − output planning oriented toward processes eg work of health services there are numerous interrelations and combinations of different types of planningprogramming for instance the central national plans tend to be longterm or at least strategic they are also more oriented to impact and development of inputs than to outputs according to circumstances the middlelevel managers perform planning programming in a special way differently from national as well as grassroot managers specific characteristics of middlelevel regional district planningprogramming specific characteristics of planning the middle level are − shortterm horizon − input resource orientation − intuitive solutions of complex problems − flexibility − detailed planning − stress on implementation − community participation − reserve for interventions in unpredictable crises it depends on the sociopolitical situation and administrative arrangements in each particular place how many decisions and in which areas are given to the middlelevel management in a decentralized system there will be more freedom and that will be reflected in deciding on targets and allocation of resources in a centralized system the planning would cover mostly detail scheduling of activities and distribution of tasks and duties however in both situations the result of planning is formulated as plan of action and has the same elements the format of the plan of action has  elements the format is usually prescribed by rules and regulations but essentially they include always the same elements  objectives and targets  covered population  legal and administrative requirements  specification of activities to be performed  timetable for their implementation  budget  manpower incl recruitment training management  constructions transport equipment supplies logistics  evaluation and monitoring   information support the effective planning is negatively influenced by obstacles and constraints obstacle is a created difficulty preventing the planned activity it is mostly created by an opposing interest group and often is an expression of political conflicts or tensions constraint is a set of limits due to economic social administrative professional and cultural conditions they are common in all levels of management but the following are quite typical for middlelevel planning either because of imposed limitations or poor knowledge and motivation of local planners − poor data analysis − priority given to centrally planned vertical services − orientation to services and not to communities − limited powers in allocation of resources − competition or poor cooperation with other sectors − strong influence of “local authorities” − limited influence on infrastructure training logistics etc the circumstances in which we assume that future activities will be performed are determining feasibility of our plans feasibility has the same meaning as possibility a plan is feasible when we have the power and resources to implement it to make it possible the examination of feasibility is done in a systematic way scrutinizing all possible obstacles and constraints priority setting priority setting means the different problems are listed according to priority it is an important task as not all problems can be attacked simultaneously the setting of priorities requires the planner to formulate the criteria own wishes to use when choosing priorities very elaborate lists of criteria do exist but each planner does well to establish his own criteria however some criteria often used are − the size of the problem in terms of people affected by the problem − the severity of the problem how serious is the problem affecting people − the interlinkage of the problem with other problems what are the chances that attacking that problem will also influence and diminish other problems − the costeffectiveness of the measures likely to attack the problem − the technical feasibility of attacking the problem − the trend in the size of the problem is it an increasing problem or a problem which is already on its way to diminish by itself when all criteria have been chosen the planner has to decide for himself whether he considers all his criteria equally important or not in other words he has to give relative weight to his criteria only after this weighing has been done eg with the aid of a simple numerical scale ranging from one to three or by expressing it in  the rating of the problems again by putting them in a scale according to the different criteria can be undertaken the process of rating the problems in order of overall priority finally gives the planner the final picture the comprehensive diagnosis  although this numerical rating is a helpful tool for the planner he is advised to check with his own feelings whether after the whole process the outcome is consistent with his intuition just as in clinical medicine the more comprehensive the diagnosis can be established the more it will be possible to realize an effective and causal therapy treating hypertension with drugs lowering the blood pressure is not as effective and causal as combining this with reducing the patients overweight changing his diet and trying to diminish the stress in his life in health planning this is even more so the processes and factors linked to health are complex the time spans during which decisions have their consequences are long and usually a considerable number of people are affected by the decisions and significant amounts of resources are involved a wrong or superficial “symptom diagnosis” like “a shortage of hospital beds” can divert and mislead the planner from the real underlying causes and withdraw valuable resources from essential causal measures attacking the roots of the problem like preventing diseases or treating these at earlier stages yet unfortunately often health planners even when they know the comprehensive diagnosis must content themselves with symptomatic measures because the measures necessary to eliminate the underlying causes are beyond their direct control even in these cases however knowledge of the comprehensive diagnosis is essential for the health planner it enables him to proportionate his symptomatic measures and to enter the dialogue with those whose influence is closer to the roots of the problem diagnosis without consequences is useless and costly consuming time and resources however both in clinical and in administrative health work an unproportionally big effort is often spent in diagnostic procedures without adequate influence in practice either the diagnosis is “overdone” more examinations data etc than necessary for decision or the proposed solutions are not relevant because available resources and other general conditions do not permit their application because of that during the diagnostic procedure the probable outcomes and consecutive interventions have to be envisaged tentative diagnosis alternative solution hypotheses in real life an inseparable part of diagnostic thinking is what one has to do later how to help a patient or which strategy to choose in controlling an epidemic contemporary research has shown that a manager similarly to a doctor or other health worker will come to better diagnosis if − heshe during examination keeps in mind the wider range of possible measures to be taken after diagnosis − heshe is critically analyzing existing opportunities and constraints feasibility − heshe is flexible to play with concepts relations and combinations of facts even if it appears strange unusual and “lateral” a good manager needs an openness “brainstorming” initiative and creativeness together with a strict critical and logical internal evaluation of facts a combination of imagination and realistic experiences initiative and hierarchical discipline together with a clear vision of goals  intervention intervention means interfering with the usual “natural” course of events often the diagnostic process by itself makes the first part of intervention for instance an epidemiological survey is at the same time a health education activity intervention means a change how intensive and deep that change will be is determined by the intervention model we have to use listing of all possible interventions or actions which can help in counteracting each of the problems listed in earlier step it is useful to indicate also at which level each action should be undertaken national provincial or local level selection of those interventions which are likely to have influence on as many problems as possible and which can be considered as technically feasible these can be regarded as the “building blocs” for the strategy all selected interventions are now grouped in a logical timescale in which levels and “critical pathways” are indicated critical pathways indicate the sequence of different interventions which can only be realized in one given order for this purpose it can be used scheduling and network planning techniques such as gantt chart pert cpm and others organization in this part of management cycle the manager has to deals with an organization as a process and an organization as a structure the organization as a process is the arrangement of parts which form an effective whole the organization as a structure is a group of people with a special purpose eg a unit of health services an institution the organization may be regarded as an open dynamic sociotechnical system it is a dialectical relation of a given technology and social aspects of its application ie work connected with that technology division of labour relations toward means of production interpersonal and group relations because of that the organizations of the health units with different types of technology have different work relations and different organizational problems for instance a big hospital in comparison with a health centre the organization may also be regarded as having different characteristics as the consequence of size level of complexity and phase of development macroorganization will deals with big overall systems and microorganization with small units eg a rural hospital or a district health centre in everyday life expressions such as “young organization” “traditional organization” “handicapped organization” etc are used and they indicate the lively social dynamics of organizations organizing implies the ability to coordinate activities necessary for implementation in such a way that − the right things are done − in the right place − at the right time − in the right way and − by the right people to reach that a manager has to observe   objectives  each group of tasks in an organization must have an objective that contributes to the main objectives of the organization the system or the program  definition of tasks  each group and individual must have clearly defined tasks so that everyone knows exactly his tasks and duties  command  each group must have one person in charge and all concerned must know who this person is there are a several important rules related to command − responsibility  the person in charge is responsible for the performance of the people in his group − authority  each person in charge of a group must have authority equal to his responsibility − span of control  no person in charge of a group should be expected to control more people than his knowledge time energy and effectiveness permit    balance  the person in charge of several groups must see that the groups interests opportunities and conditions of work are in balance evaluation evaluation could be simply defined as “finding out the value of something” the same meaning has the terms to assess or to appraise evaluation is a systematic process of assessing the extent to which an action achieved its objectives andor to which extent it is regarded as beneficial this broad definition includes two possible types of evaluation the one in which the objectives are not well specified in advance close to general goals or aims and the second in which objectives are predetermined explicitly close to targets in both situations the information generated by evaluation is serving as a feedback to planners and concerned about future activities the evaluation process consists of  comparing the objectives and outcomes of activities and  adding a value judgment to obtained results the value judgment is based on objective findings but also takes into account complex set of factors influencing results consider marginal opportunities and benefits and apply the value system of those who perform evaluation in this way evaluation is a combination of objective finding and subjective moral political interpretation obviously it is most important who is doing evaluation and why for instance if evaluation of health services is done only by health administration the result may differ from those by users the second important consequence is that the process is not completely “objective” and “scientific” as it is usually suggested in managerial text books the comparisons of predetermined objectives and obtained results may be considered as objective but it cannot cover the whole range of evaluation in health care the question is who is predetermining the objectives and how one is judging the  difference between findings and objectives for instance the budget for operation of primary health care units in a district was not completely used and  of “savings” are accounted there are several possibilities in evaluation of that finding  it may be regarded as very positive eg by district health authorities because the savings are considered as results of better organization of work  the results could be judged as negative again by higher health authorities because “savings” are result of acceptable but incomplete fulfilment of requirements  the results may be regarded as negative eg by users because the work of health units being poor quality and “cheap” below of expectations  it could be regarded as positive eg by local health workers because health outcomes measured as change in infant mortality rates shows improvements the question is which position we will take in evaluation all may be right to a certain extent in principle the right decision should be based on understanding the main purpose of evaluation ie the future improvements of health care evaluation should be a continuous process but for practical reasons it has to be summarized and reported at given times and specified intervals coinciding with data collection routine preparation of new plans new budgeting periods and similar for narrow operations and programs it will be more frequent weekly or monthly for national policy formulation every  years in routine activities the evaluation has to be done in specified regular intervals as part of monitoring activities besides it is recommendable from time to time to have a review a comprehensive “in dept” evaluation in special project and when new activities are introduced the evaluation should be applied when plan is completed preliminary evaluation based on a theoretical consideration of probable outcomes during the implementation process or formative evaluation and at the end final or outcome evaluation the comparison of findings is most important part and basis for value judgments in most cases it will be the comparison with expected planned and predetermined targets in some cases and also as a useful addition two further types of comparisons are useful the beforeafter comparison comparison with findings obtained last time eg last year or obtained before start of activities we would like to evaluate and the comparison with other areas where similar activities have been undertaken the measures used in evaluation are based on relation between main elements of the working process the main elements are needs input process output and outcome in process of health services it is particularly important not to mix output and outcome output is product in terms of services supplies etc and outcome is effect or result of these services the most frequently measures used in evaluation specified as indicators could be grouped in the following groups described the specific results of health services relevance is assessed by relating needs and outcomes it should answer the question does the working process satisfy the needs relevance is one of the most important indicators the very basic one because if health services not satisfying real needs all other measures are irrelevant or change their meaning for instance if we evaluate some laboratory procedures we may come to conclusion that they are effective  and cheap in identifying a disease eg malaria but this is worthless and even very costly if applied in situation with no malaria relevance is most important in evaluation the costly hightech procedures but it is rarely done effectiveness effectiveness impact objective effectiveness input process output outcome performance efficiency figure  relations between main elements of the health care process adapted to wollas adequacy relates output of services with needs the relation can be observed in terms of type kind and quality appropriateness and in terms of quality sufficiency the indicator should answer z the question if there are right and sufficient services provided to satisfy needs for instance the adequate immunization would mean that sufficient number of children eg  where immunized in an appropriate way with fully valid vaccines in this case even three factors are important quality quality of work quality of vaccine coverage is measuring population covered by services and can be regarded as a special case of adequacy it is a complex measure close to sufficiency needs are expressed as number of people who need andor demand different services formal coverage or who actually utilize services actual coverage coverage may be expressed in terms of total population population having particular risks certain population groups social professional etc or defined territory people who live in defined territory while coverage is a measure of formal nature in real life situation a indicators would demonstrate what extent to which coverage is transformed into utilization is accessibility is answering to the question to which extent and which services can be physically reached by people the reason why people do not use services might be that services do not exist availability among barriers of different kinds one most important is that people may not utilize available services because they are too costly affordability  effectiveness is measuring the desired effect of services relating output and outcome elements of the working process it is answering the question providing these services how much will be reached of the desired health effects for instance by finishing the program of health education on health diet how much will be changed regarding dieting and nutrition of the community after screening a population for cancer how many new case will be discover in right time for treatment the effectiveness has usually a technical connotation how effective are drugs or diagnostic procedures and tools but it can also be used in a managerial meaning when we speak about organization for instance how effective is a hospital or health centre or epidemiological services health needs efficiency process productivity money manpower facilities technology •methods •equipment efficacy relevance suficiency input output coverage demand utilization effectiveness amount quality accessability supply outcome figure  measures for evaluation in the health care process special case of effectiveness is efficacy which is defined as effectiveness in real life situation for instance if a drug is very effective under experimental conditions it does not mean that it will be as effective when applied in a rural hospital or at home or a screening procedure applied in different population groups will not give the same effect  efficiency is related to use of resources and the term has primarily a managerial connotation it has to answer the question how much of resources have to be used to reach the planned level of effectiveness it relates input to output efficiency is the major managerial tool it includes all types of resources like financial human technical and also time for instance we will tell that a service is more efficient either if less financial or other material resources are spent or the work is done in less time or by less people efficiency is the starting point to be specified as financial organizational or other efficiency however often all different factors are translated into financial terms and expressed as cost there are two additional indicators of general nature on relating the observed activity working process as the whole in the relation to time and to the environment  impact is measuring the effect of evaluated activities on broader issues the environment on the overall health development health status of the whole community and on related social and economic productivity demographic changes etc  progress is an indicator used for assessing development of project or services in relation to time the question is what are the changes occurring during the last year in terms of meeting project deadlines but also other improvements of services coverage etc it is an important measure of overall development in time and not only control of planned schedule the evaluation is part of the control and administrative procedures but it has to become also a contribution to technical improvements and social changes this will be achieved only when the comprehensive evaluation is done in a participatory way including into the process users people and communities and on the other side health workers whose work is evaluated technical experts and professionals the evaluation has an impact on those whose work is evaluated which is not always what was intended insisting on utilization of formal and objective data will pretty soon produce expected type of report regardless what is happening in real practice data have to be used only after double checking and careful interpretation exercises task  selection of goals objectives and targets from who or other data base select several indicators which will respond to goal objective and target find

healthcare provider perspective economic perspective after completing this module students should be familiar with concept of “health needs” from public health perspective the concept of “health needs” is one of key concepts in public health from the public health standpoint the most important perspective on this concept is the perspective of a population or an individual respectively but along this perspective there exist several other perspectives which can be to the certain extent similar but also could be also very different all this enters an enormous confusion in its understanding and consecutively this concept seems rather elusive this confusion originates from the fact that the concept of “health needs” is very difficult to define exactly like it is also very difficult to define exactly the concept of “health itself” since both concepts are extremely complex entities the module is trying to enlighten some problems concerning the “health needs” concept” an introductory lecture gives the students first insight in “health needs” concept” the theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study after introductory lectures students first carefully read the recommended readings afterwards they discuss the characteristics of “health needs” concept” with other students in continuation they need to find the examples from their own experience • work under

theoretical background introduction this module could be rather difficult to understand since it is dealing with philosophical aspects of public health rather than with practical nevertheless for public health students it is extremely important to be familiar with the concept of “health needs” since it is one of key concepts in public health here at the very beginning of this module we should emphasize that there exist several different perspectives on this concept from the public health standpoint the most important perspective on this concept is that of a population or an individual respectively this perspective will be the central under consideration different perspectives on “health needs” concept in introduction we have already emphasized that there exist several different perspectives on the “health needs” concept what enters an enormous confusion in its understanding figure  presents majority of the most important perspectives figure  populationindividual perspective health care providers perspective “health need” concept industryeconomy perspective health care payers perspective politicians perspective figure  different perspectives on “health needs” concept as a consequence this concept seems rather elusive this confusion originates from the fact that the concept of “health needs” is very difficult to define exactly like it is  also very difficult to define exactly the concept of “health itself” since both concepts are extremely complex entities  trying to enlighten “health needs” concept from the public health point of view we meet several terms which are continuously used interchangeably we will try to defineexplain those terms which are most frequently brought into use and place them in different perspectives on this concept as well as their dimensions definitions and explanations of terms central terms in explanation of “health needs” concept two central terms are “health need” and “health care need” but we need to start just from the term “need” need the simplest term “need” is used widely but it can have a variety of meanings in oxford advanced learners dictionary of current english  we could find four meanings of this term  a situation when something is necessary or must be done  a strong feeling that somebody want somebodysomething or must have something  the things that somebody requires in order to live in a comfortable way or achieve what heshe wants  the state of not having enough food money or support all these meanings share the same idea  a need refers to a lack of something health need and health care need in public health the term “need” is used in a context of “health needs” concept the problem is that under this term several meanings could be met these meanings are on one hand closely related while on the other they must be clearly distinguished  “health need” in its basic sense of “health need” the term could be explained in different ways since term “a need” refers to a lack of something the most easily understood explanation in the context of concept of “health needs” could be that “health need” refers to a lack of health another simple explanation is that “health need” is a desire of people to remain healthy  “health need” in a professional medical sense of “health need” health need may be defined also as scientifically biologically epidemiologically etc determined deficiencies in health that call for preventive curative and eventually where appropriate control or eradication measures   “health need” in a sense of “health care need” the “lack of health” from the population or an individual perspective could be perceived as strong enough to be expressed in terms of “health care need” this means that “health care need” could be perceived as “health need” which is strong enough for an individual to seek a help in a health care service  “health need” in an economical sense of “health care need”  in health economics “health need” is defined as the minimum amount of resources required to exhaust an individual’s or a specified population’s capacity to benefit from an intervention   some other important considerations some other important considerations about “health needs” concept are • health need like health is not an absolute concept • there are gradations of health need therefore health needs of a population or of an individual have to be prioritised • health need is a subjective rather than an objective scientific concept • perceptions of need vary depending on the observer • health need is not a scientific judgement and it is not the domain of the medical profession only frequently the term “need” in the context of “health needs” concept is confronted andor interchanged by a term “demand” other important terms demand in oxford advanced learners dictionary of current english  we could find three meanings of the term »demand«  a very firm request for something something that somebody needs  things that somebodysomething makes you do especially things that are difficult make you tired worried etc  the desire or need of customers for goods or services which somebody wants to buy or use health demand and health care demand we could notice that from a semantic point of view the last meaning of the term “demand” is very close to the term “health care need” in fact these two terms could be understood from three perspectives at least  “health care demand” in the sense of “health care need” the term “health demand” is used as a synonym in this context as well in this sense the term “health care demand” or “health demand” respectively could be explained as an attempt by an individual in need to seek health care services help  “health care demand” in the sense of “demand” in economic sense for economists the word “demand” is reserved for the desire for a good or service such as health care in addition to the ability to pay for it according to last  demand for health care services is willingness andor ability to seek use and in some settings pay for services sometimes further subdivided into “expressed demand” equated with “use of health care service” and “potential demand” or “need” this division was proposed by who experts group in    “health demand” in the sense of “demand” in populationindividual sense “health demands” are usually measured in terms of the actual utilisation of health services but consideration must be given to the fact that all felt needs by a population most usually in curative medicine cannot be translated into expressed need or demand for various reasons like absence of accessible health services lack of information lack of confidence low income etc other related terms health care according to a dictionary of epidemiology  health care is defined as service provided to individuals or communities by agents of the health services or professions to promote maintain monitor or restore health health care is not limited to medical care which implies therapeutic action by or under the supervision of a physician the term is sometimes extended to include selfcare health care provider according to a glossary of health care and health care management terms   health care provider is an individual or institution that provides medical services eg a physician hospital laboratory this term should not be confused with an insurance company which provides insurance  health care supply in this place also a term “health care supply” need to be mentioned the three terms being “health care need” “health care demand” and “health care supply” should be clearly distinguished according to stevens health care need is what people might benefit from a health care system health care demand is what people wish to use in a health care system and health care supply is what is actually provided  some expert’sexpert groups’ perceptions of health need concept and classifications in literature we can find perceptions of “health need” concept of different experts or groups of experts and their classifications among them who expert committee on health statistics’ perception and bradshaw’s and kalimo’s perception classification of who expert committee on health statistics a classification of “health need” was proposed by the who expert committee on health statistics in   • perceived need  perceived need is the need for health services experienced by the individual and which heshe is prepared to acknowledge under certain conditions it may exceed the professionally defined need • professionally defined need  professionally defined need is the need for health services recognised by a health professional from the point of view of the benefit obtainable from advice preventive measures management or specific therapy under certain conditions it may exceed the perceived need • scientifically confirmed need  scientifically confirmed need is the need confirmed by objective measures of biological anthropometric or  psychological factors expert opinion or the pas sage of time it is generally considered to correspond to those conditions that can be classified in accordance with the international classification of diseases a classification of “health demand” was proposed by the who expert committee on health statistics in  as well • potential demand  potential demand is the demand for health services corresponding to whichever is the greater of the perceived and professionally defined needs for each particular conditions or for all the conditions affecting a given population • expressed demand  expressed demand is the demand actually made on the health services available to a population it may be greater than the actual utilisation because of the existence of waiting lists limited resources or differences between patient’s perception of their needs and professional’s definition of those needs bradshaw’s classification at about same time bradshaw in sociological sphere presented his classification of needs  this classification could be often met in public health as well he distinguished among four types of needs being normative perceived expressed and comparative • normative need  normative needs are those that agree with norms as defined by health professionals • perceived need  perceived needs are those perceived by individuals depending on health services available • expressed need – perceived needs become expressed needs once articulated • comparative need  generalization of evaluated needs in a population results in comparative needs kalimo’s classification in  kalimo finnish expert for health care systems proposed his perspective on “health needs” concept in fact for health care service need he operationally defined health needs as the difference between observed and ideal levels of health  according to kalimo ill health in the individual can conceptually be understood as a disturbance in one or more subsystems being psychobiological perceptive and social activity as a consequence he distinguished among three types of “health needs”  • medically defined need  when a disturbance is present in the psychobiological subsystem on the basis of clinical evidence • perceived need  when a disturbance is present in the perceptive subsystem on the basis of perceived or subjective evidence • socially determined need  when a disturbance is present in social activity on the basis of behavioural or social evidence  “health needs” concept and public health public health view on the “health needs” concept is or should be comprehensive such a view originate from the fact that public health itself is a knowledge and profession that encompasses knowledge of several other professions and sectors and it is as such multiprofessional and multisectoral and integrate them to credit of people that seek for health thus a public health professional needs to be familiar with different perspectives on this concept to be able one side to confront and on the other to integrate populationindividual health care providers health care payers industryeconomy and politicians perspectives two of the most important perspectives in a context of health are the perspective of lay peoplepopulation and the perspective of health care providers and perspective of health care payers figure  the first are thinking about “health needs” and the others about “health care needs” figure  need in a context of health health need health care need populationindividual perspective health care providerpayer perspective figure  the most important perspectives on “health needs” concept mostly both groups are thinking that they are talking about the same issue but this is in fact far away from the truth as it will be discussed later the “health need” is a multidimensional concept and “health care need” is only one way to be expressed that means that the health need could only partially be fulfilled through health care systems especially those typical for western countries in these countries health care is understood to be mostly provided by medical care the fact is that great deal of health is gained and lost outside of medical care and the underlying determinants of good health are to be found in the environments of everyday life people’s social cultural and economic circumstances and the interaction of lifestyles and behaviour with those circumstances a great deal of “health need” thus cannot be fulfilled through a health care system also inside the group of health care providers and payers there are differences in understanding of the health needs concept for example medical need is mostly defined as medically modifiable morbidity burden while demand for medical services is defined as the request of the citizen this time in the role of patient a »consumer« for medical care services  this definition is primarily related to payer’s perspective in some cases that what is “a need” for one it is “a demand” for the other detailed discussion on this issue is beyond the scope of this module and should be worked out in a separate one  at this point we could simply stop this philosophical debate but in fact it could be continued and additionally made even more complex with including the ethical perspective on the issue this very important perspective is often neglected from the pure industryeconomy stand point where most frequently only the rules of capitalism are those that count but this issue is also beyond the scope of this module like beyond the scope are all more economical considerations of health needs including supply of health care from public health point of view the most important perspective is certainly the perspective of population and the member of a population  the individual thus this perspective will be discussed in more details “health needs” from the populationindividual perspective there exist several dimensions of health need from perspective of populationindividual at least being physical mental social and environmental in the sense of natural physical and biological environment figure  health need of a populationan individual physical mental social environmental figure  some dimensions of health need of a populationan individual the disruption can occur in one or more subsystems at the same time whatever health need dimension is it could be perceived or not figure  when and how the need is perceived depends on different factors • mainly it depends on the amount and intensity of disruption every disease has its natural course and most of them have preclinical phase before it is fully expressed with symptoms if there are no symptoms or symptoms are of low intensity or are not frequent the disruption is not disturbing for an individual as a consequence it is not perceived as a health need • to the certain extent the perception of health need also depends on cultural and normative environment of an individual • today health need perception could be also driven by remedies industry eg pharmaceutical industry using marketing methods to enhance consumption of their products • contemporary information technology eg internet as well could raise the perception of health needs that otherwise would not be perceived  health need of a populationan individual physical mental social unperceived perceived unexpressed environmental expressed figure  perception and expression of health needs from the perspective of a populationan individual if health need is perceived it could be expressed or not figure  if it is expressed this could be in different terms among others in terms of need for professional health care medical care with expression of health needs in terms of health care need it is similar situation as in perception only in this case the cultural and normative environment has bigger influence also social economic and natural environment influence expression of health needs for example if an individual has only moderate perception of health need expression in terms of health care need will probably not occur if the health care provider is far distant or too expensive meeting “health needs” of a populationan individual through health care system if we consider only the physical and mental dimension of a health need which is usually searched for and also at least partially fulfilled in the frame of health care system we could confront the expressed perceived physical or mental health need to a health care need recognized by health care professionals figure  in fact mostly the physical dimension is considered inside health care systems while the mental dimension is mostly not in the first plan  health need of a populationan individual physical mental unperceived perceived unexpressed health care system expressed recognized not recognized health care need figure  expressed health needs confronted with recognized and not recognized health care needs when the health care needs meet the health need of a populationan individual we are talking about met need otherwise the needs are unmet figure  the unmet health need is even greater if we consider that great deal of health need is not generated physically or mentally but also has other dimensions as well eg social and environmental in some problems it also happens that the need is recognized by health professionals but it is not perceived by populationan individual figure  this is the case for example in screenings for diseases with unfavourable outcomes like cancer health needs assessment in public health practice at this place we need to introduce also a concept of “health needs assessment” this is or should be an important task for public health the detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this module an extra module is needed to deal with it so at this place we will consider only very basic views assessment of health needs is not simply a process of listening to patients or relying on personal experience it is a systematic method of identifying unmet health and healthcare needs of a population and making changes to meet these unmet needs it involves an epidemiological and qualitative approach to determining priorities which incorporates clinical and cost effectiveness and patients perspectives this  approach must balance clinical ethical and economic considerations of need that is what should be done what can be done and what can be afforded   health need of a populationan individual physical mental unperceived perceived unexpressed expressed met needs health care system recognized unmet needs not recognized health care need figure  met and unmet health needs of a populationan individual health needs assessment should not just be a method of measuring ill health as this assumes that something can be done to tackle it incorporating the concept of a capacity to benefit introduces the importance of effectiveness of health interventions and attempts to make explicit what benefits are being pursued economists argue that the capacity to benefit is always going to be greater than available resources and that health needs assessment should also incorporate questions of priority setting suggesting that many needs assessments are simply distractions from the difficult decisions of rationing for individual practices and health professionals health needs assessment provides the opportunity for • describing the patterns of disease in the local population and the differences from district regional or national disease patterns • learning more about the needs and priorities of their patients and the local population • highlighting the areas of unmet need and providing a clear set of objectives to work towards to meet these needs • deciding rationally how to use resources to improve their local populations health in the most effective and efficient way • influencing policy interagency collaboration or research and development priorities  in box  questions that should be answers in health needs assessment are presented box  questions to be asked when assessing health needs questions in health needs assessments what is the problem what is the size and nature of the problem what are the current services what do patients want what are the most appropriate and effective clinical and cost solutions what are the resource implications what are the outcomes to evaluate change and the criteria to audit success importantly health needs assessment also provides a method of monitoring and promoting equity in the provision and use of health services and addressing inequalities in health    the importance of assessing health needs rather than reacting to health demands is widely recognised and there are many examples of needs assessment in primary and secondary care there is no easy quickfix recipe for health needs assessment different topics will require different approaches these may involve a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to collect original information or adapting and transferring what is already known or available the stimulus for these assessments is often the personal interest of an individual or the availability of new funding for the development of health services however assessments should also be prompted by the importance of the health problem in terms of frequency impact or cost the occurrence of critical incidents the death of a patient turned away because the intensive care unit is full evidence of effectiveness of an intervention or publication of new research findings about the burden of a disease conclusion from the public health perspective is very important to be aware of different dimensions of health need of a populationan individual and how they could be fulfilled public health’s role is to be advocate in fulfilling population’s health needs if they are legitimate and justified and to prevent fulfilling unjustified health needs especially if their fulfilling would result in cutting down fulfilling other justified health needs at the end we need to emphasize again that health needs are not only what people can benefit from health care system this is health care need but also from wider social and environmental changes in meeting health needs in such a comprehensive meaning health needs assessment is extremely important public health task to be done it involves epidemiological qualitative and comparative methods to describe health problems of a population identify inequalities in health  and access to services and determine priorities for the most effective use of resources case studies to illustrate the theory on health needs we prepared several case studies all of them are virtual and could be only by chance similar to real situations case study  a twentytwo years old student of medicine has got very high temperature accompanied by dry cough he felt so badly that he decided to search for medical care he visited his personal medical doctor who prescribed him antibiotics after pneumonia was diagnosed in this case health need was perceived and expressed in medical terms since student’s condition was evidently a clinically expressed disease which could be treated inside the health care system there was no doubt that his need for medical care was recognized by a medical professional his health need was met case study  a group of people living in a small valley in which different kind of industry is located expressed health need in terms of environmental health when they were told that a waste incineration will take place in one of factories after they tolerated for decades the pollution and degradation of the environment they live in they decided to search for professional help to prevent additional pollution in this case the health need was perceived and expressed but not in terms of medical care it is expressed in terms of public health advocacy since environmental pollution in this valley is evident evidence based public health reaction is justified and steps to prevent further pollution needed case study  a fiftyyear old university professor has strongly perceived physical health need expressed as a need for physical activity he does not feel comfortable if he cannot be physically active at least few times per week he mostly uses spinning combined by mountain climbing in this case the health need is perceived and expressed but not in terms of medical care it is expressed in terms of sports activity which could be fulfilled through using recreational facilities provided by community or selfprovided recreational facilities case study  a new vaccine was launched to the market the studies mostly driven by the producer of the vaccine showed for the time being its probable effectiveness in combating the disease that it is meant for the biggest problem is that the price is rather high to systemize vaccination with this vaccine providing of some other health good would be necessary to cut down since a huge population group needs to be vaccinated by this vaccine additionally the optimal target group is not  clear yet the producers use economic marketing principles to advertise the availability of their product and a group of citizens with a political support triggered a campaign in support of systematization of this vaccination in this case there are a lot of obstacles first the health need perception is mainly artificially driven by producer of the vaccine before its definite effectiveness is evident and before optimal target group is clear second the price of the vaccine is rather high third not advantage of all other available and cheaper measures was used yet exercises task  carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module and recommended readings task  critically discuss the differences between the terms • “need” and “demand” • “health need” and “health care need” • “health care need” and “health care demand” use method of fishbowl task  if yes then try to find out its characteristics if not try to find an example from other countries eg finbalt health monitor surveys task  in a group of three to four students prepare a virtual scenario describing a health need of an individual or of a population group prepare a short presentation for other students the scenario will be a part of the assessment references  asadilari m packham c gray d need for redefining needs

identified drivers for strategic management of health organization • understood how strategic intentions vary by level of health care and stakeholders and • explored the similarities and differences between missions and visions of existing organization raised awareness of macroenvironment change pointed out the necessity for strategic planning and management of a modern health organization the apparent management concern is how to maintain a pace with dynamic environment and innovations and to preserve proactive position economic transition in health systems of south east europe countries acts as driver for strategic respond to imposed changes health organizations do vary by their corporate values and level of their autonomy like entities they have to define their purposes missions visions functional capabilities and unique personalities also as an open system they must relate effectively to its external and internal environment after introductory lectures students will work in small groups up to  members they should be divided according to working place in their countries they will participate in brainstorming technique in order to recognize and to define their health organizational values and purpose then they will discuss the possibilities for change and improvement in their own environment while developing their vision and mission teacher should assist by introducing good examples and by highlighting organizational values finally groups will be asked to present their work and explain their organizational current and future direction teacher should be familiar with examples of different health institutional strategic orientations also teacher should be ready to help students to explore internet sites of various health organizations and their strategic concepts and directions eg httpwwwisquaorgisquapageslinkshtml group presentations and discussions  a health organisation purpose and strategic intent creating vision and mission milena santrić milicević theoretical background the environment of rapid changes calls upon health organizations to respond appropriately to them  while health managers in high developed economies struggle with global trends trying to stabilize their positions on competitive health service markets those in transitional countries and particular in public services seek for opportunities and appropriate means for effective development  in the course of generating insight into how to manage strategic change and get forward to the goals two standpoints appeared interesting first is the ohmaes formula for success that comprise knowledge of organizational boundaries three r reality readiness and resources of the organization  the second is the pettigrew and whipp observation based on empirical case studies that a strategic change is a result of the interaction between content of change what objectives purpose and goals process or how of change is implemented and the organizational context of change the internal and external environment  in practice it is seen that some private sector health organizations were better able than others and especially than public ones to improve their competitive performance moreover while young organization tends to be energetic and oriented to change a mature one is prone to conservatism and protection of the resources and authority they have acquired  for that reason health organizations alike other open systems must relate effectively to its external environment without sacrificing hard won prior accomplishments as a start in response to the specific needs identified health organizations should have developed missions and visions statements vision and mission declarations are necessary step in strategic planning management and leading processes thus a significant management concern is how to remain dynamic and innovative while acknowledging that health organization development is determined by several factors like it is the position in the system their functional capabilities and unique personalities in addition governing body arrangements act as drivers of change by influencing who should the health organization serve and how should purpose be determined on the other side who is health organization supposed to serve is imposed by powerful external stakeholders besides the suitability acceptability and feasibility of health organizational change are to be assessed within the ethical stance of the organization and social context the climate of integrations and globalization itself open the space for new values and new generations of health managers  the principles like solidarity equity and accessibility which are legacy in some health systems sometimes are confronted with feature of other philosophy values that imply fast growth and accomplishments  finally usual macroenvironment forces historical cultural economic and political factors require balancing between directions to “fit” and to “stretch” to all of the mentioned challenges   fundamental reckoning for a strategic leading of a health organization are the well designed vision and mission the leader of a health organization should have imagination should be unorthodox and challengeable but at the same time be clear and practical to assure objectives achievability and realization within the legislative framework  therefore leaders are rare instead frequent are managers or management teams but more often we see directors of health institutions who follow directions since it is likely they face multiple priorities and pressures they should constantly strive to maintain a proper balance between reactive and proactive postures the passive posture of management boards of directors should be replaced by proactive and sometimes aggressive one as it is understood a decade ago “what we need today maybe is not new theory or new conception or framework but they are people that can thing like strategists”  the key strategic values of the new era are innovations quality speed flexibility and continual improvement those attributes are also the prerequisites for a modern strategic and health management in a complex and dynamic social ambient important for heath manager who is strategist also is to frequently reinquire the aim of the health organization strategic position and operational policy since everything that will happen is hard to plan and it is important to take into account the fact that any intervention may set off unexpected costs  by analyzing the internal strengths and weaknesses of an organization in the light of the external threats and opportunities one should be able to adequately determine the vision mission objectives policy and goals of a health institution the key questions modified after norburn and birley in planning the strategic orientation of a health institution are presented in table   table  keys questions for mission and vision development of a health organization questions keys what is our job to understand the field where health organization operates the level it is in and the services it offers to whom to analyze the external environment health sector market and competitors what is our position in the health service production framework where are we now to analyze resources competences and competitive advantage what should be our future position to analyze stakeholders expectations power energy and interest what activities successfully to it to analyze approaches benchmarking will lead good models and where do we want to be to create organizational vision strategic intent and strategic positioning in future how do we get there to plan organizational structure directions development strategies and to design policy the mission statement is generalized statement of the purpose of the organization also it defines and specifies the vision of the organization starting from  the geographical territory target market philosophy and production conditions like quality and social responsibility in the literature various approaches exist for development of mission prescriptive approaches usually emphasize the need to set out a mission and objectives for the next few years some managers accept the need but emphasize the bottom up approach and inclusive development of health organizational core values emergent approaches doubt the usefulness as the future is so uncertain ansoff and mcdonell point out that mission represent the aspiration or intentions of stakeholders that organization serves  johnson and scholes call it like „raison deêtre”  the reason it exists as such in social and economical context  complementary drucker signifies it as the way that one could create its new clients or customers  in summary it should be in line with the expectations of the key stakeholders and the reasoning behind it key values of health organization should be incorporated in the mission in the form of beliefs attitudes image tradition truism symbols legitimacy cultural web and sometimes values are stakeholders themselves mission statements should be visionary description of the position in the health service production framework’ as it outlines the broad future directions missions are followed by objectives which are more detailed usually quantified measurable and achievable in a specific a time period so the identity of health institution is its mission philosophy cultural web values principles beliefs and policy and is its purpose the mission is important to be set before putting into practice an effective change initiative or strategic plans because it should guide the health organization through strategy implementation the strengths and competencies of managers to improve the position of health organization are reflected in vision vision should be clear inspiration for the both internal eg employees owners and unions and external stakeholders eg clients suppliers competitors and local community clarity can be obtained by very natural statements like what are our purpose framework competencies and unique values for the vision development it is useful to explore what stays the same in health organization despite continual efforts and necessities to change  the crucial health organization stewardship comprises intelligent use of the knowledge and power regulations and data sets that will upgrade understanding and commitment of employees to the mission and vision  besides managers it is expected that other professionals and staff of health organization show a growing interest in understanding how they can develop the skills and attitudes required in a visionary health organization and service a team of high performance that creates vision for the longer period should interact with each other in real talk and open listening to confront the obstacles with risk tolerant high energy and high trust there is a large and growing body of evidence that demonstrates a positive linkage between the development of human capital and organizational performance moreover a health organization market value depends less on tangible resources but rather on intangible ones particularly human resources all human capital forms notably intellectual social and organizational  in shaping a health organizational performance human resources are assets and liabilities in linking overall coherence with vision depending on how internal and external business communication is regulated the local and national prestige and growth among customers will eventually be visible  so  sharing the vision with all multidisciplinary teams in hisher organization is another core issue the final points will be that vision is „what can be“eg our new way of organization functioning

in the broad directions to be followed in the future strategically thinking from the vision agreed upon we realize what should be our mission and objectives of the organization starting from the real circumstances and creating new one if necessary in other words modern strategic planning should be supported by creativity below are presented strategic statements of some health organizations showing

arguing certain health policy issue this module examines the health policy development and in particular the functions of health policy analysis in the policymaking process the module starts with a short overview of the historical background of policy analysis which shows that the aim of policy analysis today as in the past has been to provide policymakers with information that can be used to solve practical problems the module continues with a description of the policy development in the health sector although policy analysis is an intellectual activity it is also embedded in a social and political process known as policymaking health policies are important because it is what gives content to the practices of the health sector policies are expressed in a whole series of practices statements regulations and even laws which are the result of decisions about how we will do things  teaching methods specific recommendations for teachers assessment of students this module contrasts and compares several models of health policy development each of which captures an important aspect of the complex process of policymaking an introductory lecture gives the students first insight in elements and process of health policy analysis and development the theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study beforeafter introductory lectures students carefully read the recommended advanced readings afterwards they discuss the elements of health policy and the process of hp development with other students especially the designing and planning phase problem identification policy

milevskakostova elisaveta stikova doncho donev theoretical background policy analysis in the policy making process public policy and policy analysis even though the roots of the policy as science and the policy analysis lay in the political sciences over the past several decades public policy has developed in a separate scientific discipline with policy analysis as its tool aimed today as in the past at providing policymakers with information that can be used to solve practical problems the main purpose of policy analysis is to improve policy making this is not an easy task especially when we consider that many of the most important policy changes are gradual disjointed and incremental large discontinuous changes are relatively rare and they stem from shocks that are exogenous to the policymaking process not from a relatively marginal influence of analyses conducted within the process  among the policy analysts there is an unwritten rule that good policy analysis often yields better policies in order to make good policy analysis it is essential to know its rules elements and procedures that combine it this module essentially deals with the elements and procedures but also with the whole context in which the policy analysis would take its place in a most efficient way to give informed and timely positions and opinions to the policymakers during the process of decision making policymaking and the policy cycle the process of policymaking is often solely related to the actions of preparation adoption and implementation of policies it is associated with policy makers or decision makers as the ultimate power holders to adopt political decisions but this complex process is much more than a galvanistic twitch   it embraces some hidden aspects of agenda setting through a systematic approach as well as through mobilization of interest groups around particular issue it involves advocacy and lobbying for stakeholders’ most preferred policy alternative at one and the evaluation and monitoring of the implementation at the other end of the spectrum some authors describe the policymaking as a reiterative process often called policy cycle the policy cycle has defined steps which can be repeated depending on the level of achievement of the goals or satisfaction of the stakeholders it can also be repeated as many times as the policy process requires in order to establish effective policy which in reality does happen even though it is not resourcewise an efficient way of policy making  elements of policy cycle in search for geometric and logical explanation of the otherwise fairly intuitive process the researchers have proposed a model of policy cycle with defined steps that lead into effective policy making basically the policy cycle consists of  to  steps depending on the level of fragmentation of the steps by various authors the cycle opens with a policy agenda setting b issue identification c formulationspecification of the policy alternatives d decision on the most acceptableoptimal policy alternative e policy implementation and f monitoring and evaluation of the policy implementation additionally some authors  propose that the segment of policy maintenance succession or termination be separated from the last step as it is recognized as very important part embedding another round of decision making but the cycle does not have to be started at the agenda setting it can also commence from the evaluation of previous policy or it can continue from any given point at which the process has once stopped for various internal or external reasons thus it is very important to understand that policy cycle is a “messy order” of events and actions that eventually lead to applicable solution of the chosen policy problem figure  policy process stages  simplified timeline policy agenda setting the policy agenda setting is by far the most delicate step of all in the policy making process here all stakeholders have an open arena for putting forward issues alternatives and solutions in front of the political power holders it is often thought that this step is closed and exclusive to the decision makers but in reality we experience much more interference from other usually very influential parties such as the business sector or strong civil society movements the importance of this step in furthering ones policy issue higher on the agenda is closely related to the significance of the timing chosen for pushing certain policy issue there are more and less suitable times for introduction and advocating for certain policy issue for example it is very unlikely that the proabortion policy  will be adopted during a conservative party ruling it is highly inefficient to push an environmental issue during a nationwide security crisis at the border etc thus it is up to the advocates of the policy issuealternative to assess and wait for an appropriate time to seed it and to expect fertile soil for their position to be grown these socalled policy windows are times when we can expect wide acceptance from both politics and general public and those are judged and forecasted by experienced policy analysts public interest alone does not guarantee that an issue will be placed on the policy agenda to be placed on the agenda policy makers must consider the issue within the purview of government action and deserving of public attention many different approaches are used to place an issue at the forefront of the policy agenda enormous influence in the process of agenda setting can be expected from the powerful business sector depending on the relevance of the issue to their operations however one should not underestimate the power of the opinion leaders in the society those are sometimes influential researchers and professionals thinktank organizations international community and of course  the media as a major source of political information the media help shape the public’s perception of the reality these perceptions constitute a basis for the public’s political activity it’s very important to emphasize that political parties serve as linkages or intermediaries between the citizens and their government as edmund burke said in   a party is a body of man united for promoting by their endeavours the national interest upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed regarding his statement officially and unofficially political parties have a major role in agenda setting process party leaders have major role in determining the agenda of the party in advance of an election and than balancing the conflict priorities of various interest groups between elections  issue identificationspecification once the issue is set sufficiently high on the political agenda policy makers must develop a broad policy agenda into specific policy option it is the process of policy formulation policy formulation involves developing alternative proposals and than collecting analyzing and communicating the information necessary to assess the alternatives and begin to persuade people to support one proposal or another policy formulation involves compromising and bargaining in order to satisfy various interests and build a coalition of support the decision makers are themselves becoming the moving force for solving the policy problem they seek analyses opinions and advice from their own or external sources that they find relevant and reliable it is not unusual for the policy and decision makers to look for several positions before making a decision even though in the newer democracies this process is often ended by selection of the issue among the peers of the ruling government this is also a stage at which researchers and professionals should exhibit their views and findings as the issue identification and its formulation can give way to improper understanding or misleading outcome for the policy in policy formulation information is assembled arguments developed and alternatives shaped towards winning the approval of policy makers  analysis and specification of policy alternatives issue identification requires tough decision by the decision makers the policy analysis and specification of policy alternatives puts this burden on the shoulders of policy analysts and researchers any given issue can be solved in an infinite number of ways which are dependent on different social economic but also political factors this part of the policy process is very much relying on understanding of the national context and specificities legal framework and economic potentials of the country as well as on the degree of political will mentality of the people and readiness of the social and physical infrastructure for example there may be a significant political will to introduce a smoking ban in the country but other factors may impede its implementation such as the willingness of people to understand and accept potentials of the commercial sector to adapt to the needed standards and sufficiency of the inspection services to implement the measures so that the policy will become fully effective since if any of the given factors and preconditions are not met the created leak of policy will lead to further anarchical behaviour lined with diminishing of trust in the government institutions and disbelief in their capacity to implement any policy in the future another important factor when choosing the most optimal policy alternatives to be presented to the decision makers is the forecasted or calculated in case of sufficient data fiscal implication of the alternative it is highly unlikely that the decision makers will choose even a more effective policy solution that places big budgetary burden over another maybe not as effective but which requires minimal or no budget spending for implementation choosing the most suitableoptimal policy alternative any decision maker would not like to be placed in front of one policy solution that has to be taken for granted based on the judgment of the policy analysts knowing this experienced policy researchers will often present at least   most often   policy options on the table of them almost without exception the zero alternative or the status quo policy option is one as it shows what would happen if the situation of the selected policy remains unaltered while other circumstances inevitably change with time an illustrative example would be the analysis of the introduction of electronic health cards in which the zero option of continuing the practice of paper health records is matched against the developing it society in terms of funds consumed by paper use possibilities for abuse of data time consumption for communicating health data among institutions storage space etc in this part of the work as can be seen from the example the analysts offer social economic and political analysis and forecast to the decision makers for each offered policy alternative while at the end proposing the most preferable one against all mentioned criteria in the real world however sometimes it happens that the decision makers already have their own preferred solution even before the analysis is done this kind of “precommissioned” work is referred to as garbage bin policy approach  in which the solution is known before the problem is identified or simply  the solution is attached to a problem for reasons such as political image building  pushing certain group’s vested interests instead of public interests etc once the policy has been formulated statements of government policies and programs are promulgated policy implementation after another round of difficult decisionmaking finally the policy comes to the stage of implementation here the decision makers should be aware and maybe made aware by the policy analysts of the necessary infrastructure for proper implementation or the actions that should be taken to strengthen or enlarge it those actions become priority and take immediate execution this is the test for both the political willingness and the potentials for success of the selected policy alternative implementation involves three activities directed towards putting a policy into effect the three activities required for implementation are − interpretation − organization and − application interpretation means the translation of the programmatic language into acceptable and feasible administrative directives these can be lows regulations decisions and resources allocation organization requires the establishment of administrative units and methods necessary to put a program into effect resources like money building staff equipment are important for implementation of the formulated policy issues application requires the services to be routinely administered the process of interpreting and organization to implement policy goals it is often termed strategic planning strategy planning must be then followed by operational planning and management as a part of the application phase of the implementation yet putting certain policy in the daylight should go hand in hand with its monitoring and evaluation  for the simple reason of knowing its effects but also gaps and challenges as well as possibilities for improvement once they are identified the policy analyst again here plays crucial role in walking handinhand with the decision makers using its forecasting and policy adaptation skills monitoring and evaluation each policymaking authority in the country should consider monitoring and evaluation as its integral part and thus always make sure that there are sufficient resources for their execution this is often not the case in the newer democracies so usually even good policies suffer in their implementation as there is no corrective mechanism to alarm about the faults in the system essential part of the monitoring is setting realistic performance indicators measuring them and evaluating each one against the expected outcomes of the policy set during the issue identification and policy analysis stages the results obtained will serve as feed into the next step which will be made fairly easy to perform once the necessary decisionmaking data is in place  deciding the termination policy fate maintenance succession or under the condition that the monitoring and evaluation stages have been properly performed and this is not to be considered a onetime action the decision on whether the chosen policy alternative is to be continued modified or completely ceased is relatively easy to adopt if of course other political interests are not interfering with the decision as the later is often the case the role of monitoring and evaluation is thus more important as it can strengthen the position against the decision made solely on the political interest base figure  the process of policy analysis adapted from dunn wn  health policy development health policy agenda in the health sector the ultimate goal of the policy and decision makers is expected to be the wellbeing of the population universal access to health services andor providing better healthcare at optimal budget spending as this is a very broad definition of a mission of health authorities it includes infinite number of issues that need to be solved addressed or improved so it is of quite an importance the order by which they are addressed or the timing at which they are put onto the table for example the issue of propagating breastfeeding is not an unimportant  one but it has lower priority over providing health access to the whole population including the rural areas not that the healthy diet and nutrition programs are less important but the vaccination preventive program will certainly be given a higher priority on the government policy agenda etc yet one should be aware that sometimes some apparently “less important” issues are put on the agenda for different reasons among which eg the political rating improvement and those policy windows should be used to push forward particular policy alternatives ideally optimal for the general public or the vast majority of population major role in setting the health policy agenda is played by the international community especially in the developing countries this very noble intention can sometimes be motivated by the objectives of solving the macroeconomic situation in the country rather than by the goals of establishing a good system that would provide high quality healthcare other times it is related to a trend in the world that would not necessarily be of high value if applied to an unprepared national context thus it is very important to judge the source of the policy agenda setting in order to be able to react upon it according to the national priorities and needs in this very sensitive social service sector health policy analysis in a not much different way from other areas in the society the health policy analysis is using the methods and procedures as explained above for informing health policymakers and decisionmakers the political consensus over the importance of a certain issue is much easier to obtain in the health sector rather than for example in the sphere of national security thus here a much bigger challenge is the issue selection together with the choice of the preferred policy alternative health sector being one of those in which there is always relatively higher demand than supply or much bigger need than resources available the choice is often difficult to make from the aspect of financial or human resources and infrastructure availability for example there is no government that will not agree with the importance of providing equal access to high quality healthcare for all citizens but the financial limitations will certainly play crucial role in navigating the process to this end the key criteria for the health policy analysis are bound to financial constraints of the country’s economy and overcoming these constraints is elaborated below and in the case study given at the end of this module key criteria in setting priorities health policy formulation and alternatives as said before one of the key criteria in health policy making is related to the financial constraints or possibilities of the country’s economy taking into consideration the fact that still the health sector is predominantly perceived as “resource spending” spending on healthcare rather than as “resource generating” building a healthy workforce this criterion will have the last word in deciding the most optimal health policy alternative box  another not less important criteria is that most of the policy makers would like to see in the policy analysis the outreach and the scope of population that would benefit from the given policy to each policy maker that considers fulfilment  of the mission of hisher organization would ask on the magnitude and effects of the policy if applied as priority in the system heshe will certainly understand a comparison between a policy on drug abuse prevention and vaccination for example choosing one over the other will have to give good arguments and justification for making such choice in terms of holding themselves accountable in front of the citizens that voted for them last but not least among the key criteria is the timeframe of achievement of results or visibility of the policy implementation shortterm objective are always preferred but a good argumentation of a longterm and strategic goals can lead to choice of a far better solution over just another “headline for this month’s journal” major players in health policy formulation regardless of the efforts of the governments in developing countries it is an often seen scenario that the major players in setting the policy agenda and health policy formulation are the governments of developed countries or the international community this is sometimes deliberate but many times also unintended outcome of bilateral or multilateral agreements and relationships offering international or own solutions for local problems heavily bound to national contexts is a common practice among different health sector consultants projects or programs even though made with good intentions such applications of unadjusted policy solutions can lead to major damages to the health system in one country  and as health sector is vitally dealing with human lives such damages by faulty health policy decisions can have unforeseeable consequences to the nation’s economy as well box  criteria for setting priorities in health policy and planning medical criteria frequency of the disease prevalence and incidence disease duration seriousness of the disease consequences complications disease lethality and fatality rabies aids tetanus needs for problems solving according to professionals’ evaluation economic criteria financial expenses regarding the disease for doctor service delivery payment medicaments rehabilitation etc permanent incapability for work disability temporary incapability for work absenceabsenteeism economic rationality and sustainability of investments in finding decision for certain health problem eg construction of water supply and drainage systems immunization financial constraints or possibilities of the country’s economy social criteria particular sociomedical importance of certain population groups children students and youngsters women workers elderly people etc possibilities for practical solution of the problem possibility for encompassing certain population groups compactness of the group for eg school children workers how much the solution of one problem is independent from the solution of another problems timeframe of achievement of results and visibility of the policy and program implementation  human criteria number of people that will benefit from the solution of a certain problem or from the given health policy populations requests for finding solution regarding a certain problem the effects that will be achieved when the problem is resolved more effects together thus it is very important that the health policy is created and structured by researchers and analysts that have profound knowledge of the national context and specificities imported solutions may be a good base for change but only if matched against the local background needs and possibilities advocating health policy in every policy issue or problem there are a number of stakeholders that have their positions interests and knowledge or information and therefore an environment of different pressures is created in the case of health policy not only the pressure from the professional community or government can be very high but also the patients or users of the health system can have strong positions about a certain case since the health policy is directly influencing their life lifestyle or living standard in the process of advocating for certain health policy in most of the cases the first issue that should be addressed is the common misunderstanding of the standing of the patients and medical professionals within the system as often seen the medical profession finds itself opposed to the patients and in fact this is major misinterpretation of the roles of both the doctors and the patients are on the same side of the coin as they both work and aim at  better health and prolongation of human life  each in their own role and own way once having planted for this through the selected health issue that is advocated for the health policy process will much easier move through the labyrinths of its own development there are different ways of doing advocacy it can be both formal and informal with or without written documents it can take several months to several years depending on the readiness of the stakeholders to take into account the opinion of others and listen to their arguments but whichever pathway is selected the key to successful advocacy is to be ready to give up the ownership of the idea something not very typical in the scientific and research community to be prepared to hear others advocating for the idea which helps the process as it shows acceptance and raised awareness on the issue and to be open for dialogue objectively accepting other positions and alternatives case study patients rights as policy issue  case of macedonia introduction in most of the countries of south eastern europe prior to the transition there was no single legislation regulating the rights of patients but those rights were stipulated in several healthcare and healthcare insurance laws and bylaw documents one of the activities of some of the new eu memberstates during the process of preparation for accession in the eu was the adjustment of the health care legislation towards the  european legislation and standards such was the case with hungary that in  enacted the new health care act in which most of the patients’ rights are regulated such as the right to healthcare right to be treated with dignity right to information right to refuse treatment right to information privacy right to leave the health care institution right to complaint right to die with dignity right to participation in decisionmaking in health care etc  further the dramatic changes that have taken place in the past decade in central and eastern europe have caused the large inequalities in health to grow even bigger not only between but also within the countries in the region this statement can be well backed up with the national health statistics which “give a stark illustration of the effect of economic crisis and widespread pollution of the environment on the health of whole populations are revealing a growing health divides”  the process was driven by the common health and social policy in the eu which despite the differences of the national health systems is placing the same rights of patients consumers users family members weak populations and ordinary people at risk as described in the preamble of the european charter of patients’ rights “financial constraints however justified cannot legitimize denying or compromising patients rights the nice charter of fundamental rights will soon be part of the new european constitution it is the basis of the declaration of the fourteen concrete patients rights currently at risk the right to preventive measures access information consent free choice privacy and confidentiality respect of patients time observance of quality standards safety innovation avoidance of unnecessary suffering and pain and personalized treatment and the right to complain and to receive compensation”  as this process has not been completely undergone by the candidate countries for eu membership among which the republic of macedonia we have decided to start the process of preparation of the terrain for endorsement of a single legislative document which will consolidate all existing and newly introduced rights the process prior to the transition in the republic of macedonia there was no single legislation regulating the rights of patients but those rights were stipulated in several healthcare and health insurance laws and bylaw documents the previously existing healthcare legislation health law of  law for healthcare of  has regulated the patients’ rights and duties to certain extent the currently governing law for healthcare  is more extensive in regulating these rights however not all of the rights described in the european charter of patient’s rights have been regulated the health care act of  regulates the functioning of the healthcare system in the country and consists of the following chapters a the health insurance b rights and responsibilities of the healthcare users c the rights and responsibilities of the healthcare providers d organizational structure of the healthcare system and e financing of the healthcare  according to the existing legislation  of the  rights were regulated in one of the mentioned documents  however the analysis of the existing legislation regarding the exercising of rights and duties of the patients and of the implementation practices in the country the following conditions have been identified  − lack of appropriate and systematized legislation directly regulating patients’ rights − insufficient level of implementation of the existing legislation − lack of knowledge and ignorance of patients regarding their rights − nontransparent attitude of the healthcare authorities regarding information of the citizens for their rights but also duties as patients − lack of technical support in the healthcare facilities for complete implementation of certain rights of patients such as the right to privacy and confidentiality of personal and medical data the team decided that a health policy in r macedonia should be developed following the identified conditions methodology the first step taken after the situation analysis in r macedonia in  was the screening of the legislation and practices in the neighbourhood and in the eu as ultimate reference for the country’s governance the similar laws adopted in these countries have been taken as samples to start the drafting process of the law the questionnaire was prepared based on several sample questionnaires used for surveying of patients’ satisfaction in different healthcare facilities bearing in mind the local mentality practices and the level of trust in the institutions of the system a number of general questions have been put in the first part of the questionnaire in order to get the patients’ confidence and sense of real involvement in the survey in order to collect more data for construction of case studies database of this project the participants have been interviewed by a group of trained interviewers  the sampling technique was the one of multistage sampling this included the selection of healthcare facilities the socalled series of clusters based on the target group eg facilities to which certain ethnicities gravitate from each of which a random sample of patients has been selected eg patients visiting the healthcare facility on the day of the survey results despite the different but very high levels of regulation of patients’ rights in the legislation the implementation levels have been expectedly similar the interviews reported a situation with the physicianpatient relationship even expressed as “the fatherphysician taking care of the childpatient” the reasons can be searched in the previous system but can also be found in the ignorance of the patients regarding their rights the only survey that was undertaken under this research conducted in macedonia on  individuals shows that over  of the interviewed are not aware of the benefits from or the mere existence of most of the patients’ rights the most commonly heard of but not often exercised is the right to compensation for treatment received abroad next to it is the right to compensation for the medications on the positive list heavily  subsidized which have been purchased for a full price in a private pharmacy the main reason why the  of the interviewees were not exercising these rights is the complicated and lengthy procedures administered by the health insurance fund as well as the unclear method of reimbursement apart from these two the other rights are mostly looked at as obligations for example the right to free choice of physician in the primary healthcare the socalled “maticen lekar” with similar functions as the family physician is considered an obligation imposed by the law on the other hand the more general explanation of the right to free choice of physician is almost prejudicially linked to the visit of a private physician’s office most of which have no contract with the health insurance fund charging the full price for the health services provided which can be done without any referral and upon free judgment of the individual closely resembling to this is the attitude for signing the informed consent which for over half of the interviewed patients is just another “administrative procedure” the survey has confirmed the general notion and the acceptance by the patients of the paternalistic approach in the physicianpatient relationship among the interviewees  are satisfied  very and  averagely from the services received over  have never intentionally been to another physician or asked for a second opinion furthermore  are convinced that the physician is prescribing them the best possible medicationstherapy that they need and  comply as much as they can afford with the recommendations and advices given by the doctor even though the right to complain is regulated and guaranteed in the legislation an astonishing  has never had any questions or complaints regarding the medical services received or healthcare facility procedures undergone the background to this is more likely the decreased confidence in the institutions of the system or ignorance regarding the mechanisms and institutions in which the legal advice or cure can be sought the reasons for such high level of satisfaction may be partly related to the structure of the interviewed group namely  have no official job or no job at all of which  are covered with basic health insurance through the unemployed benefits system  the basic health insurance which is in no way different than what a regularly employed person receives by regular payment of taxes and payroll contributions to the state budget and to the single health insurance fund note the macedonian system of health insurance still being in a very initial stage of healthcare reforms does not have different health insurance policies and health insurance institutions which employees or employers can choose from for better health care coverage the comparative analysis of the legislation and regulative instruments in the countries of southeast europe and the survey of the level of implementation of the legislation in the republic of macedonia two approaches for improvement of protection and promotion of the patients’ rights impose both involving changes in the legal environment in terms of improved implementation of the current legislation or introduction of new instruments and mechanisms for exercising patients’ rights combined with other advocacy and public awareness raising activities involving the civil sector  alternatives following the health policy development process the results were then transformed into policy alternatives that were offered to the policy maker  the ministry of health alternative  improved implementation of the current legislation this alternative includes changes in the implementation mechanisms of the legislation but also assuming undertaking public awareness raising activities one of the main components to protection of patients’ rights is the understanding of their violation by both the patient and the physician or the institution moreover as the patients are usually treated by a team of physicians nurses and technicians in a complex unfamiliar and sometimes frightening setting they are often being treated as nonperson and thus raising feelings of anonymity and isolation because of this the institutionpatient relationship is almost equally important as the doctorpatient relationship significant aspect in the improvement of the implementation of the legislation is the enhanced knowledge and perception of the general public but of the health professionals as well in which the civil sector is expected to play major role  through awareness raising campaigns offering legal advices and assistance in understanding and utilizing the mechanisms of the system the main portion of the costs for implementing this alternative will be related to the public awareness raising campaigns yet a significant portion shall be considered for providing technical support computers database servers software development for enabling the implementation of certain rights such as the right to confidentiality but also the right to information about the medical condition of the patient alternative  improvement of the legislation a far more complex alternative is the one requiring changes in the current legislation this means restructuring of the existing healthcare acts for better presentation of the patients’ rights in one place commonly in one chapter of a single law as seen from the experiences of the countries in the region but possibly introduction of new mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of the level of exercising of patients’ rights one such idea vastly debated in the health and legal professional communities is the introduction of a separate system of healthcare ombudsman under which patients can sought legal advice and assistance through recommendations for the institutions of the judiciary system in some countries like hungary and since recently serbia and montenegro each health care setting has an appointed “advocates” responsible for receiving and advising upon patients’ claims or complaints this approach provides firsthand legal aid on the existing mechanisms but can also serve as a filter for the unjustified claims thus contributing towards the more efficient implementation of the legislation regarding this very neglected but important legal sphere  the costs incurring from implementing this alternative are mostly in the setting up and maintaining the newly proposed institutional settings and mechanisms however in this alternative as well some public health education campaigns will be required mostly in the direction of increasing the knowledge and awareness of the general public both of the existing rights but of the novelty in the system as well with the current level of reforms in the healthcare system but in the judiciary as well it is hard to expect that additional funds can be provided for the implementation of this alternative rather the existing ombudsman office and its infrastructure can be used for engagement of a specialized health law professional also another lowcost intervention is the public reporting of the ombudsman about the number and types of claims which will encourage the patients in a more aware way to accept and exercise their rights but duties as patients as well the process  continued based on the results of this initiative from the civil sector the alternatives offered and the eu directives in november  the ministry of health established a task force for preparation of law on protection of patients’ rights inviting key experts government and professional community representatives ngos and patients’ organizations as well as media representatives to participate in this process after almost one year of polishing the differences in the stakeholders’ opinions and positions at professional meetings and public debates and finally in november  the government adopted the law and passed it on to the parliament for final endorsement in the parliament more than  amendments were made by the members of the parliament the relevant ones were adopted and the ones that were not of essential importance or were in collision with other legislation were rejected with sufficient and justified explanation in february  the draftlaw was put on the parliament agenda for voting advocating health policy the process of advocacy for this health policy was not very different from the one explained in the theoretical part of this module the issue was perceived as such that it required strong commitment from the government but also large support from the professional community the level of understanding the patients’ rights and duties to a point of being able to convert them as the rights and duties of the health professionals was not present and this needed to be advocated for instruments such as policy briefs informal communication with doctors’ chamber medical association and other professional organizations were made together with formal presentations of the concept at scientific meetings however the end result of this health policy development is not the endorsement of this law it is yet to be confirmed and monitored how it is implemented whether it should be maintained improved or simply terminated if it does not show results comparable to the fiscal implications it may have in other words this and any other health policy is a continued process with constant need of evaluation and adjustment according to the changing needs and demands of the society and all its segments  exercises

students should • know the role of crosssectional surveys as an effective tool in planning public health interventions • know the position and importance of crosssectional surveys in evidencebased public health • be familiar with some cases of domestic and foreign crosssectional surveys health surveys are observational epidemiological studies of health status of the population in which usually a crosssection through frequency and characteristics of health outcomes and other health related events like exposures are studied and therefore provide prevalence data surveys are very applicable in searching for general insight in health states and conditions that last a relatively long time as well as various risk factors for them their results could be efficiently used in planning public health address for correspondence keywords learning objectives abstract interventions and in fact today they represent one of the most important tools of evidence based public health teaching methods the module is presenting basic theoretical background necessary for understanding the usefulness of health surveys in planning public health interventions as well as it provides a case study an introductory lecture gives the students first insight in characteristics of crosssectional studies the theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study after introductory lectures students first carefully read the recommended readings afterwards they discuss the characteristics of health surveys and their potential power for effective health care planning especially in the field of public health in continuation they need to find published materials eg papers on health surveys and present how they were used or supposed to be used in planning public health interventions  specific

bologna scheme multiple choice questionnaire  health surveys as a powerful tool in planning public health interventions lijana zaletelkragelj ivan eržen theoretical background basic definitions and explanations of terms surveys and health surveys surveys could be defined in several ways two of them being • according to a dictionary of epidemiology  surveys are defined as investigations in which information is systematically collected but in which the experimental method is not used and • according to rossi and freeman surveys are systematic collection of information from a defined population usually by means of interviews or questionnaires administered to a sample of units in the population  health surveys are surveys designated to provide information on the health status of a population they could be descriptive exploratory or explanatory synonym for a disease frequency survey is a crosssectional study  in health surveys data could be collected by the means of questionnaires facetoface interview telephone interview or selfcompleted questionnaires or by the means of health examination usually in combination with interview according to which tool is used to collect data in health surveys there exist two main types of them  • health interview surveys or his  surveys in which collection of data is carried out only by the means of questionnaires in his questionnaires may be communicated to the study subjects in three ways through mail questionnaire through personal or facetoface interview or through telephone interview • health examination surveys or hes  surveys which are usually a combination of questionnaires and health examination including diagnostic and laboratory tests in hes the contact between participants and research personnel is personal since the health examination is a component part of the survey in this type of surveys also questionnaires are usually communicated to the selected study subjects through personal interview crosssectional studies there exist several similar definitions of crosssectional studies • according to a dictionary of epidemiology  crosssectional studies are studies that examine the relationship between diseases or other healthrelated characteristics and other phenomena of interest in a defined population at a particular time • a summary of several other definitions is that crosssectional studies are observational epidemiological studies of health status of the population in  which a »snapshot« of or a crosssection through frequency and characteristics of health outcomes and other health related events like exposures are studied  this characteristic also gave the name to this type of epidemiological studies crosssectional studies are studies that measure the prevalence of health outcomes or determinants of health or both in a population at a specific point in time or over a short period  health outcomes and other health related events could be measured in crosssectional studies on different measurement scale in those crosssectional studies in which the outcome event is dichotomous the prevalence of this dichotomous event is recorded this is the reason that crosssectional studies are also called prevalence studies     prevalence studies thus could be on one hand regarded as a subgroup of crosssectional studies  while on the other hand all crosssectional studies could be regarded as prevalence studies since we can dichotomize values of every observed outcome the selected specific point in time could be a time window within which data are collected eg calendar week or month it could also be a specific point in time in the course of events differing in respect of each individual study subject with regard to the actual time beginning of schooling retirement etc    frequently crosssectional epidemiological studies are designated as crosssectional surveys  detailed description of crosssectional studies’ characteristics is given in numerous textbooks and handbooks including advantages and disadvantages     aims      methods and tools       and course phases and periods    although all phasesperiods of crosssectional studies’ course are important planning period is the most important and most sensitive period if designing and planning the crosssectional study in the wrong way the whole study could be set on an inappropriate basis and the deficiencies of this period are very difficult to be eliminated in the later phases of the crosssectional studies in order to avoid as many faults as possible the course of the crosssectional studies must be planned systematically and with all due care a precise management of individual crosssectional study is very difficult to be advised nevertheless common recommendations on actions in designing and planning phases of the crosssectional studies exist  intervention and public health intervention several definitions exist of what the intervention is among which could be find the following • an intervention is a generic term used to denote all public actions eg policies programmes projects  • an intervention is an action or programme that aims to bring about identifiable outcomes  planneddesired effects of an intervention expressed in terms of outcomes are general objectives of an intervention a public health intervention is an intervention which is applied to many most or all members of a community with the aim to deliver a specific benefit to the  community or population as well as benefits to individuals  public health interventions include  • policies of governments and nongovernmental organisations • laws and regulations • organisational development • community development • education of individuals and communities • engineering and technical developments • service development and delivery and • communication including social marketing crosssectional surveys – an important tool in evidence based public health today crosssectional surveys represent one of the most important tools of evidence based public health  unfortunately these studies are less powerful in comparison to randomized controlled trials  the main study design in evidence based medicine also the volume of evidence is smaller and the time from intervention to outcome is longer  nevertheless they have some advantages over randomized controlled trials countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention cindi programme surveys the world health organization who countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention cindi programme is an intervention programme with integration as a key concept in prevention of chronic noncommunicable diseases  it arose out of experiences of one of the first communitybased health intervention projects in europe  the north karelia project in finland which started in  and reached remarkable achievements as well as global recognition  surveys which are aimed on one hand at assessment of burden of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and on the other hand at evaluation of process of cindi programme are essential component part of this programme   today we distinguish between two types of cindi surveys   • cindi risk factors and process evaluation surveys   this type of surveys is a hes type of surveys and represents a basic type of cindi surveys which provide the basic data for starting a cindi programme in a country and on its progress this type of surveys is in most cindi countries performed on a level of demonstrational area or at most region • cindi health monitor survey   this type of surveys is a his type of surveys his surveys which offer the most rough but comprehensive overview on the problems tightly associated with noncommunicable diseases this type of cindi surveys is mostly aiming at monitoring assessing and comparing the trend of health behaviour in cindi countries with different politicallyeconomic  systems owing to comparability monitoring should be conducted under the uniform methodology and on a national level case study countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention cindi programme and related surveys in slovenia in planning public health interventions countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention cindi programme and related surveys in slovenia there exist several types of surveys which provide important information for planning public health interventions for controlling noncommunicable disease in slovenia   cindi health monitor survey   this type of survey was performed in slovenia for the first time in   for the second time in  and for the third time in  with its national and at the same time regional level this type of surveys in slovenia represent very strong support to development of evidence based policy on both levels what is extremely important in the process of diminishing interregional differences at the same time it is very powerful tool for evaluation of the effectiveness of health promotion programmes all databases include data on about  participants’ health behaviour  cindi risk factors and process evaluation survey     so far there were three surveys performed at the demonstrational level ljubljana demonstrational region – in winter  in winter  and in winter   adhoc surveys  among adhoc surveys the beltinci process evaluation surveys should be mentioned in the first place  with the means of two consecutive surveys of hes type of surveys the effect of one year intervention programme in beltinci community was evaluated the surveys were basing on cindi risk factors and process evaluation surveys methodology these surveys and resulting databases are the basis for different specific studies aiming at planning as much effective public health interventions as possible cindi health monitor surveys as a tool for development of effective intervention programmes for enhancing healthy nutrition and physical activity in adult population background behavioural risk factors are among the most important risk factors for noncommunicable diseases  a study showed that prevalence of some risk factors for cardiovascular diseases among which unhealthy nutrition and physical activity habits seems to be the most unfavourable one in eastern slovenia  in order to determine population groups  at highest risk for unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes as well to determine population groups at highest risk for insufficient physical activity a special study was performed the intention was to prepare a high quality basis for working out the strategies guidelinesrecommendations as well as concrete implementation action plans for long term diminishing high mortality attributable to noncommunicable diseases  methods the data from cindi health monitor chm  database were used  the sample size was  and the age range  years the response rate was   responses the questionnaires of  respondents were eligible for analysis eligibility criteria sex and age provided by sors in analysis of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes all of them were considered while in insufficient physical activity only  questionnaires of participants without any kind of disability  comprehensive synthetic indicators were constructed  • complex indicator of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes was defined on the basis of several guidelines and recommendations  taking into account circumstances specific to slovenia cultural and economic and possibilities of the chm questionnaire complex indicator was derived on the basis of several questions of the cindi health monitor questionnaire on nutrition habits the containment of energy in foods was the most important criterion to select questions to be incorporated in this complex indicator all the most important components recommended by the who highfrequent intake of high energy density foods highfrequent intake of fats especially those composed of saturated fat acids highfrequent intake of sweet soft drinks  available in our database were taken into consideration  the participants were classified into three groups on the basis of the median value on the number of unhealthy components for the whole sample as follows healthy  components moderately unhealthy  components very unhealthy  components the prevalence of very unhealthy behaviour was observed  • complex indicator on the average level of physical activity was derived on the basis of several questions as well questions were basing on international physical activity questionnaire  as suggested by the cindi who they were taking into account different types of physical activity  moderate physical activity vigorous physical activity or walking according to type of physical activity and frequency frequency of at least times per week was considered as regular participants were classified into the following groups inactive irregularly active low intensity regularly active regular walking moderate intensity regularly active regular moderate physical activity and high intensity regularly active regular vigorous physical activity absence of physical activity and irregular physical activity of any type or intensity were considered as insufficient physical activity and any regular physical activity including regular walking which is one of popular types of regular physical activity in elderly in slovenia was considered as sufficient the prevalence of insufficient physical activity was observed the observed outcomes were related to sex age level of education employment social class selfclassification type of residence community and geographical region on the basis of the logistic regression model the riskscore for each participant was calculated and converted to the estimation of risk for the observed outcome all participants  were put in an array according to their risk estimate those with estimate values above the th percentile were classified in the veryhighrisk group the combinations of seven observed characteristics sex age education employment social class type of residence community and geographical region were then examined different combinations denoted different population groups’ profiles the most frequent profiles within the veryhighrisk groups were observed those ranked as top  were considered as convenient for public health ph actions  results very unhealthy nutrition related to obesity the highest odds ratios were observed in men aged  and  adults with lowest education level uncompleted or completed primary school heavy workers in rural economy people selfclassified in labour social class those living in rural communities and those living in eastern slovenia risk for this unhealthy behaviour was possible to estimate in  participants with data on all seven factors considered in the multivariate analysis  the highest estimated risk score value was  while the value of the th percentile was   participants were classified on or above this cutoff point in the veryhighrisk group for unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes profiles ranked on the top  ranking places according to frequency are presented in table  insufficient physical activity the highest odds ratios were observed in women aged  adults with lowest education level uncompleted primary school administrativeintellectual workers and job seekers people selfclassified in lowest social class those living in urban communities and those living in central slovenia the highest estimated risk score value was  while the value of the th percentile was   participants were classified on or above this cutoff point in the veryhighrisk group for insufficient physical activity profiles ranked on the top  ranking places the profiles on th and th place had the same frequency and both had to be considered according to frequency are presented in table  discussion on using the survey results as a tool in planning public health interventions with the abovedescribed methodology we succeeded to identify population groups at highest risk for two unhealthy behaviours related to chronic noncommunicable diseases • in unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes the worst situation was observed in eastern slovenia this was expected as on general the unhealthiest traditional lifestyle from the nutritional point of view was seen to be in eastern and the healthiest in western slovenia  this thesis was confirmed by the basic results on elements of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes as well • healthy nutrition habits eg consumption of sea food and olive oil were more expressed in western slovenia while unhealthy nutrition habits eg consumption of lard fried food or sweet soft drinks were most expressed in the most eastern part  the results indicated that from the ph point of view in unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes it was essential to start to intervene in eastern slovenia                   male male female male     vocational vocational primary primary primary uncompleted primary vocational

urban urban suburban central eastern central central western central • in insufficient physical activity there were many problems with interpretation of the results we do strongly believe that this was the obvious consequence of the questionnaire used  a short lastdays selfadministered format of ipaq is designed to observe at the same time vigorous and moderate physical  activity and walking of different sources leisure time activities housekeeping work physical activity at the workplace and transportation physical activity  with regards to the impact of regular and sufficiently intensive physical activity on human health this inevitably means mixedinformation data which are less applicable for such types of observations despite significant amounts of energy could be spent in some of the considered typesmodes of activity not all kinds of physical activity are equally healthy  often they could be even unhealthy vigorous physical activity in compulsory positions of the body for a longer time periods as it is the case in heavy physical workers in industry and rural economy could be extremely unhealthy while periodical vigorous physical activity during the leisure time could constitute both physical and psychological relaxation and is obviously healthy from the viewpoint solely to the daily expenditure of energy it is understandable that the situation with regular physical activity was shown as it is the best in eastern slovenia because the economy there is largely rural  on the contrary another more indepth survey cindi risk factors and process evaluation  survey which comprised also some elements of health examination survey and not only health interview survey in cooperation with a multisectorial and multidisciplinary research project “physical activity for health” showed that the prevalence of practicing regular leisuretime physical activity was the lowest in eastern slovenia in rural environments and in hard workers in rural economy  this indicated again that it was the priority to start with intervention programmes in the same part of the country with very similar population profiles as in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes on the basis of the results presented we can conclude that in view of future research on the impact of physical activity on health the part on physical activity in the cindi health monitor questionnaire at the international level has to be reassessed as a lot of countries have already experienced similar problems with the same set of questions  also we should try to assess the physical activity patterns of different population groups in the past as health condition in the present is mainly influenced by physical activity and nutrition habits in the past the results of this study combined with results of other cindi studies in slovenia confirmed that the situation in unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes and in leisuretime physical activity is the worst in eastern slovenia especially in pomurje indirectly the situation just described could be supported also by other results of the chm survey which showed that the percentage of obese adults body mass index ≥ was the highest in the pomurje  in contrast to  in most northwestern region nova gorica  changing the traditional lifestyle is one of the most important elements in reducing the unhealthy behaviours of different kind but extremely difficult as a process is long lasting and tightly bound to the political and economical situation of a country  in unfavourable socioeconomic circumstances the preservation of traditional lifestyle is endorsed and can be reduced only by strong multisectorial engagement  such conditions currently exist in eastern slovenia  but despite unfavourable socioeconomic circumstances in this region which could seriously affect the success of the ph interventions the multisectorial and multidisciplinary project »mura« which started in  in pomurje in only a couple of years offered several extremely positive results  it was a project based on intervention  programmes based on the pattern of a similar process in finland which proved as successful and effective  its development and implementation was strongly supported by the results of presented study with its unique methodology as well by the results of related studies numerous multisectorial activities including primary health prevention activities were focused on changing the nutritional and physical activity behaviour of the population and have been in process since the end  at the regional first in the pomurje region  as well as at the national level  with regard to health prevention activities specific socioeconomic and cultural circumstances were taken into consideration on the level of population groupsatrisk the concrete health promotion and health education approach was already applied in beltinci community in pomurje region  where the prevalence of many other unhealthy behaviours beside insufficient leisuretime physical activity and unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes is the highest  as well as combination of multiple risky behaviours  according to the first analysis of cindi health monitor survey  which serves as an efficiency evaluation tool for activities it was shown eg that prevalence of every day consumption of sweet soft drinks decreased from  in  to  in   the same study showed strong shift to more healthy behaviour also in use of fat for food preparation the percent of people using lard decreased from  in  to  in  while the percent of people using olive oil increased from  to  unfortunately the comparison in physical activity behaviour was impossible since in  the long lastdays selfadministered format of ipaq was used instead of the short lastdays selfadministered format  in order to distinguish between physical activity from different sources leisure time activities housekeeping work physical activity at the workplace and transportation physical activity conclusions the results of this study with its unique methodology proved to be powerful tool in development and implementation of an effective healthy nutrition and physical activity intervention programmes in slovenia as well as in robust assessment of their effectiveness and efficiency the information on the prevalence of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes and insufficient physical activity in slovenia even rough is very important for high quality health promotion and disease prevention planning at national or regional levels since these data provide information about the comprehensive dimensions of the problem in the community cindi and related surveys in developing other interventions for controlling noncommunicable diseases in adult population the results of above described study as well as of the other studies based on cindi methodology certainly serve as a basic knowledge of highquality and applicability in preparation of ph strategiesactivities in slovenia as well as in evaluation of their efficiency similar methodology as used in analysis and identification of population at risk for unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes and insufficient physical activity was used in different other unhealthy behaviours eg frequent perception of stress and in some diseaseshealth states as well eg musculoskeletal diseases and disorders a detailed description on cindi health monitor survey  results is available in an extensive survey report in slovene language for fund providers  ministry of education and  sports and ministry of health of republic of slovenia  this report is composed of several indepth studies on different unhealthy behaviours in slovene adults a short version is available in english language as well  some of indepth studies basing on cindi health monitor survey  database were published in domestic or international periodics mostly in english language additionally interregional differences in different health phenomena inside slovenia were possible to assess since the data enabled this kind of analyses chronologically these studies are as follows  the studies on interregional differences in health  and health behaviours   the study on identification of population groups at very high risk for frequent perception of stress  in english language  the study on identification of population groups with multiple hazardous health behaviours for cardiovascular diseases  in english language  the study on prevalence of selected musculoskeletal diseases and disorders in different population groups  in slovene language  the study on seatbelt use and nonuse in adults  in english language  the study on population groups at high risk for poor oral selfcare  in english language and  the study on selfrated health with emphasis on poor selfrated health  in english language also studies basing on cindi risk factors and process evaluation surveys data serve to the same purpose they are less numerous but not less important  the study on efficiency of cindi programme in controlling hypertension in adult population of ljubljana demonstrational level in year period  in english language and  the detailed study on prevalence of arterial hypertension its awareness and control in the adult population of the ljubljana area  in english language some other surveys were in the last years performed in slovenia as well the results were published only in slovene language so far  the study on effectiveness of beltici “let’s live healthy” project  in slovene language results of beltinci process evaluation surveys showed considerable improvement not only in health behaviours but also in some of the physiological risk factors the study was performed on  adults with monitoringobservation of health indicators on physiological risk factors before and after the intervention programme was carried out after only one year of intervention activities the average values of systolic blood pressure decreased by  diastolic blood pressure by  and blood cholesterol by  all differences were statistically highly significant this project was already spread from beltinci community to other parts of slovenia as a part of implementation of already mentioned nationwide strategy for prevention of cardiovascular diseases  the results are very promising and stimulative and people susceptible to them but sustainability is under the question as slovenia is still in the time of transition and the priorities are changing all the time  a multisectorial and multidisciplinary research project “physical activity for health”  in slovene language  this project was composed of several crosssectional studies in adult population as well as in children it was focused particularly in leisuretime physical activity as already mentioned results of this project showed that the prevalence of practicing regular leisuretime physical activity was the lowest in eastern slovenia in rural environments and in hard workers in rural economy exercises task  carefully read the part on

health decisionmaking • be aware that types of economic evaluation are more applicable in some areas of public health than in others • understand different possibilities of neural tube defects’ prevention • recognize public health benefits and potential adverse effects of folic acid food fortification • understand that the decision for folic acid food fortification its implementation and evaluation is a complex process where different professionals need to be fully involved and where economic evaluation needs to be introduced the central problem addressed by the discipline of economics is that of resource scarcity and so the purpose of economic evaluation is in a very broad sense to help decisionmakers when addressing problems arising due to the scarcity issue therefore such evidence is generated with the direct intention of influencing policy over recent years there have been repeated expressions of concern about the usefulness of health economic analyses and responses have tended to centre on questions of how research by health economists can be made more useful and accessible to policy makers how an economic evaluation can be used in practice is presented in the case of folic acid food fortification after the introduction of folate deficiency problem and discussion of strengths and weaknesses of folic acid food fortification it is demonstrated how an economic evaluation can add value to decisionmaking process however it is important to understand that even if the best possible economic evaluations were available they would be

for planning and evaluating public health interventions the case of folic acid food fortification jerneja farkašlainščak lijana zaletelkragelj theoretical background introduction decisionmaking is a crucial element in the field of medicine the physician has to determine what is wrong with the patient and recommend treatment while the patient has to decide whether or not to seek medical care and go along with the treatment recommended by the physician decisionmaking is vital component of public health as well health policy makers and health insurers have to decide what to promote what to discourage and what to pay for together these decisions determine the quality of health care that is provided therefore public health and health care policymakers need a trustworthy source of evidence on which to build health policy world health organization who regional office for europe brought out at the fourth futures forum of highlevel decisionmakers entitled tools for decisionmaking in public health which was held in brussels in   several important conclusions among which two could be pointed out as most important ones  the need for evidencebased decisions and as a consequence evidencebased recommendations has never been greater and that  the use of evidence enables decisionmakers to be transparent and explicit about the basis for decisions at the same time we should be aware that   evidence changes with time and the utility of evidencebased recommendations is therefore time limited  the speed of decisionmaking does not always allow time for the generation and use of evidence  evidencebased decisions may not always be acceptable to the public and this will inevitably be a consideration in taking publichealth decisions and in determining policy  a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of an intervention does not mean that the intervention is necessarily ineffective it may be that the research has yet to be undertaken  interventions known to be successful in improving population health can fail if the necessary organizational capacity is not made available to ensure their success implementation factors such as finance skills and organizational capacity are therefore an essential part of the evidence review process  in the frame of who regional office for europe a body entitled health evidence network hen was established aiming at giving rapid access to independent and reliable health information and evidence  nowadays medical as well as public health decisionmaking is a rapidly expanding field that includes different quantitative theoretical tools for modelling decisions psychological research on how decisions are actually made and applied research on how decisionmaking can be improved economic evaluation is one of these tools economic evaluation as a tool for public health decisionmaking health care resources are limited and where how and when to allocate them are the main questions if we want the health care system to be efficient we all agree that this issue is extremely complicated the situation is even more complicated when in this story public health especially disease prevention and health promotion is placed health economic through economic evaluation can give some answers to this set of questions the central problem addressed by the discipline of economics is that of resource scarcity and so the purpose of economic evaluation is in a very broad sense to help decisionmakers when addressing problems arising due to the scarcity issue therefore such evidence is generated with the direct intention of influencing policy over recent years there have been repeated expressions of concern about the usefulness of health economic analyses and responses have tended to centre on questions of how research by health economists can be made more useful and accessible to policy makers  the increasing need for economic evidence to inform policy decisions but the inevitable limits on the rate at which such studies can be undertaken and published has raised questions about the extent to which the conclusions of a given study undertaken for one specific context hold true for others this has also stimulated interest in new methods to assess quantitatively the extent of variability in results and to make adjustments across contexts recent developments in economic evaluation concerning public health in recent years there have been some important developments in economic evaluation concerning public health  the first important development has been its increasing prominence in public health decisionmaking although there is continued uncertainty about the role of economic evaluation studies in decisionmaking at the level of individual hospitals and health authorities  a number of health care systems are now using economic evaluation to make systemlevel decisions about which interventions to fund from collective resources  economic evidence has been used for some years in australia and canada to establish whether new pharmaceuticals represent a costeffective use of the resources available to the public health care system  more recently a number of european countries have developed an economic dimension to the regulation of health care technologies including portugal  sweden and finland  even in the usa the need to ensure efficient use of collective health care resources has led some health maintenance organisations to use formal economic criteria in decisionmaking about which interventions will cover   the second development is the emergence of new economic evaluation methods in particular areas these include alternative approaches to handling uncertainty in the context of studies based on patientlevel data eg randomised trials and in decision models and preferencebased measures of health status which link data on patients’ health states as collected in trials and similar studies with the public’s health state preferences to facilitate estimates of qalys  there remain however a number of important sources of controversy in the field for example the role and methods of productivity cost estimation and how to reflect equity considerations in economic evaluation  one area of methodology on which much has been written but in which few new methods have emerged relates to the generalisability of economic evaluation  the proposal put forward is that the objective of health care services should be to maximise population health benefits  for many this appears not to be a highly controversial suggestion and in broad terms receives support from policy makers and the public more generally  the difficulties and disputes arise primarily around attempts to measure health how to make valuation of health in economic analyses over the course of the last  years or so the subdiscipline of health economics has had a methodological focus on the measurement and valuation of health the result is a measure of health that can be operationalised for use in policy making ie the qualityadjusted lifeyear qaly or qualityadjusted life expectancy qale  the decision rule therefore for normative health economic analyses is to advocate investment in those technologies that produce the largest qaly gains for a given level of cost in order to inform such decisions normative analyses tend to provide results in the form of the incremental costeffectiveness ratios icer netbenefit statistics and costeffectiveness acceptability curves ceac  the icer reports the ratio of additional costs to additional health effects associated with a new intervention eg cost per qaly gained  the netbenefit statistic expresses the additional health effects in monetary units by using an estimate of the “maximum willingness to pay” per unit of health gain where available  the ceac plots the probability that the intervention in question is costeffective against threshold values to define costeffectiveness  the role of economic analyses in public health decisions yet while economic evaluation is often of little help in deciding whether to undertake an intervention in the first place it has rather more potential in helping to decide which of a series of options should be chosen to achieve a specified goal by means of costeffectiveness analysis while recognizing the potential benefits of costeffectiveness analysis it should also be noted that it is more applicable in some  areas of public health than in others  for instance secondary prevention initiatives like screening for example have been subject to numerous costeffectiveness analyses to help choose between different methods of screening or target groups however primary prevention has been subject to rather less economic evaluation to date in part due to the difficulties of measuring costs and effects and determining causation recent review by allin and colleagues describes the models of public health decisionmaking in eight countries denmark finland france germany netherlands sweden australia and canada it has been written to inform the debate on future policy options and it represents an initial attempt to map prioritysetting in public health  this investigation revealed that none of the eight countries has explicit systematic procedures for making decisions affecting public health or setting priorities among different public health interventions the methodology used for making decisions and setting priorities in public health across the eight countries is consistently related to population health status epidemiological data burden of disease and often scope for prevention also important in this process are political negotiations pressure from interest groups and informal processes in addition to the other methods sweden bases decisions on an “ethical framework” encompassing human dignity need and solidarity likewise france highlights the importance of ensuring that decisions fit with societal values australia and the netherlands increasingly are utilizing economic evaluation and evidence of interventions’ effectiveness to guide decisionmaking in this way they are progressing more rapidly towards creating an evidencebased policy environment  however it is important to understand that even if the best possible economic evaluations were available they would be only one element in a complex process of decisionmaking that is also shaped by scientific evidence and political feasibility like every analytical tool also economic analysis has its limitations and not at the end also the public health decisions should to the reasonable extent keep in touch with society’s health values  comprehensive example would be a case of folic acid food fortification case study case of folic acid food fortification as an example of public health decisionmaking prevention of neural tube defects neural tube defects ntd are a group of heterogenous and complex congenital anomalies of the central nervous system resulting from failure of normal neural tube closure between the third and fourth week of embryonic development  each year approximately  pregnancies in the european union result in a livebirth stillbirth or termination of pregnancy of an infant affected by ntd mainly spina bifida and anencephaly  all infants with anencephaly are stillborn or die shortly after birth whereas many infants with spina bifida have substantially enhanced survival rate thanks to recent improvements in medical and surgical management however these individuals continue to be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality throughout their life as they face severe lifelong disabilities and are at risk for psychosocial maladjustment their medical  problems may result from the neurologic defect itself or from its repair eg paralysis hydrocephalus endocrine abnormalities deformations of the limbs and spine bladder bowel or sexual dysfunction and learning disabilities  in addition to the emotional cost of spina bifida the estimated monetary cost is staggering in the united states alone the total cost of spina bifida over a lifetime the direct costs of medical developmental and educational services and the indirect costs associated with morbidity and mortality in  dollars for affected infants born in  was almost  million or  for each infant  recently centers for disease control and prevention published data about average cost of caring for a child born with spina bifida for life which is about   ntd develop within the first few weeks of embryogenesis at a time before many women know that they are pregnant studies of smithells and colleagues  confirmed by many other studies and randomized clinical trials by the early ’s  showed that supplements containing folic acid when consumed around the time of conception and early in pregnancy can reduce ntd by an estimated  or more it is generally accepted that prevention can be obtained at a dose corresponding to  µg of folic acid per day three different strategies are available to reach the daily dose women may consume a diet rich in folate they may take supplements with folic acid or consume foods fortified with folic acid because folic acid is inexpensive safe and easy to use many professional organizations and some governmental agencies promote the use of folic acid supplements to prevent ntd  the format of such recommendations varies but they typically include statements that women should eat a healthy diet and take folic acid supplements when planning a pregnancy or throughout childbearing age in a few countries including the united states canada chile and south africa recommendations to consume folic acid are integrated with a policy of widespread fortification of flour to ensure that the entire population receives at least a small additional amount of folic acid regardless of access to supplements  a crucial question is how effective are recommendations alone in the absence of fortification a study was conducted by the eurocat working group to review progress in the last decade in european countries in terms of developing and implementing public health policies to raise periconceptional folate status and analyze data on the prevalence of ntd to determine the extent to which ntd have been prevented up to the year   representatives from  countries participating in eurocat provided information about policy health education campaigns and surveys of folic acid supplement uptake in their country surveys showed that in all countries a minority of women were taking supplements during the entire advised periconceptional period with supplementation rates varying from  to  between countries the situation regarding lack or low uptake of supplementation advice is reflected in the lack of a clear decline in the prevalence of ntd across europe authors concluded that the potential for preventing ntd by periconceptional folic acid supplementation is still far from being fulfilled in europe  the most likely possibility is that recommendations were not implemented to the point of inducing a sustained change in behavior in a sufficiently large proportion of women to cause measurable effects  whereas any improvement in primary prevention is  desirable and should be promoted a detectable change in the population requires a major shift in the proportion of women consuming adequate amounts of folic acid it is unclear how successful recommendations alone will be in achieving this goal given the influence of cultural social and economic factors such as the acceptability availability and cost of daily supplements in general use of supplements tends to follow economic and educational lines so targeting the entire population through recommendations on supplementation alone may not be practical  only a public health policy including folic acid fortification of staple foods is likely to avoid widening socioeconomic inequalities in ntd prevalence and result in large scale prevention of ntd  in view of the findings that there has been a lack of substantial decline in ntd prevalence in europe since  and even countries which have pursued supplementation policies relatively actively have found a limited preventive impact eurocat has issued the following recommendations  countries should review their policies regarding folic acid fortification and supplementation taking account of who europe recommendations  european countries could prevent most neural tube defects in planned pregnancies by putting in place an official policy recommending periconceptional folic acid supplementation and taking steps to ensure that the population are aware of the benefits of supplementation and the importance of starting supplementation before conception  as many pregnancies are unplanned european countries could achieve more effective prevention of neural tube defects by additionally introducing fortification of a staple food with folic acid the particular objectives of this policy would be preventing neural tube defects among women who do not plan their pregnancy and reducing socioeconomic inequalities in neural tube defect prevalence  health effects of supplementation and fortification should be monitored and policies should be reviewed periodically in light of the findings  the european population should be covered by high quality congenital malformation registers which collect information about affected pregnancies live births stillbirths and terminations for fetal abnormality one important use for the information would be to assess the effect of folic acid supplementation and fortification on ntd rates as well as rates of other congenital malformations  folic acid food fortification – pro et contra in this context fortification of flour represents an additional opportunity to deliver some folic acid to nearly the entire population across social and economic barriers where dietary and food processing conditions are favorable fortification can be effective quickly and at low cost  in countries that have fortified flour blood folate concentrations have risen quickly and although the reductions in incidence were not as large as that achievable through supplementation such reduction occurred soon after fortification was implemented  in  the united states public health service issued a recommendation that all women of childbearing age should consume  µg of folic acid per day to reduce the risk of having an infant with an ntd  the institute of medicine  made a similar recommendation in  suggesting that women of childbearing age should consume  µg of folic acid per day from fortified foods supplements or both in addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet  in  the united states food and drug administration fda folic acid subcommittee recommended that folic acid fortification be implemented to ensure that  of women of childbearing age consume  µg folate daily or folic acid from all sources but the fda did not implement fortification at the level required to achieve this because of safety considerations  the fda began requiring folic acid fortification of enriched cerealgrain products in  at a level  µg  g that was estimated to provide an average person approximately  µg additional folic acid daily  on november   fortification with folic acid of all types of white flour enriched pasta and cornmeal became mandatory in canada with the goal to increase by approximately  to  the average intake of folic acid among women of childbearing age without posing a risk to the general public  in any case average serum folate concentrations increased significantly after the implementation of folic acid fortification and the prevalence of ntd in the united states in  was  lower than that before folic acid fortification  in canada a – decrease in ntd was seen to coincide with folic acid food fortification  although the primary goal of folic acid fortification is to reduce the occurrence of ntd in women of reproductive age the potential benefit to the general population in reducing the risk of chronic disease via homocysteine lowering is also highly relevant  recently published populationbased study suggests that the temporal decline in strokerelated mortality in the united states and canada coincided with the introduction of folic acid fortification  more importantly a metaanalysis of clinical trials just published shows that supplementation with folic acid reduced the risk of stroke by  overall by  in trials with a treatment duration of less than  months and by  in those trials in subjects with no history of stroke which strongly suggests that either folic acid or homocysteine lowering plays a role in the primary prevention of stroke  populationbased exposure to folic acid through fortification however is controversial because of concerns about potential adverse effects on health the most widely documented concern is the possibility that highdose folic acid may mask the diagnosis and thereby delay the treatment of vitamin b deficiency in older adults  in addition there is some concern that highdose folic acid may promote the development of colorectal cancer if precancerous lesions or neoplasms are already established in the mucosa  thus mandatory fortification with folic acid remains virtually nonexistent in europe furthermore although many european countries allow the addition of nutrients to foods on a voluntary basis ie at the manufacturer’s discretion others prohibit fortification of any kind thus national fortification policy varies considerably throughout the european union  the european commission however is aiming in the near future to regulate in its member states the minimum and maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals allowed to be added to foodstuffs   economic evaluation of folic acid food fortification economic evaluation plays an important role in translating research findings into practice and policy economic evaluations can be exante conducted before the adoption of a policy on the basis of results from pilot studies and theoretical assumptions or expost carried out after implementation using information on observed outcomes before the adoption of fortification in united states  independent economic evaluations concluded that folic acid fortification at  µg of folic acid per  g of cereal grain product would yield net economic benefits or cost savings  this conclusion was confirmed and strengthened by postfortification analysis where grosse and colleagues calculated the economic impact of fortification using both cost–benefit and costeffectiveness analytic techniques on the basis of prefortification and postfortification epidemiological data  they believe that folic acid fortification has proven to be a public health success in the united states and canada although an economic evaluation of fortification in canada has yet to be conducted the net benefit and cost savings surpass estimates prepared before fortification by any measure folic acid fortification provides a remarkable return on investment other industrialized countries could benefit by following the lead of the united states and canada in adopting folic acid fortification of cerealgrain products  furthermore the benefits of fortification are not restricted to higherincome countries wheat flour folic acid fortification program in chile showed an increase in blood folate levels and a  decrease in the risk of ntd  llanos and colleagues conducted expost economic evaluation findings of which strongly support the continuation of fortification of wheat flour with folic acid in chile furthermore these findings serve as important evidence for policy makers from other countries to consider the implementation of folic acid fortification of cereal grain products  due to uncertain risks the dutch health council advised the government against fortifying food with folic acid in   their conclusions were based on uncertain risk suggested above in particular the elderly population would be at risk for excess intake of folic acid which was considered to be highly undesirable jentink and colleagues produced estimations of the costs savings health gains costeffectiveness and costutility for bulk food fortification with  µg folic acid per  g flour  estimations were conducted in a base case analysis presenting the most likely situation and in sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions they applied the societal perspective for economic analysis which included the whole spectrum of direct indirect medical and nonmedical costs their model suggested that folic acid fortification of bulk food to prevent cases of ntd might be a costsaving intervention in the netherlands as well  exercises task  individually carefully read the theoretical part of this module and recommended readings  task  make two groups for discussion using method “pro et contra” the group no prepares arguments for “pros” and the group no for “contras” perform the “pro et contra” discussion in a limited time task  fortification of food with folic acid has the potential to reach a large proportion of the population and increase the level of folate consumed some governments in europe are now seriously considering folic acid food fortification what information would you need to support this public health policy in your own country make a short written report and present it to your colleagues task  discuss the fortification of food with folic acid issue in a plenary session

completing this module students and public health professionals should • be aware of methods for patients satisfaction and expectations of hospital care assessment • recognise the particular dimensions of quality of care • increase knowledge of different aspects of patient satisfaction and experiences of hospital care • differentiate the aspects of patient satisfaction with hospital health services • identified problems related to patients experiences with hospital care supply • improve the knowledge and understanding of patient needs and expectations of inpatient hospital care as well as the necessity of applying for such investigations abstract there is an increasing interest in eliciting feedback from patients to highlight aspects of care that need improvement and to monitor performance and quality of care hospitals increasingly need to adopt a patientcentred attitude traditionally assessments have ignored the reports of patients in preference to technical and physiological reports of outcome healthcare systems have sought to achieve a balance in services that offer not only clinically effective and evidence based care but which are also judged by patients as acceptable and beneficial questionnaires that ask patients to rate their care in terms of how satisfied they are tend to elicit very positive ratings which are not sensitive to problems with the specific processes that affect the quality of care delivery a more valid approach is to ask patients to report in detail on their  teaching methods specific recommendations for teachers assessment of students satisfaction and experiences by asking them specific questions about whether or not certain processes and events occurred during the course of a specific episode of care this type of questionnaire can provide results that can be easily interpreted and acted upon building on extensive qualitative research to determine which aspects of care are important to patients we used

trendafilova kiril kirilov theroretical background patients satisfaction and experiences of hospital care background evaluation of healthcare provision is essential in the ongoing assessment and consequent quality improvement of medical services traditionally assessments have ignored the reports of patients in preference to technical and physiological reports of outcome more recently however healthcare systems have sought to achieve a balance in services that offer not only clinically effective and evidence based care but which are also judged by patients as acceptable and beneficial  health care which improves health only in some limited technical sense but does not improve the quality or length of life is not likely to be viewed as beneficial by patients  governments and regulatory authorities in some countries now require hospitals to organize patient surveys at regular intervals interest has therefore grown not only in the assessment of treatment interventions by patients but in the systematic evaluation of the delivery of that care  most significantly attempts have been made to determine the features of patient care that are likely to influence patient satisfaction patient satisfaction is not a clearly defined concept although most typically it appears to represent attitudes to care or aspects of care  while numerous questionnaires have been developed which ask people to rate aspects of care such an approach has limitations attitudes to services do not tell us very much about the nature of those services surveys of patient satisfaction tend to elicit very positive ratings which are not sensitive to specific problems in the quality of care delivery it has been argued that questionnaires should attempt to measure patients’ experiences of their care and then determine how such experiences are related to satisfaction  questionnaires that ask patients to rate their care in terms of how satisfied they are tend to elicit very positive ratings which are not sensitive to problems with the specific processes that affect the quality of care delivery  a more valid approach is to ask patients to report in detail on their experiences by asking them specific questions about whether or not certain processes and events occurred during the course of a specific episode of care this type of questionnaire can provide results that can be easily interpreted and acted upon  the results of a round of studies show that more meaningful information is gained when patients are asked to report on specific aspects of their experience of care it has been suggested that age and health status are major influences on patient satisfaction  authors from the picker institute of oxford have published series of papers which show that age is an important factor in reported satisfaction but self  reported health status was not however the most important determinants as indicated by the regression models appear to be physical comfort emotional support and respect for patient preferences  the aim of patients’ satisfaction reports is to allow insureespatients on one hand and physicians and medical personnel on the other hand to make an informed choice of hospitals based on quality indicators hence over the past decade there has been increasing realization of the need to take into account patient reports of their hospital experiences in the development of action plans for improvement of services safety and care provided it is suggested that efforts to improve health care will be wasted unless they reflect what patients want from the service  a variety of methods have therefore been employed to assess the patients preferences for care evaluations of what occurred or factual reports of care examples are questionnaires to assess patients needs and surveys among patients to provide feedback to care providers or the public  development of newer tools and techniques to assess patient opinion is an emerging trend around the globe highlighting the need for providers of hospital care to assess and improve the quality of care they offer and to continue expanding their use of questionnaires and surveys  figure  proposed conceptual framework for hcqi project source kelley e hurst j oecd health working papers delsaheawdhwp   patients needs a number of countries have asked for the specification of the conceptual framework which should guide the development of an international set of health care quality indicators at the oecd the framework below presents a visual summary of the dimensions of health care performance including quality access cost efficiency and equity it also presents a visual picture of factors related to but distinct from health system performance such as health system design policy and context nonhealth care determinants of health and overall levels of health it highlights the particular dimensions of quality of care that will be the focus on the hcqi project namely effectiveness safety and responsiveness patient centeredness  case study the case of bulgaria bulgarian hospitals must adopt appropriate marketbased approaches in order to survive and serve to the public health needs national health insurance fund is a typical example for imperfect provider market in bulgaria monopoly is at the opposite extreme of the competitive spectrum from perfect competition in a monopolistic market like obligatory health insurance in bulgaria there is a single provider who because of a lack of competition from several other providers can influence price such a situation is allocatively inefficient bulgarian hospitals in the environment of health insurance system tend to be more efficient due to financial constraints than a few years ago in the environment of governmental budgetary financing still there is a recognition that the delivery of health care is ineffective and inefficient and that these unpleasant outcomes are a product of the perverse incentives inherent of the ex health care system patients experiences of hospital care in bulgaria a study is required to survey patients opinions of general aspects of inpatient care provided to them during admission such a study becomes even more important in light of the limited budget allocation to the health sector and the inability of many patients to afford expensive treatment modalities hence there is further need to prioritize spending and this study hopes to fill this void by production of data that can help managers and doctors to identify and address unsatisfactory factors in the care they provide  building on extensive qualitative research to determine which aspects of care are important to patients we used standardized instrument to measure the quality of care in relation to problems identified as a result of inpatient stay in hospital in bulgaria the purpose of this study was to measure patients’ experiences of hospital care in bulgaria and to identify existing problems with health services supply and inpatient  stay the study design could be used to make comparisons between different hospitals within the country or abroad and for monitoring trends over time a questionnaire of items is used developed for use in inpatient surveys undertaken by the picker institute of europe for the purposes of assessing the quality of care ppe   became an important tool in the processes of monitoring and improving quality of health care services each item in the questionnaire is coded for statistical analysis as a dichotomous ‘problem score’ indicating the presence or absence of a problem a problem is defined as an aspect of health care that could in the eyes of the patient be improved upon a total of  patients response rate   filled the questionnaire as a part of a pilot study patients’ experiences in bulgaria were at a lower level comparable to european surveys for most aspects of hospital care table  problems identified from inpatient stay in bulgarian hospitals values shown are percentages item                problem doctors’ answers to questions not clear nurses’ answers to questions not clear staff gave conflicting information doctors didn’t discuss anxieties or fears doctors sometimes talked as if the patient wasn’t there patients were not sufficiently involved in decisions about their treatment and care not always treated with respect and dignity nurses didn’t discuss anxieties or fears not easy to find someone to talk to about concerns staff didn’t do enough to control pain families didn’t get enough opportunities to talk to doctors families didn’t get enough information needed to help recovery purpose of medicines that patients have to take at home not explained patients weren’t told about medication side effects patients weren’t told about danger signals to look for at home frequency      response rate                            results the results of this study have shown that a significant majority of patients reported they were not told of the side effects of medications given to them    the percentage of patients who never received clear answers to their questions from nurses was pretty high   comparing to the studies undertaken in other european countries where this percentage was significantly lower the explanation of that result can be attributed in part to a lack of knowledge of the nurses or the fact that patients may be asking questions from them that should normally be addressed to doctors the study shows that compared to developed countries a higher number of patients had to wait too long after pressing the call bell before a nurse attended to them   of the patients received conflicting information from the staff while in other studies this percentage is   the percentage of patients who wanted greater involvement in their care was much higher   than the percentage in the western countries   of the patients felt that their families were not given enough opportunity to talk to the doctors the results from our study show that   of the patients did not find easily anyone in the staff to talk to about their worries and fears while   didn’t discuss anxieties or fears with doctors more than one third felt that the amount of information provided was not enough this is despite the fact that all patients are required to sign an informed consent form before all the procedure too high is the percentage of people that reported persistent pain and they thought that the staff didn’t do enough to control their pain   conclusions ppe   provides basic information and other optional questions can be added scores are easy to interpret and can be action upon it consists of a minimum dataset of issues that are important to patients the patients’ experiences presented here indicate that many patients with inpatient hospital stay in bulgaria did not receive optimal care applications of this survey instrument could be used to monitor these basic aspects of hospital care over time which are expected to lead to a quality improvement of hospital care in bulgaria patients should be provided with more information during their stay at hospitals doctors as well as nurses need to improve their communication with patients the health care team should provide more emotional support to patients so that they get at least someone in the staff with whom they can talk about their concerns the staff should make sure that they explain all the risks and benefits to patients and patiently listen and answer their questions before getting the informed consent form signed for every procedure finally there has to be much more efforts for pain control in order to provide better health services for patients and to receive feedback about their views on the care provided in conclusion the ppe –  represents a step forward in the measurement of patient experience enabling the comparison of hospital performance and the establishment of national and international benchmarks  many sections of patient care require considerable improvement in order to provide better quality of health care services in bulgaria compared to other european countries subjective health status measures are used to assess the impact of medicine on the wellbeing of patients feedback on patients’ experiences of health care is sought in order to determine priorities for quality improvement measurement of patients’ experiences is also seen as an important component of performance assessment exercise task  explain the purpose of the studies that are focused on patients experiences and satisfaction task  which are

students’ work –  case problem presentations  economic assessment and management of process of ageing in bulgaria jasmine pavlova theoretical background introduction seventeen years ago in the republic of bulgaria has started an accession from centralized planning to market oriented economy and one year yet bulgaria is a full member of the european union the current bulgarian economy can be described following some specific operational market relations completed structural changes achieved macroeconomic stability availability of market institutions in all spheres of the public life the consequences of these changes have substantial economic and social dimensions the beginning of twentyfirst century was marked with successes and difficulties for the bulgarian society the basis laid in the end of the last century develops at a good pace during the last  years bulgaria rated about  growth of the gross domestic product gdp according to the official data the unemployment dropped to  but yet its distribution by regions remained still uneven the country is affiliate of the european union one year yet in order to let bulgarians feel themselves europeans not only de jure but also de facto it is necessary to follow a sustainable overtaking development of the economy which by the means of the figures means maintenance of not less than  of gdp for about  year the condition of the population though provokes serious anxiety and raises multiple problems to be solved bulgaria is not an exception from the other european countries when comparing the negative phenomena in the demographic development of the population in distinction to them these tendencies are much more extreme and of much stronger impact to the social systems therefore it was considered that training of students health and social professionals as well as aged people in managing the new economic and social life realities and acquaintance with the natural psychosomatic changes of age advancing is of urgent importance corresponding to training targets and problematic areas the following programme themes were selected − information on specific diseases of third age − possibilities for protection and reduction of disease complications − stressogenic factors in the third age − motor regime and healthy nutrition − adaptation of behaviour based on the living and social experience − demographic ageing and economic consequences − retirement pensioning systems european experience − application of market approaches for improvement of the third age people’s living standard − basic knowledge in information and computer technologies  demographic aging in bulgaria bulgaria is not an exception from the other european countries when it concerns the processes of demographic development of the population differing from the other eu countries processes here are much more extreme and with much higher impact on the social systems the study of population goes back quite a long way after the liberation in  the third bulgarian state was established and the interest to the population increased due to the necessity of statistical data labour force and overall development of the new country factors and reasons determining the growth of the population in bulgaria are complex biological social economic ethic and others in  according to the census of the population in bulgarian principality there were  people and in  in eastern rumelia there were  after the union of eastern rumelia with the bulgarian principality in  the population exceeded  millions the peak of the growth of bulgarian population was in  when it reaches nearly  millions people after this it begins to decrease due to many factors analyzing the data of table  we can mention some important tendencies decreasing of total population and people under labour age and increasing of townspeople and aged and old population in the country the migration from villages to towns is a global process in european countries and bulgaria is not an exception towns offer jobs and higher standard of life that is why they attract many people mostly young generations gradually villages become depopulated the agriculture falls into a crisis because of the lack of young labour force  table  demographic status of bulgarian population years of census total population percentage of townspeople percentage percentage percentage of people of people in of people below labour labour age over labour age age                                                            sources nsi   un population division desa according to prognosis data the ageing of population is seen as one of the major challenges to the bulgarian society and economy in the beginning of th century people under labour age were  those over labour age were  the birthrate was ‰ the general mortality rate – ‰ the children mortality  ‰ the natality in bulgaria was high till  and it determined the high level of natural growth the  country has a model of “young population” for a period of nearly fifty years after  the decrease of natality changes constantly the demographic structure of the population the changes in correlations between groups of people over and under labour age show that the demographic ageing of the population begins about  this tendency was manifested continuously until  when the relative share of old people was  bulgaria converts into the group of countries with demographic model “old population” the last year’s data show decreasing of natality and increasing of mortality the natural growth is negative it is the greatest demographic fall in bulgaria except periods of balkan and first world wars these processes intensify the deformations in age structure of the population and decrease the life and labour potential of the country bulgaria relatively quickly passes the four stages of the demographic transition the first period until  is characterized with high levels of natality and mortality the generations change each other very rapidly the middle duration of life was  years  the second period comprehends years  the natural growth of the population was reduced considerably more than twice table  table

world war the natality was ‰ the mortality  ‰ after  the second stage of the demographic transition continued till the middle of the s when the natality reached ‰ the mortality – ‰ and the natural

the end of this period the netcoefficient for reproduction of the population decreases less than  this is a sign for the beginning of the fourth stage of the demographic transition the indexes of natality and mortality approximated and the natural growth of the population in  was – ‰ already we have to note that this transition proceeded at accelerated rates in bulgaria during  years while this process continued more than a century in european countries from the beginning of  bulgaria felt in a condition of depopulation the average life expectancy had increased from  years male –  female –  in  to  years male –  female –    very often the notion “old population” is connected to longlife of the nation the publication of statistic for longlivers in bulgaria creates an idea that the country  is a one with old population but the demographic ageing is not identical with the category “longlife” it measures the biosocial stability of the population in certain groups the phenomenon “longlife” is typical for nations with “young population” model and inversely there are a few longlivers in regions with old population according to the classic rule higher longevity is observed in countries and regions with high percentage of old people we couldn’t confirm this in bulgaria in regions with old population the number of longlivers is considerably smaller than this one in regions with younger population in the case of bulgaria there is a direct correlation between the number of longlivers and the high birthrate such are districts of smolian kardjali and blagoevgrad st vizev a hadjihristev the correlation between sexes is from  female male  to  female male  according to the un prognoses in  the inequity will increase  female male in a large part the greater number of women is due to the higher mortality and higher migration among men in the past the age structure of bulgarian population was progressive that is to say the age pyramid was with a large foundation and little by little narrowed increasing the age later the basis of the pyramid was equal to the middle part nowadays the deformation continues as it is shown in the figure  age pyramid of bulgarian population  the age structure of the bulgarian population is of regressive type which is also influenced by the emigration of young people mainly the foundation of the pyramid narrows on contrary its middle and upper part extend  development of the bulgarian economy after  the period  is specified with a transition from planned and centralized to market economy where the basis of the free competition among economic entities is laid  and the prices of goods and services are being defined from the market’s demand and offering this period of transition was hampered by the inherited negatives of the economic cultural and political life as a result and comparing to the other countries of the eastern europe the country slowed down the processes of privatization and reimbursement of lands and respectively its integration in nato and the eu during the period about  entities were privatized some  before  a main part of the privatized subjects is municipal property as the state property represents only  at the end of  there were  active economic entities from which  were state  – municipal and the rest of it – private almost  of these economic entities were registered in the capital about  in the region of plovdiv the latter reflects the regional differences of work occupation which is due to both traditions and local conditions during the same period the volume of gdp per capita changed from  in  up to  in  during  it dropped down to  comparison of this criteria shows that gdp in bulgaria is more than  times lower than in norway denmark luxemburg or any other developed country industrial production also decreases as in  it represents only  of ’s volume the main fall off concerned branches strongly dependent on expensive import row materials machine building ferrous metallurgy etc this decrease continued during the next year as well meanwhile a rapid increase of private owned share in the industry was  registered as in  it reached  about  of the

unstable markets for realization of the production  fig  age pyramid source wwweurowhoint legend жени – female мъҗе – male г – year after  started a long and tormenting process for restitution of

in a separate chapter  the external trade balance of bulgaria is negative for years nevertheless it is quite encouraging that the increase of export rates is higher than those of import table  main factor for increase of the real income during the last years is the expanding of the economic liberty it is related to the implementation of the currency board ensuring relative stability of the bulgarian lev as well as the privatizing of most of the state enterprises liberalization of some of the branches and removal of barriers before the new participants on the market reduction of obstacles in external commerce like decrease of duties and tariff limitations all these improve the potential for longterm growth as the goal is to encourage the individual initiative and personal responsibility due to a strong dependency on natural conditions climate change and lower sustainability of the sorts a drop down of agricultural production was recorded during  the logical expectations for this year is that yield will be insufficient again this year and according to the official data the net added value nav from the agricultural sector will drop down with  real expression notwithstanding that the share of this sector in the total added value becomes lower and lower such a sharp decrease leads to slow down of the general growth increased subsidies from european funds do not yet have results this will effect in more expectations for state support as part of the funding will be targeted only for maintenance of the land and not for cultivation instead of effective production and generation of profits therefore no high improvements are to be expected during the next years and dependency on climatic conditions will become deeper and deeper  situation in the other sectors looks more positive the real growth of the nav in the industry reaches  and  for the services  relatively lower  remain the correctives which include net taxes on products and indirectly measured services of the financial brokers concerning expenditures a slight tendency for increase of the gdp share in the investments measured through gross conversion into fixed capital it reaches  on annual basis this is a precondition for increase of the potential economic growth in near future on another hand the gross savings in economy decrease up to  annual basis though the share of end consumption in the gdp decreases this is a result from lower net current transfers and lower net income the reasons could be found in the increased volume of foreign investments in the country which are due to interest fees and increasing dividends from another part the increased income in the country and the immigration of whole families abroad leads to smaller foreign transfers  as a whole data for gross domestic product development are positive certain delay of the economic development is due to the ineffective agriculture most probably the emerging of new actors on the market for example the funds for agricultural lands would result in land consolidation and consequently – to long term opportunities for generation of profits it might be expected though that upcoming subsidies would distort farmers’ incentives and decline their attention from increasing of the efficiency to drafting of applications with unclear final results subsidies for agricultural sector shall come from the european budget in total and moneys from bulgarian taxpayers shall be reduced to minimum another negative factor for the development of the economy is the hidden economy which by its nature represents quite a complex socialeconomic phenomenon practically it concerns all publiceconomical structures on international national and regional level following the expert evaluations the relative share of the hidden economy amounts at  of the world’ gdp making such evaluation is very difficult and it is conditional in some sense table  for bulgaria this “product” varies between  and  problems causing this phenomenon are multiple payment of labour becomes nonmonitored and undeclared income for both employee and employers production from it is not taxed added value tax income tax etc hidden economy operates with two very serious tools smuggling and drugtraffic  from the variety of scenarios concerning the economic future of central and eastern european countries for the period until  and  according to some economy experts from bulgarian academy of science bulgaria can chose two extreme versions for development  − slow down of the development with about  average annual rate of the gdp growth or slow development with about  average annual rate this means that following the first scenario by the middle of the century we will have  gdp per capita from the ec average level by that time or  following the second scenario such projections mean that will cause to bulgaria socialeconomic stagnation with heavy strategic consequences table  − overtaking or quick overtaking economic development with  average annual rate of the gdp growth in order to realize economic overtaking it is necessary to have an annual growth  times higher than the growth of the countries in ec in this case we will reach  gdp up to  and  of the growth of ec by  such favourable prospective for bulgaria is possible but not sure   table  real gdp growth rate  –              eu  countries eu

maintenance of relatively stable level of the incomes from family farm was registered incomes from entrepreneurship in  increased with   compared to  a tendency for reduction of incomes generated from real estate sales the expenditures structure shows that most significant expenditures were made for food – about  something typical for the countries with low life standard consumption of food products is characterized with poor relative share of the fruits and vegetables  living standard of bulgarian population improves but still remains one of the lowest in europe pensioning system significant demographic problems in bulgaria emigration of young people great number of pensioners and the high unemployment rate brought an inevitable necessity  of reform in the pensioning system the way of financing was changed first of all the treepillars pensioning system was implemented and a capital pensioning system was established except for the cost justification system during  the social pension of age amounted at  bgn per moth the average was  and maximal  bgn which represents an increase of  compared to the previous year there are  millions pensioners and  millions pensions because some people receive more than one pension for example for disability and for their age the expenditures on pensions during  amount bgn  billions which is the largest expenditure item of the national statistical institute’s budget  reasons for the high pensioning fees are the nonoperational economy poor competition among enterprises and insufficient collection of the insurance fees as well as the low cost of labour force but one shall in no way rely on the increase of the fees aiming to fill up public insurance taxation funds the fee payable by the employees will increase in during next years versus decreasing of the employers fees but yet the amount of the salary shall be increased in order to compensate the increased insurance fees the rate of the insurance fees is determined on annual basis by a specific law being a percentage of the gross labour remuneration maximal rate of the insurance income due to insurance payments is  minimal labour salaries for the country introduction of additional mandatory pensioning insurance ampi since  does not lead to increase of the total rate of insurance instalments because it is provided for redirecting a part of the public insurance tax to the funds established by private pensioning insurance associations bulgarian employers have some doubts that still higher rates of the mandatory insurance instalments will not allow for the active participation of most of the employers in the process of the additional voluntary pensioning insurance which on the other hand will slow its development the described past and current financial status of the social insurance system gives certain grounds to assume that even in future the achievement of financial equilibrium will be an extremely difficult task one of the reasons is the rate of the insurance fee which has almost reached its maximal level already even if we assume that we base on the lowest insurance instalment collected through the rest of the instalments under professional qualification and unemployment fund pquf and health insurance it would exceed the insurance fees of countries like germany   france   and others if in future balances are still tipped towards the employers the result will remain definitely negative increased social expenditures part of the common volume of the production costs in high cost industries will continue to limit the competitiveness of the enterprises on the internal and external market and respectively their profits such industries will aim at reducing of working places and keeping low labour salary level this is an absolute stimulus for the black labour market as we can guess social insurance gains no profits from the enlarging of this market  there is a sustainable insufficiency of funds current pensioners are the most affected social group because the social insurance system cannot afford an increase of the pensions and keeps their levels suck to the administratively determined ceiling alternatives are two either increase the instalment rates in order to compensate insufficiency or increase subsidies which on its part will lead to misbalance of the state budget ie to budgetary deficit yet the increase of the instalments’ percentage  will come into collision with the employers’ indignation only this is the first barrier which the social insurance is facing when targeting a relative stability of the system if we assume the controversial option – eventual transfer of part of the insurance fees burden to the insured people this will definitely facilitate employers but in macroeconomical plan it will not reduce the financial load to the active population the question is that having in place expenditures distribution system of financing such as it is in bulgaria pillar i the increasing number of pensioners leads to growth of the expenditures and a corresponding necessity to increase percentage of insurance fees  in bulgaria the pensioning burden on the active population is due to the comparatively low pensioning age threshold currently this threshold age is corrected due to the before mentioned reasons even though if the tendency for irregular increase of the pensioner’s number compared to the active population’s number it would create serious difficulties for financial equilibrium and social insurance as well in such situation it is good to raise one more question – whether the active population will bear this burden whether the system of solidarity between generations will stand it ie the question is not only economic but also a moral one currently economically active population bears the consequences of the crisis and except its own standard it has to guarantee the good life standard of the inactive part of the society it is claimed that paying insurance fees today means ensuring future guarantees in our conditions though this assertion is not valid paying their insurances the active population replenishes the funds from which the pensions of the retired population are paid analyzing this vicious circle it is essential to understand that the limits of the solidarity between generations are strongly dependant on the economic interests of each member of the society and the society as a whole in conditions of crisis and dependency on external factors the active population can support the preceding generations which from logical point of view is quite logical but the working people do not agree to put aside money for insurance because they doubt they would be able to use these “savings” and moreover they doubt they can count on future generations’ solidarity based on the above mentioned findings several fundamental conclusions are due − mandatory pension insurance cannot guarantee higher level of the future insurance instalments because the current insurance fee has reached its maximal rate − maintaining insurance instalments within the limits of the bearable is of critical importance for the improvement of the economic conditions including the increase of the employment and decease of unemployment after conclusions comes the turn of the concrete measures which could be undertaken in order to mitigate the negative tendencies the increase of the threshold age for pensioning and the necessary employment record are a fact already but taking into account the worsened health status of bulgarian population it is not considered to be an optimal decision this measure was applied due to the extremely unfavourable demographic picture increasing the threshold of pensioning age up to the one in the other european countries contributes to the balancing of the system though it has undesirable social response it is appropriate to refer to decisions of longer sustainability effect which correspond to the  conditions of the market economy this is the implementation of alternative forms of insurance protection like the second and the third pillars into our insurance system namely the additional mandatory and additional voluntary pensioning insurance according to the third pillar voluntary fees based on certain income could increase the size of their pensions and simultaneously make a significant input to form the insurance fund legal basis on regulating the voluntary and the private insurance was found in the legislation of countries which have long history of functioning market economy the additional voluntary and the mandatory pensioning insurance are considered to be an alternative of the increasing expenditures on the voluntary common regime of pensioning insurance during the last few years mandatory schemes in most of the european countries were oriented to lower insurance instalments and the related lower rates of the compensations increase of the latter is achieved through participation in the second and third pillars the first practical steps towards pensioning reform in bulgaria were made in  when the first  voluntary pensioning funds were established some of them still operational by the end of  more than  companies were implementing real activities in voluntary pension insurance the development of the activities in additional voluntary pension insurance can be assessed through the real achievements during the last  years at this stage these achievements concern only the additional pension insurance because the activities under pillar ii has not started yet the real challenge standing before the pensioning system is its full functioning operation of all its elements despite the complicated socialeconomic situation in the country licensed pension insurance companies entered their role of leading institutions called upon to practically turn in reality the main part of the pensioning reform in the country and activate their funds under the second and third pillar of the system activity under pillar iii is realized by the companies acting also under pillar ii the approve scheme under pillar iii defines two types of voluntary pensioning funds − voluntary pensioning fund pensioning insurance in these funds can be made only through monthly monetary instalments whose rate is determined by the insurance contracts but no less than  of the minimal labour salary for the country − voluntary pensioning fund with investment bonds through these funds a special and very specific for bulgaria voluntary pensioning insurance is carried out funds are created for a period of activity limited up to  years all citizens owing received by the state bonds for mass privatization can participate participants in insurance with bonds have almost the same rights provided for the citizens who make monetary insurance but yet not earlier than five years from the date of their individual lot’s certification  the new legislation related to pensioning reform applies a very strict conservative regime of the investment activities of pensioning insurance companies and insurance finds the assets of the additional pensioning funds can be invested in − securities issued and guaranteed by the state − securities issued for the trade at the regulated jobbing markets − municipal securities − takings on bank deposits  − real estate and mortgages no less than  of the pensioning funds assets have to be invested in securities issued andor guaranteed by the state andor takings on bank deposits only  of the funds’ assets can be invested in securities issued by one commercial company no more than  of the funds’ assets can be invested abroad in gilts municipal bonds and securities which are allowed for trade by bulgarian national bank’s decision pensioning insurance company cannot land or be a guarantor to third persons using the managed assets of the additional pensioning insurance fund it shall be mentioned that due to the poorly developed and almost missing capital market in bulgaria and because of the limited opportunities to use other financial instruments the main part of the investment portfolio of currently active pensioning funds consists of stocks where about   of their assets are invested  maintaining longterm investments for longer time period is a specific principle for bulgarian conditions following the limited requirements for liquidity and necessity to maintain insignificant financial resources for current payments of pensioning funds longterm investment instruments remain in the portfolio until the redemption date this is the way to minimize the risk and only market risk remains to the diversified securities portfolio we could mark several advantages of the opportunity to be insured in additional pensioning fund − insure person’s money are separate from the shareholders’ moneys through distribution of money flows − state agency on insurance control was established and became operational already controlling the entire activity of the pensioning insurance companies − transparency and mandatory accounting are guaranteed trough the right of the insured to be informed participation in professional or universal pensioning fund can be changed by the willingness of the insured  year after the beginning of the insurance period the insured person has the right to transfer the accumulated amounts of hisher individual account from one universal or professional pensioning fund to another universal or professional pensioning fund established and managed by another pensioning insurance company but only once per calendar year − the interest of the insured persons are protected and represented by representatives of the national professional organizations members of the trust councils such trust councils shall be established to each universal or professional pensioning fund and they will monitor the activities of the funds and make recommendations to protect the interests of the insured individuals − each person due to ensuring of additional mandatory pension make hisher choice about the universal or professional pensioning fund through an individual statement submitted to the pensioning insurance company the social partners national representative syndical organizations are authorized to perform consultative functions for the choice of an appropriate pensioning fund the problems of the new insurance system represent the dualistic role of the advantages during the last years additional pensioning funds have significant problems with the investments currently about   of the resource are invested  in vs which means security but with low gains mpic states that up to  in special cases by decision of the state agency of insurance control up to  of the assets can be invested in corporate bonds of one company the argument is that this is the way to prevent money flow out this is not a proper motivation to each such a thesis could be opposed the other one – that one shall create such conditions which will make the business to prefer bulgaria instead of other countries ageing and employment policies the number of people aged over  years is growing up    as it was mentioned their incomes are very low to assure their health and social wellbeing so they have to work additionally or to expect some assistance from the society this is one of the most important challenges in bulgaria ageing also has a womens face as in most countries women live much longer than men gender differences in terms of numbers are most evident in older age groups which means that women will be more concerned by ageing women are more likely to be found in parallel labour markets such as family businesses especially in developing countries however according to official statistics about  per cent of the economically active older population is women so as in the majority of countries life expectancy at birth is higher among women than among men and in most countries women aged  and over are expected to live longer than men a considerable gender imbalance is developing among elderly workers the upper age limit for population of working age gradually increases having reached already  years of age in  and for women this age will increase to  years in  the consequences of this process concern the whole society working people aged  years  of the population has to support  people  and  years old according to prognosis of the un this burden will increase in future years        an ageing population means an ageing workforce which could lead to a conflict of interest between young people and older workers pessimists believe that by  the young and the old will be in conflict and public finances will be in disorder as a result of ageing  the consequences of ageing are multiple and include both economic and social aspects the social results affect family structures living arrangements behaviour and attitudes relations between generations health and other areas of life the economic consequences of ageing are associated with the higher cost to society of supporting the elderly population the implications of ageing which are considered in the present document relate to employment and labour markets the composition of the workforce changes in activity rates genderrelated effects and some others as a result of the ageing the financial burden increases borne by the economically active population the dependency ratio is the number of people under  and over  for every  people in the  age brackets the dependency ratio is rising in european countries for persons aged  and over and will have increased to  by  from  in  in europe in  there were slightly more than  elderly persons per  young people by  this figure had risen to more than  while by  it had increased to over  as the cost to society of an older person can be several times that of a child or an adolescent this shift in the age incidence of dependency ratios implies a potentially very substantial rise in public expenditure   ageing on this scale would place substantial pressures on public finances and reduce growth in living standards these negative consequences of ageing could be offset by policies to encourage immigration higher fertility or fast productivity growth the increase in the number and share of older people poses a number of questions to the society relative to the state of health living standards material support labour and public activity social adaptation and integration of older people into society these topics enter into the social policy sphere concerning the measures taken with view to improving the state of third age people as it’s seen from the table  in  the number of insured persons is with more than  millions persons smaller than the population if working age the governors have to resolve the complex problem how to increase the number of people who pay their insurance for pension otherwise when these cohorts will achieve the retirement age they will not have any resource in the pension fund table  population insured persons and pensioners in bulgaria in millions year population to  population of working age to pensioners total insured persons                                                                 source nsi nssi on the other side the retirement is a serious problem for aged people they loose many social contacts their incomes decrease strongly and the maintenance of health status requires more resources the aim of pension schemes is to provide income support to workers too old to continue working whatever the system adopted and whatever the method of financing retirement pensions can be viewed as a deduction levied on the working population when the number of pensioners increases more rapidly than the number of people in employment it is logical to expect some difficulty in financing the scheme whatever the political or economic system in force and whatever the pensions machinery in operation older workers seek employment and are hired or fired mostly in the same labour markets as all other worker categories it is rare to find special labour markets for them like those that exist for workers with disabilities the laws of a market economy apply to them and they are subject to the same competition for jobs as all others however older workers are often eliminated from labour markets while their younger colleagues can expect to remain the following factors explain the difference in the position of older workers the general labour market conjuncture the level of a countrys development the economic cycle the availability of a social safety net the  efficiency of labour market institutions educational and health factors the size of the informal sector labour law and others the supply side of labour markets for older workers is affected by economic legislative social health and demographic factors apart from these factors older workers require skills needed in labour markets in order to be employable the demand side is also affected by economic legislative and social factors but in addition it is affected by the state of the market and the business cycle early retirement for example has been used in some countries as a countercyclical measure in bulgaria since  was undertook a reform in determination of retirement age it’s calculated as sum of the age of each person and the years of employment and results in a number of points for males –  for females –    unemployment could be considered as discriminatory in respect of older workers unless measures are taken to equalize their chances in labour markets older workers who are forced to retire feel excluded from society what factors affect the labour force participation decisions of older workers these can be divided into three broad categories the first involves their eligibility for a pension and the amount of the pension being eligible for a pension means a reduced probability of labour force participation the second factor is the mandatory retirement system the third factor involves working conditions wages in particular have an enormous impact on the decision to work the higher the wages older workers are paid the more likely they are to participate in the labour force discrimination against older workers is a longstanding problem in fact older workers were the targets of discrimination already in the golden age of full employment in europe in the postwar years age discrimination can be found in both the state and the private sectors in official policies and in employment policies pursued at enterprise level some age discrimination measures are evident direct while others are concealed indirect direct discrimination consists of openly treating older workers less favourably than others direct measures include compulsory retirement at a fixed age a maximum age for recruitment and age limits on access to training  an obvious manifestation of discrimination occurs in vacancy announcements which impose an age limit of  or  years however age discrimination makes itself felt some  years before the official retirement age sometimes earlier if wage increments depend on length of service relatively older people who are still in their prime might find themselves targeted for dismissal retirement programmes and schemes have to be elaborated and the might comprise the following measures reduced early pensions more generous invalidity benefits partial pension benefits to complement income from parttime employment continuous payment of unemployment benefits and relaxation of registration criteria enterprise and industrylevel schemes voluntary early retirement and redundancy arrangements if a worker who became unemployed at the age of  continues to receive unemployment benefit until the age of  the official retirement age then this worker has been channelled into retirement through an extended period of unemployment this challenge has to be transform into an opportunity such transformation requires the efforts of the society and also individuals for adoption and implementation of rational employment and healthcare policy with population ageing the share of the population in the working ages will shrink and the labour force itself will grow older this process could become a drag  on economic growth unless the decline in labour force growth can be controlled or greater efforts are made to increase labour productivity health care system the main target of the health policy and health reform in bulgaria is the improvement of population’s health and the health protection system it includes the following priorities − decrease of infant mortality and improvement of maternal healthcare − limitation of morbidity mortality and disability resulting from socially significant diseases by the means of designing and implementing healthcare programs − maintenance of efficient antiepidemiological control − limitations of health risks ensuring of safe labour conditions and limiting the risks for human health coming from the environment − reduction of risk factors related to the health of aged people and people in unfavourable and nonequivalent status − improvement of the psychic health of population − establishment of preconditions for and leaving a healthy life promotion of health and prevention from diseases − elaboration and permanent progress and improvement of the healthcare system and its efficient functioning organization by the means of the healthcare reform which started in  a major number of good structural and functional decisions related to healthcare systems of insurance type combined with some elements of the national health services were applied this is a new model more and more applicable in the practice of the different countries know as a “publicprivate mix” following this model the state insurance public and corporate and private sectors  each of them having its own perimeter of activity rights and responsibility are represented in different scale and levels the most typical feature of the publicprivate model is that all health activities with divisible effect are in the sphere of the private production of services with dominant public financing combined with a smaller by size private cofinancing excluded from this classical market segment are only those healthcare problems for which the user is not able to take self dependent decisions for example emergency stationary psychiatric aid and other similar decisions at the same time any healthcare activities with an inseparable effect such as state health control programs on the governance of socially significant diseases mandatory health treatment antiepidemiological measures etc still remain in the sphere of the public financing and the dominantly public and smaller scale private production of those services  reforms in the sphere of curative health protection are radical and exceptionally serious the rights of the patients were regulated and protected in relation with the medical aid rendered in the medical institutions as well as the rights of the medical specialists providing medical assistance and healthcare reforms in the sphere of curative health protection started with the adoption from the national  assembly five new structural laws on health protection system in the period before  and in  another one concerning dominantly public health protection they are as follows − law on healthy and safe labour conditions  − law on health insurance –  − law on physicians’ and stomatologists’ professional organizations –  − law on medical institutions злз –  − law on drugs and pharmacies of human medicine –  − law on health –  through these laws the structure scope organization management and financing of the medical stomatological and drug activities were determined another important characteristic of the changes in the medical care system is regulating the contractual outset of the relations between medical institutions and the financing bodies namely the national health insurance fund nhif all bulgarian citizens are mandatory insured through specific set of medical aid which is paid by the nhif medical car is provided in the medical institutions based on a contract between them and the nhif substructures – the regional health insurance funds rhif rhif pay to the medical institutions the provided medical services based on specific prices increasing the share of the voluntary health insurance associations will break up the monopoly of the nhif third important characteristic is ensuring the right of the customer to choose a physician and stomatologist for primary aid medical institution for specialized extrahospital aid and since  – for hospital aid thus the administrative compulsion for choice and limitation of citizens’ rights to chose specialists or medical institutions were eliminated the legally regulated management juridical and economic independence of the entities in the area of healthcare – medical institutions and financial bodies together with the enforcement of contractual relations and the right of free choice of the customer are the main preconditions for the establishment of medical services market and competition among the healthcare institutions financing national health insurance fund finances the healthy care for insured citizen health insurance is mandatory in bulgaria in cases when citizen is insured also in voluntary health insurance association then expenses on his treatment depending on his contract are paid by the concerned association as well when the citizen is hospitalized following his personal desire and without any direction from his general physician or specialist then heshe pays on his own the costs of hisher treatment the citizens which are mandatory insured except for the insurance instalment are paying also a fee for each primary visit to the physician or stomatologist a customers fee at the amount of  from the minimal working salary and for each day of treatment in medical institution but no more than  days per year the amount of  from the minimal working salary certain categories of citizens are exempted from customer’s fees public costs for healthcare have reached  bgn per capita in  which is twice more than in  as a percentage of gdp the public expenses on healthcare during the last five years are sustainable positioned in the range  average  following the who’s expert evaluations for the same period private financing for healthcare has approximated the size of the public one great part of the private financing is unregulated by legislation and is deemed to the detriment of the good practices  access to heath care outpatient healthcare territorial distribution and coverage with health institutions of the country as well as its planning is regulated by the national and regional health protection maps which are updated each five years they contain the number of the different medical institutions in the different territorial units regions and municipalities these medical institutions conclude contracts with the regional health insurance funds for providing of healthcare to the concerned population equality between public state and municipal and private institutions is legally regulated main characteristic of the reform in the healthcare system is the radically changed legal status and the full juridical financial and economic independence of the medical institutions − individual practices for primary and specialized physicians’ and stomatological aid can be registered from and are property of the respective physicians and stomatologists − group practices for primary and specialized physicians’ and stomatological aid medical stomatological and mixed centres diagnostic and consultative centres and medicaltechnician’s laboratories and hospices are established in the form of commercial entities or cooperations when necessary such institutions can be established as associations with limited responsibility or joint stock companies from the state or municipalities independently or jointly with other entities − medical care institutions medical and social care institutions and dispensaries are established from the state and the municipalities from legal and physical persons in the form of commercial companies or cooperations − property and responsibility of the state remain emergency centres centres for transfusion hematology institutions for stationary psychiatric aid institutions for medical monitoring and specific care for children and also some medical institutions at different ministries ministry of defense ministry of the internal affairs ministry of transport ministry of justice − hospital inpatient healthcare medical institutions for hospital care are multiprofiled and specialized hospitals and they can be for active treatment for restoration to health and extended treatment for rehabilitation etc depending to the territory and the related accreditation hospitals can be district regional interregional university and national hospitals all hospitals for active treatment rehabilitation and longterm treatment as well as hospices were transformed in  into companies with limited responsibility or joint venture companies they are not yet privatized but a procedure for privatization of part of them is on the way the payment of the inpatient care is based on contract with the nhif following the group of disease defined as “clinical paths” each hospital is authorized to sign a contract for financing with all twelve associations for voluntary health insurance  hospital doctors are paid under labour agreements which are formed within  of the hospital income though registered as corporations hospitals receive its financing from nhif following the administratively established prices once a year negotiations are held between the nhif and the professional organizations of the doctors to negotiate the specific rate of these prices latter are listed in the national framework contract due to exceeded expenses of the nhif those prices can be revised once at every  months each insured person pays for each day of treatment in medical institution but no more than  days per year the amount of  from the minimal working salary the improper financing of the treatment in medical institutions led to the emerging of a serious black market limited number of state hospitals is financed by the state municipalities have no financing functions  the status of the healthcare is one of the most synthetic indices for the levels of the economic development and quality of life unfortunately in bulgaria this is the sector where structural reforms have failed in great extend if we summarize what was achieved during the period of transition main results were attained in placing the financial relationships among the state customers and providers of medical services on the basis of the health insurance entrusting the outpatient aid to the general practitioners and specialists increasing of their incomes improvement of some of the indices for hospital equipment’s utilization however negatives are much more the negative balance of the healthcare reform can be seen through the worsened indexes of the nation’s common health status mortality has increased reasons are mainly diseases of blood circulation system two thirds of the lethal cases were caused by infarcts and apoplexies second ranked are cancer diseases whose growth is rising rapidly disorders of respiratory system are main reasons for hospitalization as half of the cases are with lethal outcome and are caused by pneumonia another alarming tendency is the growing distribution of psychic disorders they rarely lead to preliminary death and thus remain out of the health statistics focus the number of the disabled people increased three times during the period of transition as the newly registered cases are almost twice more than the average for the european union and one of the highest in world disorders of blood circulation system are the most frequent causes for such harms and lethal cases an important index for the efficiency of the healthcare is mortality among children below one year in the beginning of the transitional period bulgaria was positioned close to the central and eastern european countries and better than poland and hungaria seventeen years later bulgaria is at the bottom of the list only albania and romania from the balkan peninsula countries have higher mortality rates of the newborn the probability that a child die in bulgaria before it becomes  years old is three times higher than in the ec and twice than in the new ec member states the causes for the infant high mortality are most often preliminary birth complications during the prenatal period diseases of respiratory system and different infections the years of transition are marked with the worsening of some health indices which reflect problems that are specific for the low income countries distribution of tuberculosis and hepatitis besides these evidences for ineffective healthcare system are average statistical ones ie they hide the higher values of these rates including mortality of the newborn in the villages and the regions of compact ethnical population worsened health indices are partially due to the negative demographic tendencies – decreased birth rate and emigration of young people abroad sharpen the  problem of the ageing of population the main reason for these bad tendencies more and more becomes the limited access to health services serious obstacle for the access to health aid is the income drop down and the increased economic vulnerability of the population combined with the transition to health insurance system low incomes and increased health risks are bound into a wicked circle where due to the lack of labour people remain out of the health aid scope as a result bad peoples’ health limits their access to the labour market increases their poverty and social isolation unemployed people and people with low incomes are not the only ones who are facing higher health risks due to the transition to market economy to different extent it concerns the entire society the reason is that liberalization of prices and entrepreneurship were not accompanied with adequate legal and institutional measures for protection of the employees and customers’ rights this led to increasing of health risks at the working place and at home state is not yet completely effective in applying the standards for safety at working place and safety of foods as well as environmental protection standards and it also has no clear policy for protection of the customers from monopolistic or oligopolistic drug prices high social and economic stress combined with a weaker protection of employees and customers resulted in worsening the health status and life quality of the population bulgarians however pay health insurance fees and as much

counting the informal are not low at all when compared with international rates the problem is that in our country they are improperly distributed referring to the direct personal payments that is why the priority of the health reform shall be not the increase of the mandatory health insurance fee but the directing of this significant resource of official and unofficial direct payments which following the most conservative evaluations are in the range of  from the gdp for health services and to the currently narrowed market of additional private insurance packages precisely this is the substance of the healthcare restructuring in direction to more competitive and customers’ oriented choice leaving the state without an opportunity to transfer its responsibilities to the market developed health systems account at highest extent on the economical stimulators regulation and control are vitally important as far as they aim at protecting the rights of the customers and the suppliers the quality of the health services though can be achieved through competition and incentives  in our country the reform is based on total administrative control instead of adequate financial stimuli moreover control is mainly at the entrance of the system its basic tools are accreditation of medical institutions and medical standards accreditation of medical institutions aims at insuring of minimal standards of  technical equipment and qualification which are necessary for the relevant services covered by the nhif the funds reimbursed by the nhif are not bound to the quality of the services thus after obtaining the accreditation and covering the standards medical practices and hospitals have no incentives to invest in capacity building new technologies and direct capitals for the improvement of the healthcare quality the system is designed in such a way that it could cover a general minimal level of the standards taxation of hospitals is also a push back instrument hospital services are vatfree and this puts hospitals in the position of end consumer of drugs medications equipment ie they do not have the right to take a tax credit for these expenses thus they are encouraged to increase their costs for labour instead of investments medications external services including training of the staff state regulations also act in this direction hospitals cannot reallocate for salaries less than  of the funds coming from the nhif there is no upper limit of the salaries also there is no bottom limit for drugs and medications having these regulations in place and the insufficient coverage of the expensive clinical paths it is not curious that hospitals try to transfer expenditures for drugs and medications to the insured patients though they are not included in the value of their clinical paths it is evident that currently healthcare policy cannot find an adequate answer for the problems related to the blocked health reform in the hospital sector nor for the mistaken system for financial stimuli and inadequate quality control management through the instruments of the administrative control at the entry of the system the society’s attention though is attracted by the salaries of the doctors and their appeals to the state to equip at least some of the priority hospitals who will equip the others – this is not clear the state transfers its

regions conclusions     up to now older workers have been the losers in labour markets as a result of official employment policies and labour market measures all workers may experience spells of unemployment interrupting their careers but older workers suffer disproportionately from nonemployment in addition once interrupted their careers are much more difficult to resume present policies in respect of older workers still generally consider them as a labour reserve rather than as active labour market participants some forms of employment have turned out to be the niches preferred by workers in the upper age groups older workers should be provided with opportunities to update existing skills and acquire new skills older workers can also benefit from measures promoting selfemployment increasing the retirement age leads to growth in the economically active population and decreases the number of pensioners hence the impact on gdp would be favourable and a better chance to balance pension schemes will be provided however increasing the retirement age requires simultaneous employment promotion to ensure that jobs are available to all jobseekers workplace and working time adjustments can be effective tools for promoting the employment of older workers at the same time they are relatively lower cost solutions     additional research is required on older workers and new issues for such research have to be identified courses for training of elder and old people aim at acquainting the audience with the main problems of aging and old age main tasks are

product impact in the last decade the medicinal products from biological origin are growing extremely and the forecast till year  will be nearly  of all new marketing authorized product will be of

“biosimilar” for marketing authorisation in eu the general requirements for generic products are not sufficient for biosimilar products because any changes in the manufacturing process may generate significant differences in terms of quality safety and efficacy the efficacy and safety of a biosimilar biotech molecule is not necessarily to be the same for all indications therefore according to the pharmaceutical review  the applicants for biosimilar products will have to provide to emea specific preclinical and clinical data for each therapeutic indication and also for new routes of

based on  biopharma revenues note in all top company profiles dollar amounts are in millions  an abridged registration procedure which allows an applicant for marketing authorisation of a generic medicinal product to provide bioequivalence studies instead of necessary clinical trials the manufacturer must prove the quality of the generic medicinal product and since the active substance is already well known for its safety and efficacy the generic must only demonstrate its therapeutic equivalence to the reference product through what are known as bioequivalence studies no legal framework has existed for generic medicines derived from biotechnology before  this deficiency was solved during the review of eu pharmaceutical legislation known as the “pharma review ” specific provisions were adopted in the final text under the codecision procedure by the european council and the european parliament establishing a legal base for biogenerics where “similar biological medicinal products“ are possible to be authorised under condition pointed in the directive ec the commission published a new directive ec  went into force on  november  introduced a legal framework for biosimilar medicines identical to  that for generic medicines article i iii of the directive ec together with part ii section  of annex  provided the guidelines for a biosimilar dossier biological medicinal products are defined in part i  b of directive ec with replace the annex  of directive ec the definition in article   in ec was not applicable for the biological medicinal products and the concept for “essential similarity” was not possible to be used the medicines legislation from  amending the community code on medicinal products for human use directive ec article  paragraph  introduces the requirements for biosimilars  the directive ec which change the community code pointed in art  out what should be covered by the biological medicinal product similar to the referent product they couldn’t be taken as biogenerics because of differences in the manufacturing processes used substance molecular properties and the therapeutically efficacy the final text of this new legislation was approved on  march  by the council and was transposed into national law and in effect throughout the eu by november   “where a biological medicinal product which is similar to a reference biological product does not meet the conditions in the definition of generic medicinal products owing to in particular differences relating to raw materials or differences in manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the reference biological medicinal product the results of appropriate preclinical tests or clinical trials relating to these conditions must be provided the type and quantity of supplementary data to be provided must comply with the relevant criteria stated in annex i and the related detailed guidelines the results of other tests and trials from the reference medicinal product’s dossier shall not be provided”  the directives ec and eg changed of specific marketing authorization application requirements additional modules    of the ctd format particular the toxicological and clinic profile of module  and  shall be provided the practical approach depends on the analytical possibility in order to comply with the “biosimilarity” on the respective manufacturing process on the clinical and regulatory experience the approach could be used for well characterized biotech medicinal products all recombinant dnahybridomtechnic and all products with derivate and conjugate as biopharmaceuticals are defined by their production process any change can impact safety and efficacy and therefore demands new approval  both the precise definition and the requirements for this therapeutic category in article   of directive ec as amended have created a number of implications the process for marketing authorization and preparation of biosimilar medicinal products is clearer and more precise than in the past where even in case of a positive opinion of chmp like inn somatropin – trade name omnitrop london  june  cpmp  no marketing authorization on somatropin omnitrop was granted by the commission as omnitrop was not considered to have wellestablished use and thus was not authorized till the directive ec had come into force omnitrop was authorized later like a first biosimilar product authorized by the community after review  was introduced and the directive was already in place during  and  the number of submitted biosimilar applications to emea is  and  respectively  figure  biosimilar application to emea  the fda legislation for “follow  on biologics” the us fda concedes that it has no framework for “followon biologics” for the vast majority of therapeutic proteins subject to biologic licensing under the public health service act the us fda concedes that it has no statutory framework for “followon

growth hormones insulin etc an abbreviated process for limited types of biologics types of tests to demonstrate structural similarity and comparability immunogenicity testing requirements was outlined interchange ability for biologics represents a fundamentally more complex issue an approach and many guidelines were published the fda has pointed out concern for large comparative crossover studies for interchange ability rating and the acceptance of biosimilars by the medical community  approaches dealt with comparability in the emea and ich guidelines  the comparability of biotechnicalbiological products subjects to change in the manufacturing process in the clinical studies and after the marketing authorisation is subject of ich guideline  ich qe  the terms “comparability” has two aspects in the ich guidelines qe refers to changes in the established manufacturing processes within the same manufacturer of an existing biotech medicinal products in that case the requirements for demonstrating the comparability are not the same than for demonstrating similarity of biological product  with commission regulation ec and ec stipulating the need for more costly lengthy and complex type ii variation where simpler ia or ib  procedure would be applicable for small molecule when manufacturer introduce major changes and then the regulator may view the resulting protein as an entirely new medicinal product with need to demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy  the comparability of biotechnicalbiological products subjects to change in the manufacturing process in the clinical studies clinical development determinations of product comparability can be based on quality considerations whether the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability the extent and nature of preclinical and clinical studies will be determined on a casebycase basis where various factors shall be considered  demonstration of comparability during development during product development it is expected that multiple changes in the manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality safety and efficacy comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that preclinical and clinical data generated with prechange product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and support the marketing authorisation comparability studies conducted for products in development could be influenced by several of factors such as the stage of product development the availability of validated analytical procedures and the extent of product knowledge which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has with the process comparability of biotechnologicalbiological products is required the comparability exercise should utilise available information and will generally become more comprehensive process changes introduced in late stages of development and when no additional clinical studies are planned to support the marketing authorisation the comparability exercise should be as comprehensive uses method in that case some outcomes of the comparability studies on quality attributes can lead to additional nonclinical or clinical studies due to the limitations of the analytical steps in early clinical development physicochemical and biological tests alone might be considered inadequate to determine comparability and therefore bridging preclinical andor clinical studies as appropriate might be needed in order for a comparability exercise to occur during development appropriate assessment tools should be used and analytical procedures used during development might not be validated but should provide results that are reliable and reproducible   preclinical and clinical considerations comparability determination can be based on quality considerations if the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies and additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability all nonclinical and clinical studies are determined on a casebycase basis in consideration of different factors which include quality findings the nature and the level of knowledge of the product and existing nonclinical and clinical data relevant to the product   the comparability of biotechnicalbiological products subjects to change in the manufacturing process after the marketing authorisation  a determination of comparability can be based on a combination of analytical testing biological assays and in some cases nonclinical and clinical data if a  manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies alone nonclinical or clinical studies with the postchange product are not warranted where the relationship between specific quality safety and efficacy issues has not been established and differences between quality of the pre and postchange product are observed it might be appropriate to include a combination of quality nonclinical andor clinical studies in the comparability exercise the goal of the comparability exercise is to ensure the quality safety and efficacy of drug product produced by a changed manufacturing process through collection and evaluation of the relevant data to determine whether there might be any adverse impact on the drug product due to the manufacturing process changes the demonstration of comparability does not mean that the quality issues of the prechange and postchange product are identical but that they are highly similar and that the existing knowledge could ensure that any differences in quality attributes have no adverse impact upon safety or efficacy of the product to identify the impact of a manufacturing process change a careful evaluation of all foreseeable consequences for the product should be performed the quality data on the pre and postchange product are generated and a comparison is performed that integrates and evaluates all data collected eg − routine batch analyses − inprocess control − process validationevaluation data − characterisation and stability if appropriate the comparison of the results to the predefined criteria should allow an objective assessment of whether or not the pre and postchange products are comparable the manufacturer could be faced with one of several outcomes as follows − no adverse impact on safety or efficacy profiles is foreseen pre and postchange product are highly similar and considered comparable − the analytical procedures used are not sufficient to discern relevant differences that can impact the safety and efficacy of the product additional testing eg further characterisation or nonclinical andor clinical studies to reach a definitive conclusion should be performed − differences in the quality attributes of the prechange and postchange product observed it can be justified that no adverse impact on safety or efficacy profiles is expected based on the manufacturer’s accumulated experience relevant information and data in these circumstances pre and postchange product can be considered comparable − comparison of quality attributes and a possible adverse impact on safety and efficacy profiles cannot be excluded and the manufacturer should consider performing preclinical andor clinical studies − differences in the quality attributes are so significant that it is determined that the products are not highly similar and are therefore not comparable preclinical or clinical data allows extrapolation of the existing data from the drug product produced by the current process to the drug product from the changed process the products should have highly similar quality attributes biopharmaceutical product before and after manufacturing process changes and that there is no adverse  impact on the safety or efficacy and immunogenicity of the drug product occurred based on an analysis of product quality attributes comparability to reference medicinal products of similar biological medicinal products is subject of the emea guidelines biosimilar medicinal products are manufactured and controlled according to their own development an extensive comparability exercise is required to demonstrate that the similar biological and reference products have similar attributes in terms of quality safety and efficacy the quality issues relevant for comparability presenting of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant dnaderived proteins are addressed in the “guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnologyderived proteins as active substances quality issues” emeachmp  when an application for biological medicinal product is containing a biotechnologyderived medicinal protein as active substance it refers to a reference medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of the data protection period in accordance with title iii chapter i article  as the amended directive ec  the marketing authorisation ma application dossier of a biological medicinal product claimed to be similar to a reference product already authorised shall provide a full module  quality dossier and equivalent efficacy and safety of the similar biological medicinal product has to be demonstrated as well biological medicines are usually complex and often heterogeneous no modern analytical methodology may be adequate for full characterisation following process change this is addressed in the released ich and chmp guidelines the directive ec and the guideline chmp bwp stress that the impact of any process change need to be considered on a caseby case basis  this may involve merely testing against the finished product specification but in many cases additional extensive characterisation is required which may need to include nonclinical and clinical studies according to the european guidelines a manufacturer can claim that a new product is similar to a therapeutic protein already on the market the claim should be substantiated concerning quality safety and efficacy which are the three main parts of a new drug application for all three parts of the dossier  quality safety and efficacy of the same innovator product should be used as a reference reference medicinal product is a medicinal product authorised in the eea on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with the provisions of article  of directive ec as amended the active substance of a similar biological medicinal product must be similar in molecular and biological characteristic to the active substance of the reference medicinal product the same reference product should be used throughout the comparability program for quality safety and efficacy studies during the development of a similar biological medicinal product in order to allow the generation of coherent data and conclusions the pharmaceutical form strength and route of administration of the similar biological medicinal product should be the same as that of the reference medicinal  product and in case when the pharmaceutical form or the strength or the route of administration differ the results of appropriate nonclinicalclinical trials must be provided in order to demonstrate the safetyefficacy of the similar biological medicinal product any differences between the similar biological medicinal product and the reference medicinal product will have to be justified by appropriate studies on a casebycase basis reference active substance  the comparison of the biosimilar active substance to a publicly available standard as a reference ie pheur who etc is not sufficient to demonstrate biosimilarity of the active substance since this material may not have known and defined safety and efficacy profiles and the manufacturer generally does not have access to the originator active substance and cannot directly compare his active substance to the one used in the originator’s medicinal product based on more than one analytical method the biosimilar manufacturer must demonstrate that the active substance used in the comparability exercise is representative of the active substance present in the reference medicinal product applicant should use various approaches to obtain representative reference active substance derived from the reference medicinal product in order to perform the comparative analysis at the active substance level where this approach should be appropriately validated the suitability of the sample preparation process and should include the comparison of the biosimilar active substance with active substance material derived from the reference and the biosimilar medicinal products  comparability exercise for demonstrating biosimilarity analytical methods for biosimilar medicinal products characterisation studies “stateoftheart” should be applied to the biosimilar and reference medicinal products in parallel at both the active substance and the medicinal product levels to demonstrate with a high level of assurance that the quality of the biosimilar product is comparable to the reference medicinal product analytical considerations  suitability of available analytical methods given the e complexity of the molecule and its inherent heterogeneity the set of analytical techniques should represent the stateoftheart and should be selected by the manufacturer in order to detect slight differences in the characteristics of the biotechnologyderived product and the selected methods used in the comparability exercise would be able to detect differences in all quality aspects biological activity  the comparability exercise should include an assessment of the biological properties of the similar biological medicinal product and the reference medicinal product biological assays using different approaches to measure the biological activity should be considered as appropriate the results of relevant biological assays should be provided and expressed in units of activity calibrated against an international or national reference standard when available and appropriate and these assays should comply with appropriate european pharmacopoeia requirements for biological assays if applicable  purity and impurities  the purity and impurity profiles of the active substance and medicinal product should be assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively by a combination of analytical procedures for both reference and biosimilar products tithe manufacturer developing biosimilar products would normally not have access to all necessary information that could allow a comparison  with the reference medicinal product information provides conclusions on the purity and impurity profiles the impurities in the biosimilar product should be identified and compared to the reference product using stateoftheart technologies and depending on the impurity it my be necessary to conduct trials in order to prove that there is no adverse impact of the surveyed biosimilar product specifications are defined as described in ich qb note for guidance on specifications test procedures and acceptance criteria for biotechnologicalbiological  the acceptance criteria should be described and each acceptance criteria should be established and justified based on data obtained from lots used in nonclinical andor clinical studies and by data from lots used for the demonstration of manufacturing consistency data from stability studies relevant development data and data obtained from the comparability exercise quality safety and efficacy the goal of the comparability exercise is to ensure the quality safety and efficacy of drug product produced by a changed manufacturing process through collection and evaluation of the relevant data to determine whether there might be any adverse impact on the drug product due to the manufacturing process changes conclusion the demonstration of comparability does not necessarily mean that the quality attributes of the prechange and postchange product are identical but that they are highly similar and that the existing knowledge is sufficiently predictive to ensure that any differences in quality attributes have no adverse impact upon safety or efficacy of the drug product although in europe a regulatory path for approval of “biogenerics” was no longer possible before end  the regulatory path of biosimilars is directed to demonstrate considerable quality preclinical and clinical data the regulatory authorities are breaking new grounds in regards with the biosimilar products the balanced approach adopted by emea regarding the additionally published guidelines for biosimilars after directive ec will allow evaluation on a case by case basis and the well defined framework can be built up on the based of the scientific knowledge the extent and the nature of nonclinical tests and clinical studies on biosimilar products are determined in consideration of various factors according to review  many guidelines specifying the “appropriate preclinical tests or clinical trials” clarifying the general requirements for biological products in terms of safety and efficacy are issued nonetheless there are still many questions about the data required to demonstrate biosimilarity with a biological reference product and how companies will manage after having received scientific advice by emea and new additional guidelines − immunogenicity assessment of

implementation of new methods in formulating health policy based on sound research data – the so called evidence based policy this new approach to health policy helps experts formulate decisions on the basis of good information concerning programs and projects through presenting supporting evidence from research which in turn becomes the core for political development and implementation we decided to analyze the project for a national health strategy  of bulgaria and see how well it corresponds to the principles of evidence based policy critical evaluation of the last draft of the national health strategy  reveals a number of weaknesses due to the documents’ inconformity with the basic principles of evidence based policy making we conclude with a discussion on possible implications for bulgaria’s health policy an introductory lecture will gives the students first insight in characteristics of evidence based health policy the theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study after introductory lectures students should first carefully read the recommended readings afterwards they can discuss the case study with other students in continuation they need to find

based policy – practical approaches the bulgarian national health strategy  petko salchev nikolay hristov lidia georgieva theoretical background policy coming from the greek word politike meaning power can be defined as the goaloriented activities of empowered individuals or groups in a given society health policy in reality aims the distribution of a nation’s limited resources in such a manner so as to produce the best possible public health results the state health policy represents the officially accepted longterm strategy for development of the national health system it should be noted that a common weakness of many contemporary healthcare reforms is the insufficient attention paid to setting priorities and their ranking according to social significance possible priorities are essential public health problems eg coronary incidents sectors of the health system requiring high priority development eg emergency care population groups requiring guaranteed health services provision eg retired persons the process of policy formulation is so fundamental that any future steps become impossible until we have a clear idea what our goals are and to what end will certain strategic tasks lead us political consensus and the support of society and media are quite necessary in setting out public health priorities  in recent years we see the successful implementation of new methods in formulating health policy based on sound research data – the so called evidence based policy this is a new approach to health policy which helps experts to take decisions on the basis of good information concerning programs and projects through presenting supporting evidence from research which in turn become the core for political development and implementation  evidencebased policy is public policy informed by rigorously established objective evidence from a historical perspective it can be thought of as an extension of the idea of evidencebased medicine to all areas of public policy evidence based policy is particularly associated with the name of the distinguished british statistician adrian smith – a former president of the royal statistical society smith is famous as a proponent of bayesian statistics and evidence based practice — a general extension of the concept of evidence based medicine into all areas of public policy in accord with bayesian statistics the notion of policy based evidence making also emerged – this is a pejorative term which refers to the commissioning of research in order to support a policy which has already been decided upon as the name suggests policy based evidence making means working retrospectively from a predefined policy to produce underpinning evidence working from a conclusion to provide only supporting evidence in favour of already running policy should be distinguished from the method of research into the effects of a policy where such research may prove either supporting or contradicting the term ‘policy based evidence making’ was referred to in a report of the uk house of commons select committee on science and technology into scientific  advice risk and evidence based policy making issued in october  but in a somehow negative light the committee stated that ministers should not seek selectively to pick pieces of evidence which support an already agreed policy or even commission research in order to produce a justification for policy  a distinguishing aspect of evidencebased policy is the use of scientifically rigorous studies such as randomized controlled trials to identify in advance programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes a very general definition of research would be ‘any systematic effort to increase the stock of knowledge’ according to the oxford concise english dictionary ‘evidence’ means information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid different types of evidence exist like systematic reviews single research studies pilot studies and case studies experts’ opinions information available on the internet while randomized controlled trials are widely considered to provide the most reliable form of scientific evidence in the clinical care context the complexity of the health policy context demands different types of evidence observational studies qualitative research and even ‘experience’ ‘knowhow’ consensus and ‘local knowledge’ should also be taken into account it is often difficult to apply rigid hierarchies of evidence to health policy like this is practiced in evidencebased medicine evidence can be used to help improve understanding of an issue influence policy thinking and assist in the communication and defence of decisions it could be used in the different stages of the policy process at the creation of the policy in its development in its implementation and in its defencejustification probably most important is that robust evidence gives government officials confidence in their decisions and the ability to defend these decisions in the face of possible criticism there is a long tradition of evidencebased and evidenceinformed policy within the uk building on the thinking in the modernizing government white paper the cabinet office published ‘professional policy making for the st century’ in   this identified nine core competencies sometimes referred to as the ‘nine principles’ of good policy making the distinguished features of professional policy included “using evidence’ as well throughout ‘professional policy making for the st century’ there is a strong emphasis that policy making should be based on evidence of what works and that the civil service must improve departments’ capacity to make best use of evidence to enable this to happen the report called on departments to ‘improve the accessibility of the evidence available to policy makers’ more recently the ‘professional skills for government’ initiative has been developed as a key part of the government’s delivery and reform agenda to ensure the whole of the civil service has the right mix of skills and expertise to enable department or agencies to deliver effective services  within this framework of skills and experiences necessary for any civil servant to do their job well are four core skills one of which is ‘analysis and use of evidence’ under this core skill policy makers are expected to − anticipate and secure appropriate evidence − test for deliverability of policypractice – and evaluate − use evidence to challenge decision making − identify ways to improve policypractice − champion a variety of tools to collectuse evidence − ensure use of evidence is consistent with wider government requirements − work in partnership with a wide range of expertsanalysts  a british report clearly identified the factors that facilitate the use of evidence and factors that impede it the main factors associated with ‘useful’ evidence that can lead to better policy making were good timing of the analysis with longterm data collection resource availability in terms of research budgets and policy and analytical staff capacity quality of the evidence availability of the required evidence presentation of the evidence focus of reports and other forms of evidence analytical findings relating directly to the area of interest trustworthiness of available evidence is it from a credible source  evidence based policy is generally a discourse or set of methods which informs the policy process rather than one which aims directly to affect the eventual goals of the policy it advocates a more rational rigorous and systematic approach the pursuit of such policy is based on the premise that policy decisions should be better informed by available evidence and should include rational analysis policy and practice which are based on systematic evidence are seen to produce better outcomes the desired progression is a shift away from opinion based policies being replaced by a more rigorous rational approach that gathers critically appraises and uses high quality research evidence to inform policymaking and professional practice the issues governments should consider when trying identifying what evidence is useful are − accuracy is the evidence correctly describing what it purports to do − objectivity the quality of the approach taken to generate evidence and the objectiveness of the source as well as the extent of contestation regarding evidence − credibility this relates to the reliability of the evidence and therefore whether we can depend on it for monitoring evaluation or impact assessments − generalisability is there extensive information or are there just selective cases or pilots − relevance whether evidence is timely topical and has policy implications − availability the existence of good evidence − rootedness is evidence grounded in reality − practicalities whether policymakers have access to the evidence in a useful form and whether the policy implications of the research are feasible and affordable  according to the world health organization one of the greatest challenges facing the member states is how to ensure access to safe and effective health services for those population groups most in need strengthening health systems is a core part of this challenge however more evidence is needed about what works in terms of health system strengthening and under what conditions who estimates that health policy and systems research hpsr was neglected for many years and while some other areas such as health financing are nowadays much better understood than some  years ago other issues such as how to retain and motivate the health workforce or what service delivery models work best in resourceconstrained developing countries remain poorly understood unlike other types of health research health policy and systems research needs to be rooted in and remain responsive to national needs health systems and social economic and political contexts vary so widely that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for health system strengthening instead every country  needs sufficient capacity to analyze its own health system and drawing on international experience develop and evaluate its own health systemstrengthening strategies developing national capacity for health policy and systems research is critical – but may not be enough national governments also need to ensure that research gets synthesized summarized and packaged in ways that policymakers and civil society representatives can use and that policymakers have sufficient capacity to access and apply these research findings as developing societies become increasingly democratic it is even more important that research evidence is widely accessible and can be used by multiple stakeholders both governmental and nongovernmental to inform of their policy positions capacity in itself is a widely but often superficially used term capacity issues mainly arise with the different aspects of the relationship between two key groups – policymakers and researchers the ability of policymakers to draw on appropriate evidence is often restricted by its availability generating appropriate trustworthy evidence depends in turn on the existence of good research organizations at present the capacity of such organizations in low and middle income countries is generally inadequate founders’ attention has historically focused on developing the skills of individual researchers true capacitystrengthening strategies for the future in contrast need to focus on the comprehensive needs of academic and administrative institutions including overall skills and career development development of leadership governance and administrative systems and strengthening networks among the research community both nationally and internationally over recent years there has been noted at least a proliferation of literature focusing on knowledge and how to get it into health policy and practice ever since the s the ‘evidence based medicine’ movement has advocated the greater and more direct use of research evidence in the making of clinical decisions and this was later broadened into a call for more evidencebased policy as opposed to policies determined through opinions or political biases much of this interest arose from the perception that even when research provides solutions these are not necessarily translated into policy and practice health policy and systems research can address any or all of the  ‘building blocks’ of health systems identified in the world health organization’s framework for action on health systems from  namely service delivery information and evidence medical products and technologies health workforce health financing leadership and governance the conceptual framework developed by who proposes four main functions of evidenceinformed policymaking research prioritysetting knowledge generation and dissemination filtering and amplification of evidence and policymaking filtering is a function through which stakeholders determine which research is most relevant as the evidence base for their respective arguments in the policymaking process amplification is a function through which stakeholders seek to make the evidence base of their arguments generally accepted as a means of increasing influence on policymaking this whole framework is supposed to help in developing and evaluating national strategies for enhancing capacity some important new considerations include previous capacity development initiatives have tended to focus exclusively on the production of evidence rather than on capacity to use evidence in policy processes greater investment is needed in assessing whether the currently employed capacitybuilding strategies are effective policymaking is generally a complex nonlinear incremental and messy process many factors have the potential to influence policymaking including  context eg election cycles state of government’s finances health systems governance structures media hype and unforeseen political crises and the ideologies and values of the policymakers themselves indeed although the ‘engineering’ model of how knowledge is incorporated into policy suggests a linear progression from identifying a problem that requires a policy solution to ranking the objectives and weighing alternative policy options this is rarely seen in real life the actual steps of the policy process depend on national features and especially on policy structures and mechanisms nevertheless stages in the policy process typically identified are agenda setting policy formulation implementation and evaluation in fact evidence can be used at any of these stages who has also proposed a tool for selfassessing the effective use of research evidence the tool focuses on four different aspects of organizational capacity each having its implications for staff skills can the organization identify the necessary research can the organization assess its findings in terms of reliability relevance and applicability can the organization present properly the research to decision makers does the organization possess the necessary skills structures processes and culture to promote and use research  at the world health assembly held in geneva in may  debates how to harness health research more effectively in order to achieve the united nations’ millennium development goals in low and middle income countries culminated in the passage of a twopart resolution that established specific accountabilities for developing mechanisms to support the use of research evidence in developing health policy the first part of the resolution called on who member states to “establish or strengthen mechanisms to transfer knowledge in support of evidencebased public health and healthcare delivery systems and evidencebased healthrelated policies’ the second part of the resolution called on who’s directorgeneral to “assist in the development of more effective mechanisms to bridge the divide between ways in which knowledge is generated and ways in which it is used including the transformation of healthresearch findings into policy and practice’ organizations have already been established in many countries and internationally to support the use of research evidence these include among others organizations that directly support the use of research evidence in developing health policy on an international national and provincial level the so called ‘government support units’ while there are important differences among these organizations there are also many commonalities and opportunities for existing and new organizations to learn from this collective experience a recent norwegian study has found seven main implications for those establishing or administering organizations to support the use of research evidence in developing health policy  collaborate with other organizations  establish strong links with policymakers and involve stakeholders in the work  be independent and manage conflicts of interest among those involved in the work  build capacity among those working in the organization  use good methods and be transparent in the work  start small have a clear audience and scope and address important questions  be attentive to implementation considerations even if implementation is not a remit  the study’s four main implications for the world health organization and other international organizations include support collaborations among organizations support local adaptation efforts mobilize support create knowledgerelated global public goods including methods and evidence syntheses  case study the bulgarian experience with all this in mind we decided to analyze the project for a national health strategy  of bulgaria and see how well it corresponds to the principles of an evidence based policy first we would like to make several introductory comments on bulgaria as a country in transition and the health system of bulgaria in particular bulgaria is situated in the eastern part of the balkans and has an approximate population of  million with the demographic characteristics of a rapidly aging society the establishment of a new constitution in  set in motion the process of introducing a democratic form of government despite a large decrease in mortality since  the country’s mortality rate is still high compared to old european union member states mortality rates from heart and circulatory diseases have increased representing  of all deaths in  the infant mortality rate in bulgaria was  per  live births in  which was more than twice as high as that in the  european union member states health reforms commenced in the s brought about wideranging changes in health care organization financing and delivery and a new type of relationship was established between users providers and payers reforms were aimed at making the health system more efficient and responsive to patients’ needs by means of improvements in quality of service and delivery of care the establishment of the national health insurance fund and a basic benefits package defined the services covered by the public sector and designated the revenue collection for health care allowing for more sustainability of the healthcare budget fig  however a financing system solely based on contributions failed to provide adequate funding for the system approximately one million people opting out of universal coverage meant that there were significantly fewer contributors than beneficiaries and this led to potential adverse effects on the financial balance of the national health insurance fund legalization of private practice has had a positive impact on access to health services and the resulting competition among health care providers proved an incentive for higherquality of service provision figure  however widespread commercialization of health care and a growing focus on market relations exerted an overall adverse impact on the social functions of healthcare a restructured primary care and the introduction of gps as gatekeepers to specialized care allowed for costcontainment but led to ardent discussions whether such policies violate the principles of free provision and access to health care for the population the restructuring of inpatient health care financing and provision was followed by the introduction of clinical pathways as a reimbursement instrument this created better incentives for improving both quality and effectiveness of service provision however the actual cost of implementing clinical pathways for the hospital is higher than the price reimbursed by the national health insurance fund which causes chronic financial instability in the inpatient sector insufficient funding of multiprofile hospital settings gave rise to a subsequent lack of motivation among medical  care providers public health challenges and elucidated structural defects of the health system were supposed to be addressed by the new national health strategy of bulgaria figure  overview of the health system of bulgaria  critical evaluation of the last draft of the national health strategy  reveals a number of weaknesses due to the documents’ inconformity with the basic principles  of evidence based policy making the document replicates to a large extent the preceding national health strategy  which in turn replicates the who paper “investment in health’ from the s the project pretends to constitute a health strategy but is in reality an action plan for reforming the healthcare system and is unrelated to the actual public health status of the nation further we will comment on the major weaknesses of this paper in more detail figure  overview of bulgaria’s health system regulation  this is a typical example of a document not based on evidence ie research findings but instead on the opinions of a group of experts or the so called anecdotal evidence the document goes in great detail describing the healthcare system of bulgaria its distinctive features and weak spots but fails to pay any attention to the state of public health and the actual health needs of the citizens of bulgaria such paper is clearly targeted inside at solving problems of structural defects of the health system where it should be targeted outside at tackling the population’s health needs the strategy doesn’t even demonstrate intent to deal with the health and quality of life of bulgarian population instead focusing exclusively on intrinsic problems of the healthcare system a retrospective depiction of the healthcare system and allowed weaknesses is provided while it would be more useful to pinpoint essential problems in the nation’s health state as well as indicate ways of solving them in combination with short and middleterm objectives plus clear indicators for evaluation  the strategy doesn’t engage with a single feasible goal related to improved population health a goal furthermore administratively and financially backed unfortunately the strategy sounds rather like the paper of an administration thinking that public health is entirely a product of the health system’s functioning the proposed strategy neither protects the rights nor defines the healthrelated responsibilities of bulgarian citizens instead it stipulates the way in which according to the ministry of health this system should be structured without taking into account the interests of these same citizens going into even more detail we can easily note that the introduction does not make reference to the health state of the nation but it takes several pages to describe all systemic defects of the healthcare system a strategy with such accent and scope should be named more properly a strategy for restructuring the health system and not a national health strategy a passage states that “the result of this strategy should be a reformed financially stable and effective health system capable of providing quality care in prevention prophylaxis treatment and rehabilitation…’ clearly indicating that the expected outcome is a systemic change and not improved health and quality of life the section “health state of the population’ does not provide actual data instead citing data ranging from  to  which speaks of unfamiliarity with the real health problems of the population this is despite the fact that the last revision of this paper is dated september  this is a good illustration of the point that the national health strategy does not refer to actual health needs and is not founded on scientific evidence the section on social determinants of health sets out a very bad example as it quotes no single result or conclusion instead stating pointlessly that “the relation between health and socioeconomic medium in a state is direct consequently to achieve positive results we need direct actions to improve the medium in which a man lives works and realize his social contacts’ another unfortunate example of the way a strategy is being mechanically filled with meaningless phrases is “realizing the significance and need for timely measures’ in the section “functioning of the healthcare system – system management’ an example of the lack of ability to create a coherent text and “jumping to conclusions’ is the following text taken from the section “financing the health system’ “in comparison to the average parameters of the insurance contribution in the eu which ranges from  to  the insurance contribution in bulgaria is  the combination of low insurance contribution lack of guarantees for complete fundraising and a high dropout rate from the insurance system about mln bulgarian citizens is defining’ the authors of the draft strategy do not leave the impression of truly knowing the bulgarian health system and understanding its hierarchical structure for example they conclude that the increasing number of patients seeking specialist and hospital care can be attributed to a deficit of financial resources in outpatient care the introduction of a uniform emergency number  is erroneously set as a goal of the national health strategy when it is in fact an element of bulgaria’s accession to eu and is of little importance for public health issues in itself throughout the entire text the terms “stomatology” and “dental medicine” are being mixed up according to the new legislation only the use of the second term is correct this mistake may be illustrative of the rash and incoherent manner in which such an important document has been prepared it is a little surprising to find in section “hospital care’ the comment that some hospitals have social functions eg care for terminally ill patients longterm medical  care and continuous rehabilitation as well which depletes their financial resources however these functions are their legal obligation according to bulgarian health legislation the heavy usage of hollow terminology unsupported by concrete examples or proposed measures does not increase the credibility of the document this can be noted on numerous occasions eg with terms used like “creating democratic medium for population inclusion and transparencies in taking political decisions’ “raising capacity of all stakeholders for performing political analyses aimed at improving intersector dialogue’ “forming knowledge base for population health and its determinants’ a striking example of the national strategy’s superfluous and emptied of essence language is the expression “a buildup of a system of criteria for defining priorities in implementing market control based on risk evaluation…’ typical of the proposed strategy is the constant usage of the terms “implementation of a national program’ and “implementation of a national plan’ meaning the strategy has as its goals the realization of certain programs when in reality a strategy is supposed to serve as a basis for establishing such national strategies and action plans high immunization coverage is set as a goal without even specifying what communicable diseases are meant where immunization coverage could be deemed insufficient and what should be achieved in this line of thought all mentions of sociallysignificant diseases go without unequivocally declaring what diseases in bulgaria are meant and what are the related problems for society without even mentioning previously problems of children health and children risk groups in bulgaria the strategy jumps to the establishment of health cabinets in schools ie a structural problem of the health system some technical mistakes raise doubt if the proposed texts have been reviewed after their initial formulation for example the section concerning socially significant diseases confuses program and grant principle of financing – the authors seem unaware of the difference between program planning and participation in financing based on the grant scheme the introduction of a european health insurance card is proposed in the strategy but in fact this card has already been introduced in bulgaria a very disturbing tendency in bulgaria is the preparation of important documents by small groups of lowprofile or completely anonymous experts working hastily on political errands this is how we explain the appearance in the proposed national health strategy of a number of new ideas bringing radical changes to the existing health system it comes as no surprise that immediately after its presentation the draft strategy gave rise to heated disputes several representative examples follow the document introduces a new type of health facilities – one for health tourism unforeseen by the existing bulgarian legislation the strategy indicates an upper limit of  patients in the list of a gp and a number of other measures which have not been discussed with the association of general practitioners in bulgaria like the introduction of stimuli to form group practices again failing to mention any particular and feasible measures and increasing payments for service as well as lowering payments per capita for a listed patient a measure which by the way is clearly going to lead to a surge of costs the section “restructuring and effective management of hospital care’ foresees the establishment of a package of outpatient services to be concluded in hospitals and reimbursed by the health insurance fund which comes again as a surprise since it contradicts all common to this day practice in bulgaria a new type of hospital financing suddenly appears in the text – one through a global budget the  explicitly mentioned regulation and limitation of new contracts of the national health insurance fund with health services providers is an outright violation of the legislation in force and the right of a free initiative for providers this measure if enacted will most probably strip citizens of their right of choice of provider and will exacerbate corruption problems in the bulgarian healthcare system the role of professional organizations like the bulgarian physicians union and the contracting principle in relations between the national health insurance fund and such organizations is completely ignored or nullified throughout the whole text a change in the form of relations is stated without even bothering to mention what will change and why should it change a significant change in the health insurance model is the declared introduction of complementary universal health insurance it remains unclear whether such a step is really necessary and where to should this additional financial resource be directed an interesting goal of the strategy is the creation in bulgaria of a uniform methodology for pricing of medical services such methodology is supposed to serve then as a basis for forming all financial plans in the healthcare sector this sounds like a worthy goal but since such methodology doesn’t exist anywhere else worldwide we get the impression that many declarations in the strategy are present there simply because they sound good the strategy proposes also the refinement of the existing instruments for price formation in hospital care in reality such an attempt will bring forth an even greater dissent among the medical community in bulgaria the currently used clinical pathways which were never meant as financial instruments at their creation proved very unsuccessful perhaps it will be a better idea to abandon them completely and continue with the preparation for the adoption of diagnostic related groups a wide consensus has already been formed on that matter in bulgaria however critical we have been so far the section “indicators for evaluation’ is clearly the weakest part of the strategy curiously the section that should have been most specific and demonstrate the serious intentions of the state in implementing the national strategy contains no single fact or number it remains a mystery how to evaluate the implementation of this strategy when there are no milestones and final goals the standard for monitoring should be described in the strategy but instead we learn form the text that the monitoring mechanism will be created at some later stage the text is abundant in formal phrases like ‘standards for measuring the achieved progress will be in conformity with the set goals the chosen standards should be feasible they will be defined on the basis of concrete data…’ a set of public health indicators is nevertheless enumerated but not a single indication from where we come and where we will end for example birth rate and infant mortality are among the chosen indicators but they are just listed without concrete values even at present and the values we desire to reach in  as a result of the implementation of the national strategy to summarize in our opinion the proposed strategy is elaborated in a very formal manner bears the marks of wishful and bureaucratic thinking does not demonstrate good knowledge of the bulgarian health system and does not live up to the contemporary standards of policy making in developed countries it will be hard to find justification for the existence of this document and the proposed strategy cannot be expected in good conscience to be ever implemented and yield any useful results   the fate of the proposed national health strategy is to this day unenviable perhaps this should come as no surprise in view of its numerous weaknesses  the currently active national health strategy is dated  the enactment of a new health strategy has been the ambition of the bulgarian government dominated by socialists which came in power in  this logical step has been in line with the declared ambitious plans of socialists to restructure public sectors the strategy itself was written in  and is a product of experts working for the ministry of health or affiliated with it an interesting fact is the unwillingness of these experts to have their names associated with this program document consequently it remained an anonymous creation the prime minister made a public promise to have the strategy operational since march  an ambition which proved ungrounded ever since its first presentation end of  in front of a wider audience the strategy attracted only harsh critiques it has been consequently rejected by all stakeholders in bulgaria’s healthcare sector one such example follows the document was presented by the minister of health on may   in front of an extended national council of the bulgarian physicians union including also representatives of the academic community ministers deputies and representatives of patients’ organizations following the discussion the national council made a statement rejecting the proposed strategy and citing its numerous weaknesses the bulgarian physicians union considers a main weakness the preparation of the strategy without any participation from physicians and patients other cited weaknesses coincide to a great extent with our own findings health needs priorities and concrete steps are omitted form the strategy furthermore the strategy speaks of essential administrative reforms in bulgarian healthcare without a preceding proper public discussion financial parameters are missing the national council proposed scrapping the existing project and the preparation of new one by a workgroup including representatives from the ministry of health the bulgarian physicians union and patients’ organizations the final draft should contain clear responsibilities of all institutions implementing the strategy as well as explicitly stated terms and necessary resources  in  the draft of the new national health strategy has been rejected three times by the council of ministers regardless the strategy draft is proposed again and again with minor corrections a good indication of the limited capacity of the ministry of health in preparing such documents discussion the technology traditionally used widely in bulgaria to prepare important political documents is outdated and the case of the national health strategy  clearly illustrates that institutional capacity – the ability of government experts to find and incorporate evidence is very weak and so is interface – the ability of these experts to communicate with the academic community as a possible source of such evidence wider adoption of the principles of evidence based policy making can do much to advance bulgarian health policy references

theoretical background introduction health technology is a complex issue it is the ground for effective health protection prevention and treatment of diseases diminishing of people’s pains and sufferings and above all supporting human development economic prosperity and quality of life in the same time it is important as powerful health industry consuming considerable social and economic resources of all countries “technology” has different meanings techne greek word means art skill craft the practical meanings today are industrial science applied science any practical art utilizing scientific knowledge in practice it is connected with physical objects machines mechanical tools chemical agents computers sometimes called hardware equipment instruments and gadgets today the term includes also social methods and knowhow even people who work with them and organization of work called also software procedures and techniques in the working material of the almaata conference  it was stated ”technology is the totality of methods techniques and equipment together with the people using them” health technology was and is now the basis of health culture closely related with it historical development of technology is the consequence of general technical economic social and cultural development and circumstances but also contributing to understanding of human beings and supporting development of other technologies especially biotechnologies historically one may differentiate big medical schools like ayurvedic chinese unani arabic african south american cloister medicine… besides there always and today existed traditional and popular folk medicine traditional medicine and traditional healers are known as herbalists bonesetters spiritual healers traditional birth attendances broadly spread and more active is popular folk indigenous fringe medicine and selfcare a combination of tradition popular believes interpretation of experiences of people with official health care and at present also marketing messages about drugs natural products “healthy diets” etc “scientific” biomedical medicine and professionally trained health workers today occupy the dominant official position although their position is in practice shared with folk medicine complementary and alternative medicine and trade of different kinds of healers basically contemporary health practice is based on an allopathic approach to medicine treating abnormalities by procedures with opposite effect than the signs of disease are showing aiming to reach normal balance new big expectations are vibrant today by new scientific successes in genetics biomolecular techniques nanotechnologies and new knowledge about human genome however the big expectations should not stop small steps forward in medicine in all directions scientific dreams and realistic empiricism have to progress together  kinds and types of health technologies the kind of technology one may divide according to purpose of their use from supporting longevity and promoting health to cure and rehabilitation restoring of functions the tendency today is to speak about prevention and mostly cure of illnesses notion of social determinants of health is and was suppressed long time for political reasons particularly in practical health activities the same is with a dream about longevity asking for more years to be added to life instead of looking for more life to be added to years the same is shown by orientation towards diseases contributing to mortality and not enough attention paid to rehabilitation and diseases producing handicaps and poor quality of life the mixture of types of health technologies is of great interest for practice of health services within the complex health technology one could identify three broad types of interventions using very different approaches and run increasingly by specialists medical specialists and healers who a very far one of another eg psychiatrists and priests from biochemists and cytologists however often and even usually these different types of health technologies have to be combined together and integrated if one would try to achieve best results the broadly defined types of health technologies are  human care and support including psychotherapy and spiritual medicine  drugs biological and chemical medicaments including biochemical diagnostics  physical medicine and surgery including “imaging” diagnostics in a way this division is following the division of traditional medicine magicians spiritual healers herbalists and bonesetter today the second group particularly pharmacological treatment absolutely predominates in health practice particularly because the first type of technologies human care and support is diminishing in spite of growing needs and requests the first type of technologies is therefore increasingly more present in all kinds of alternative medical services as well as in all kinds of malpractices  another useful division of health technologies is according to objects of application individuals groups communities general public and environment for instance to solve the problem of alcoholism one may choose and combine individual treatment group work familial approach health education of community andor change in environment production and prices of alcoholic beverages new social way of entertainment etc very important division of health technologies is according to cost of equipment per workplace the economist ef schumacher stated in his book “small is beautiful economics as if people mattered”  “if we define the level of technology in terms of “equipment cost per workplace” we can call the indigenous technology of a typical developing country – symbolically speaking – a onepound technology while that of developed countries could be called a pound technology the gap between these two technologies is so enormous that a transition from one to the other is simply impossible in fact a current attempt of developing countries to infiltrate the pound technology into their economies inevitably kills off the onepound technology at an alarming rate destroying traditional workplaces much faster than modern workplaces can be created and thus leaves the poor in a more desperate and helpless position than ever before if the effective help is to be  brought to those who need it most a technology is required which would range in some intermediate position between the onepound technology and pound technology let us call it – again symbolically speaking – pound technology” this statement written many years ago is still valid and not only for very poor countries than also for middle developed countries the technology used at the primary level in primary health care both in developed and developing countries should be an intermediate cost technology pound technology there are three additional questions important for appropriate use of technologies in practice at appropriate technology for actual needs ta technology assessment and monitoring its use tt technology transfer and its influence appropriate technology at appropriate technology is technology that is designed or chosen with special consideration to the environmental ethical cultural social and economical aspects of the community it is intended for such technology usually requires fewer resources is easier to maintain and has a lower overall cost and less of an impact on the environment compared to industrialized practices appropriate technology usually prefers in developing countries labourintensive solutions over capitalintensive ones and it is quite opposite in developed countries laboursaving devices should be used when this does not mean high capital or maintenance cost in industrialized nations the term appropriate technology often refers to engineering that takes special consideration of its social and environmental ramifications in practice it is often solution that might be described as using the simplest level of technology that can effectively achieve the intended purpose in a particular location in deciding about appropriateness seven main dimensions have to be observed safety efficiency efficacy technical properties organizational impact social consequences and ethical implications observations and experiences in practice as well as research have shown that appropriate technology will have the following characteristics • should be scientifically verified • adaptive to local needs • acceptable to those who apply it • acceptable to those who use it • easy maintenance • it must be economically affordable technology assessment ta in order to evaluate the level of appropriateness of applied or a new technology it has to be reviewed by a process known as technology assessment the term technology assessment was introduced in  during deliberations of the committee on science and astronautics of the us house of representatives and it was emphasized that the purpose of ta is to serve policymaking in case of health technologies the first “old” approach that it has to serve professionals in health practice and only later when the problem of rising costs became unavoidable the “new” assessment went into hands of health politicians and financial authorities the tension about for  whom technology should be assessed is present even know as a wellknown struggle of clinicians and administrators about professional autonomy the third player started to be visible in shape of powerful industries producing equipment biological products and drugs as a judge finally public and users have been asked to join but even now although “needbased” principles have been established they remain weak partner table  methods of assessment of health technologies  for whom measures main criteria “old ”  “new” now “needbased” for clinicians and experts for government and politicians for public and users • • safety efficacy • • quality of life feasibility • • relevance social impact the procedure by which the given technology is systematically examined if it is appropriate for existing health needs and other in accordance with other circumstance includes the following pertinent questions and ways how to answer them • is it necessary answer by estimating prevalence and priority of needs • is it effective consider efficacy potentials under optimal circumstances coverage and compliance acting of patients in accordance with the rules in practice • is it efficient answer by estimating cost in relation with effects is it affordable and sustainable • is it safe answer by measuring adversary reactions and consequences there are also experienced suggestions what are the main issues in assessment see more by eisenberg jm    health practitioners should give a lead what and how might be implemented the assessment has to be done in circumstances in which it will be applied  the assessment has to be performed repeatedly once is not enough  the last and most important goal of assessment should be improvement of existing health practice the technology assessment is an activity ensuring quality of care and progress of services it is under strong pressure of economic constraints producers professionals and public opinion a balance has to be found between conservative tendencies toward standardization restrictions and destimulation and innovative policies stimulating and propagating new technologies the abbreviation sti means science  technology  innovation the new technology has to be connected with new training of people and also often with reorganization of work itself it is important not to forget that the  management itself has its own technologies which can also be judged as appropriate or inappropriate for the given circumstances transfer of health technology tt globalization is increasing the processes of technology transfer many producers of medical equipment and drugs are now big multinational health companies however the system is biased so that technology as well as science are oriented towards needs of more developed and more powerful part of the world it can be illustrated by a quotation from who document  gaps in pharmaceutical research and innovation the world health organization released a groundbreaking report which recommends ways in which pharmaceutical research and innovation can best address health needs and emerging threats in europe and the world the  priority conditions identified by the report are future public health threats  infections due to antibacterial resistance  pandemic influenza diseases for which better formulations are required  cardiovascular disease secondary prevention  diabetes  postpartum hemorrhages  paediatric hivaids  depression in the elderly and adolescents diseases for which biomarkers are absent  alzheimer disease  osteoarthritis diseases for which basic and applied research is required  cancer  acute stroke neglected diseases or areas  tuberculosis  malaria and other  tropical infectious diseases such as trypanosomiasis leishmaniasis and buruli ulcer  hiv vaccine diseases for which prevention is particularly effective  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including smoking cessation  alcohol use disorders alcoholic liver diseases and alcohol dependency the successful technology transfer by itself presents problems for which the solutions are not always easy the un millenium project on science technology and innovation background paper  reviewed literature concluding that messages are pessimistic but in the same time full of hope the important problems in technology transfer are • intrusive influence of political and economic relations with domination of powerful • impossible transfer if local capacities to whom technology is transferred are not developed • conflicts of interest between and inside countries inside and between professional groups • local policies such as protecting autarchy of countries autonomies of experts and control of outs of transfer by powerful groups criminal organizations and corrupted administration  case study the estimates of use of technologies in europe and problems of drugs management in croatia there are estimates that in europe might be spent  of health expenditures for performed health procedures and applied technologies without evidence of their effectiveness and only   interventions in daily use were proven by controlled experiments polypragmatic use of drugs misuse of antibiotics overuse of painkillers and all kinds of sedatives are convincing examples there is also evidence that there are socially determined differences what is particularly evident in diagnostic and hightech technologies some studies indicate that eve   of technologies is irrelevant or applied and used in inappropriate way the poor compliance with drug prescriptions is documented in many cases the symbolic use of technologies is described in cases when results of expensive laboratory tests and diagnostic examinations were never used for medical decisions misuse of technologies is also seen in the opposite situations when many useless tests screening procedures and diagnostic procedures are ordered unnecessary in routine health services the ineffective technologies are applied and systematically protected see banta hd

aleksandar džakula theoretical background community and public health throughout the sixties seventies and eighties much of the rhetoric in public health paid lip service to the value of a community empowerment communitybased care populationbased needs assessment and so on but we could not see much of the evidence of this commitment in the daytoday service provision of practitioners or in design applied in public health interventions potential contributions from the social sciences tend to be overwhelmed by the appeal of the biomedical and behavioural sciences the most common notion of community in public health was the most simple – a lots and lots of people or community as the population this notion is illustrated in largescale community interventions propelled by the concern to reach as many people as possible and make best use of scarce program resources the outcome evaluation of these interventions usually amounts to summing up changes made by individuals in relation to the problem of interest the greater the number of people who change the more successful is the intervention  the second approach to community borne out of the first could be described as community as “giant reinforcement schedule” or community as setting with aspects of that setting being used as levers to support and maintain individual behaviour change in this approach organizations groups and key individuals in the community are valued because of their capacity to translate the health messages of the campaign into the local culture the evaluation of this model rests principally on aggregating changes made by individuals in the population  the third newest approach developed throughout the nineties sees community as “ecosystem with capacity to work towards solutions to its own community identified problems” or to see it as a social system this notion of community focused on strengths instead merely on deficits the evaluation in these case attempts to capture changes in community processes and structures as outcomes  two groups of research activities systematic study of communities and inequality research supported with evidence from many applied researches done through development of european healthy cities project contributed to this shift in perception of the value of the community inequality research firstly we acknowledge that people do not live in vacuum the notion that behaviour is greatly influenced by social context in which people lead their lives has finally get through to public health practitioners many sociologists have argued that the lives of individuals are affected not only by their personal characteristics but also by characteristics of the social group their belong  they say that “lifestyle” and “behaviours” were regarded as matters of free individual choice and dissociated from the social context that shape and constrain them  with their work they confronted  prevalent the “web of causation” model and blame it for progressive “individualization” of risk ie attributing risk to characteristics of individuals rather than to environmental or social influences affecting populations simultaneously tremendous shift in value position from victim blaming through relative status in social milieu to density of links and caring in a social structure has been done through the evolution of causal explanations of inequalities  the traditional explanation of inequalities in health is that they are caused by the behaviour of those from the lower socioeconomic classes who drink smoke and generally engage in too many “risk behaviours” leading to their early demise from heart disease lung cancer and so on the solution is therefore to modify their risky behaviours and so antismoking campaigns and other health promotion programs were launched unfortunately historical data shows that such inequalities are independent of the causes of death and they are as prevalent now as they were when the main causes of death were entirely different at the run of the past century the next level of explanation is that the inequality is caused by the material deprivation suffered by those in the lower socioeconomic groups – poor housing poor nutrition inadequate heating air pollution inadequate access to care and so on the solution therefore is to provide income or other resource support to the poor in society enough to raise them above some declared level of deprivation although there is undoubtedly some truth to this proposed causal model marmot’s data from the british civil service study tells us that it is far from the whole story  across five classes of civil servants all of whom are “welloff” there are marked inequalities in health none suffer what could be called “deprivation” so aside from the evidence on absolute deprivation there is growing evidence that the relative distribution of income in a society matters in its own right for population health this next level of explanation was given by wilkinson  in his research he found strong negative association between the degree of income inequality in a country and its health as measured by mortality statistics here the model proposed is that the feelings of relative deprivation among those in the lower half of the income distribution express themselves through neuroimmunological systems as disease and death the larger the differences the more likely and the more severe are the negative health consequences low control insecurity and loss of selfesteem are among the psychosocial risk factors known to mediate between health and socioeconomic circumstances exposure to chronic mental and emotional stress associated with social position will increase probability of acquiring risky behaviours  stress related smoking drinking eating “for comfort” etc the implied solution in this case would be development of more egalitarian society eg the reduction in income inequalities by better distribution of wealth in society this level of explanation has been pushed one step further by work of kennedy and kawachi  in the american study by kennedy income inequality at the state level was strongly correlated with total mortality income inequality was measured in that study by the robin hood index which is the proportion of aggregate income that needs to be redistributed from the rich to the poor so as to achieve equality of income a  rise in the robin hood index was associated with an excess mortality of  deaths per   suggesting that even a modest reduction in inequality could have an important impact on populations health the maldistribution of income was related not only to total mortality but also to infant mortality homicides and deaths from cardiovascular diseases and neoplasm in an independent study kaplan  examined  the association between income inequality – as measured by the share of aggregated income earned by the bottom  of households – and state level variations in total mortality a strong association was found between their measure of income inequality and ageadjusted total mortality rates in  moreover the degree of income inequality in each state in  was a powerful predictor of levels of total mortality  years later the repeated corroboration of the hypothesis that income inequality is harmful to health has spurred the search for the pathways and mechanisms underlying this relation one hypothesis was that rising income inequality results in increased level of frustration which may have deleterious behavioural and health consequences societies that permit large disparities in income to develop also tend to be the ones that under invest in human capital eg education health care and other factors that promote health the growing gap between the rich and the poor has led to declining levels of social cohesion and trust or disinvestments in “social capital” social capital has been defined as the features of social organization such as civic participation norms of reciprocity and trust in others that facilitate cooperation for mutual benefit social capital is thus a community level variable whose counterpart at the individual level is measured by person’s social networks the core concept of social capital according to its principal theorists putnam consists of civic engagement and levels of mutual trust among community members so by connecting levels of civic trust perceived levels of fairness and helpfulness and density of associational membership with degree of income inequity on one side and mortality on other kawachi isolated social capital as a mediating mechanism the work of kaplan kennedy and kawachi is telling us that the growing gap between the rich and the poor affects the social organization of communities and that the resulting damage to the social fabric may have profound implications for public’s health although the role of economic characteristics in relationship between social capital and health has not been thoroughly elucidated veenstra  contemporary public health tend to focus less on the individual and more on the social system’s influence on health accepting that “the way we organize our society the extent to which we encourage interaction among the citizenry and the degree to which we trust and associate with each other in caring communities is probably the most important determinant of our health”  “system” study of communities during the last few decades’ significant work has been done by social scientists engaged in the systematic study of communities from this work at least two important principles can be identified  the first relates to definitions of community and the second applies a “system” perspective to communities the first approach to community is based on notion that communities form a whole greater than the assemblage of individuals within them the community components include locality an interdependent social group interpersonal relationship and a culture that includes values norms and attachments to the community as a whole as well to its parts the second system view sees communities simply as a system which includes individuals subsystems and the interrelationship among the subsystems anthropologists have identified important subsystems of any community system political sector religious sector recreational sector and social welfare sector in addition community organization studies have identified two additional sectors being important for achieving changes in the community system voluntary and civic groups such as healthrelated agencies political action  groups and other grassroots groups and other groups that may be specific to particular community from a system perspective a change in one sector usually implies that adjustment or response will eventually occur in other parts of the system change that begins with one sector however may take a long time to affect the entire system in addition many factors may interrupt of divert the change effort from a community organization perspective the target of change is generally the entire system – the community itself from this perspective it is not enough to change only a sector or part of the community although changes in the sectors or subsystems especially the political or economic spheres may contribute to overall system change sanders  delineate the following community components economic institutions local government health education social welfare religion recreation social networks the family and social groupings each component could be subdivided and number of community units may be expanded endlessly rothman  defines social participation as a core element of social health and for him socially healthy community is the one sufficiently endowed with a matrix of social units that allow participation in his opinion policymaking unit decisionmaking bodies are critical components of the entire community system because improving the social or physical health of any population group may require health promotion policies those policies could  help individuals change their own personal health related behaviours  reduce environmental obstacles to healthpromoting behaviour and or  reduce or eliminate factors in the physical or social environment that are detrimental to health conscious individual action can be facilitated by “microstrategies” like for example teaching low income people to prepare nutritious meals using inexpensive food often such individual behaviours are discouraged by environmental conditions such are high prices for more nutritious foods introducing food stamps was kind of policy designed for example to reduce economic environmental barriers to nutritious diet finally environmental hazards may be eliminated by “macrostrategies” eg “technological bypass” – by changing potentially detrimental experience of individuals without their direct involvement like for example legislative action that could lower pricing of more nutritious as compared to less nutritious food decisionmaking units may be favourable neutral or unfavourable to establishing relevant policies on the issue if unfavourable considerable community effort may be required a wide scope of community units may need to be mobilized and political pressure tactics may be necessary even if the decisionmaking body is favourable substantial community organization may be required as resources are always scarce and competing claims inundate those with decisionmaking power and responsibility the source of initiation of the policy change for example relatively powerless citizens elite group or established health professionals or organization may shape the form of community action rothman  described three general forms of community intervention locality development social planning and social action the first one maximizes local participation ownership the second emphasizes rational planning and problem solving and the third uses mobilization and activation of disadvanced groups as a part of the effort to influence local public policy community has to get organized brown’s model of community organization for action  comprises four phases – preorganizational conditions community organization policy influence and policy decision first phase a preorganizational condition includes needs predisposition to organize and enabling resources factors for organizing second phase community organization includes process of organized action technical support and  expanded outside the constituency support and opposition third phase policy influence identifies and described the target of community action receptivity of policymaking body and noncommunity external factors and fourth phase policy decision represents the culmination of the whole process the extend to which policies have been changed according to objectives of the initial action by offering nine categories of indicators to describe community organization’s efforts to influence local public policy brown’s model is helping us to develop better understanding of mechanisms of community action enables monitoring of process of change and teach us what forms and strategies of community action may be most effective in promoting health another very useful concept for public health practitioners is the one developed by partick and wickizer  they explained that the social system in a community relevant to health consists of at least three elements physical structure social structure and social cohesion a community’s physical structure urban planning the design of suburban housing developments parks and green areas industry has both direct influences on health through exposure to risk and indirect influences on health through the creation or neglect of healthinducing environments social structure in a community is reflected in such things as its meeting places mechanisms for income redistribution sports leagues clubs associations and all the elements of a community that allow for the exchange of views and values and engender mutual trust this too has both direct effects on health and indirect through facilitating collective problem solving or collective identity finally social cohesion is very much the product of the adequacy of physical and social structure in a community along with such things as the cultural or social homogeneity of a community physical and social structure can either encourage or discourage mutual support and caring selfesteem and sense of belonging and enriched social relationship all of these have been shown largely by social scientists to have an influence on the health of a community’s members case study community applied research in croatia  “triggered” by healthy cities during the eighteen years of the healthy cities project existence in europe much of the earlier mentioned “theory” has been learned experientially the healthy cities hc project initiated by the who european office in  is a longterm international development project that seeks to put health on the agenda of decisionmakers in cities and to build a strong lobby for public health at the local level the crucial notion that stimulates hc project development was the recognition of importance of the political will the healthy cities project challenges cities to take seriously the process of developing health–enhancing public policies that create physical and social environments that support health and strengthen community action for health initiating the healthy cities project process requires explicit political commitment and consensus across party political lines leading to sound project infrastructure clear strategy participation mechanisms and broadlybased ownership  healthy cities is about change openness to participation innovation and formal system reorientation it is changing the ways in which individuals communities private and voluntary organizations and local governments think about understand and make decisions about health  european cities in general are challenged with complex public health issues like poverty violence social exclusion pollution substandard housing the unmet needs of elderly and young people homeless people and migrants unhealthy spatial planning the lack of participatory practices and unsustainable development  due to the war and postwar transition croatian cities are faced with many others like for example mental health posttraumatic disorders quality of life of disabled family health community regeneration and community capacity building unemployment especially among young and mid career workers stress alcohol tobacco and substance misuse etc  the healthy cities project framework provided the testing ground for applying new strategies and methods for addressing these issues in croatia in the early s migrations caused by war undermined the credibility of the dominant positivist perspective of demographic analyses statistical studies and quantitative health indicators  all health indicators obtained at that time were based on estimates of a key factor – population quantitative data collected by national health institutions croatian institute of public health croatian health insurance institute and ministry of health mainly produced mortality and morbidity statistics which was of some use only for national health policy makers  in addition to its dubious credibility national health statistics had other shortcomings poor accessibility of indicators at the local level and noninclusion of the opinion of the community  due to postwar conditions scarce assets and the need to determine the state of affairs and launch the action as soon as possible the method of rapid appraisal  was chosen for the community health needs assessment and development of the strategic city health documents the city health profile and city action plan for health  the most popular and most used method in the croatian cities is the method of rapid appraisal to assess community health needs  it was used in  cities between  and  pula metkovic rijeka karlovac varazdin zagreb split dubrovnik crikvenica the advantages of this method in comparison with classical approaches to health assessment are as follows it can be done quickly in two months from the start it does not take too much expert time and financial resources approximately  eur per city it is participatory representatives of different groups of citizens participate in the process from needs identification to solution finding includes representatives of city authorities institutions and organizations as well as those from nongovernmental and nonforprofit sector sensitive ability to reflect local particularities valid scientifically sound actionoriented as a product it gives shortterm and longterm plan activity plan and its achievements are sustainable it establishes and facilitates cooperation among key stakeholders in the project via priority thematic groups academic credibility of described needs assessment method was strengthened by the establishment of strict selection rules of participants and panellists and by the process of triangulation of both information sources essays observations and collected objective indicators from the system and researchers experts of three different backgrounds public health epidemiology and medical information science qualitative analytical approach also was used in development of the model of rapid appraisal of effectiveness of public health interventions  a retrospective study of  successfully performed interventions in five cities – liverpool uk sandwell uk vienna austria pula croatia and rijeka croatia – identified the  indicators of intervention effectiveness that could be used to asses the effect of an intervention in a short period of time within a time frame of  years from the beginning of the intervention by measuring several aspects of success these are as follows  effect on political environment macroenvironment – assessment of the achieved degree of change in political environment  effect on a project user – an individual a group a community within the meaning of empowering users and influencing health  effect on a project manager – an organization or institution ie an association or group microenvironment and  monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation process of an intervention the instrument happened to be more applicable for measuring the success of individual population or topictargeted interventions in the evaluation of effectiveness of comprehensive yearslong interventions such as healthy city or healthy county it is applied together with other evaluation instruments concluding remarks the job of public health professionals including those in academic setting is not only to investigate and understand the world it is also to change it this is why we in croatia put the emphasis on the development of applied action research by which the academic knowledge may be used for intensifying activities and development of local communities the introduction of participatory methods and consensus building techniques in the process of public health policy formulation in croatia has brought much better understanding and improved collaboration among “policy stakeholders”  politicians administration public health professionals and community public health professionals are more responsive and committed to work with communities to support them to regenerate local social capital at the moment croatian healthy cities and counties greatest achievement is that community participation is assured in all stages of planning and

second report   screening is a public health service in which members of a defined population who do not necessarily perceive they are at risk of or are already affected by a disease or its complications are asked a question or offered a test to identify those individuals who are more likely to be helped than harmed by further tests or treatment to reduce the risk of a disease or its complications there have been various definitions of screening over the years  but put simply what we are talking about in screening is seeking to identify a disease or predisease condition in apparently healthy individuals this concept is now widely accepted in most of the developed word when used wisely it can be a powerful tool in the prevention of a disease screening has important ethical differences from clinical practice the health service is targeting apparently healthy people offering to help individuals to make better informed decisions about their health irrespective that screening has the potential to save lives or improve quality of life through early diagnosis of serious conditions it is not a foolproof process screening can reduce the risk of developing a condition or its complications but it cannot offer a guarantee of protection in any screening programme there is an irreducible minimum of false positive results wrongly reported as having the condition and false negative results wrongly reported as not having the condition screening programmes screening programmes are public health services that are organized at the level of a large population and must be effectively monitored programmes must use research evidence to identify that they do more good than harm at a reasonable cost proposed new screening programmes should be assessed against a set of internationally recognised criteria these criteria include the epidemiology of the condition the screening test any treatment options and the acceptability of the screening programme the benefits of screening for disease prevention were first demonstrated in the s by the use of mass miniature radiography mmr for the identification of individuals with tuberculosis tb after the end of the second world war when effective treatment for tb was introduced the use of mmr became widespread in many western countries in  who issued monograph principles and practice of screening for disease  which remains a landmark contribution to the screening literature  types of screening it is important to distinguish between two main types of screening being organized screening and opportunistic screening their main characteristics are as follows   • organized screening is a process in which people thought to be at risk are invited for screening inside organized screening programme as in the national programmes for cancer of the breast and cervix for example it takes place in a community setting it could be checked and monitored • in contrast opportunistic screening is screening offered by a medical doctor or other health professional outside an organized screening programme unlike an organised screening programme opportunistic screening may not be checked or monitored screening need to be distinguished from casefinding where individuals have sought medical advice for a specific symptom or complaint and opportunity is taken to suggest various other tests such as the measurement of blood pressure or cholesterol appropriate to their age and sex   it takes place in a clinical setting criteria for screening before screening for any condition is introduced the basic criteria have to be fulfilled table   they are fundamental to the integrity of the screening process in any country table  summary of criteria for screening  category criteria condition the condition sought should be an important health problem whose natural history including development from latent to declared disease is adequately understood the condition should have a detectable preclinical phase there should be a defined target population target population diagnosis treatment cost screening test there should be a suitable diagnostic test that is available safe and acceptable to the population concerned there should be an agreed policy based on respectable test findings and national standards as to whom to regard as patients and the whole process should be a continuing one there should be an accepted and established treatment or intervention for individuals identified as having the disease or predisease condition and facilities for treatment should be available the cost of casefinding including diagnosis and treatment should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole should be acceptable and safe  the validity of screening test and the evaluation of screening validity validity of screening tests is an expression of a degree to which a test measures what it intends to measure  there are two measures to describe the validity of screening test – sensitivity and specificity both measures are conditional probabilities and both are easy to understand using a decision matrix figure   true disease status test results present absent positive a b ab negative c d cd ac bd figure  decision matrix for derivation of the validity analysis of a screening test  sensitivity sensitivity nosological is defined as the ability of a test to detect all those with the disease in the screened population this is expressed as the proportion of those with the disease in whom a screening test gives a positive result technically it is a proportion of people with condition with positive test aac table   specificity specificity is defined as the ability of a test to identify correctly those free of the disease in the screened population this is expressed as a proportion of people free of the disease in whom the screening test gives a negative result technically it is a proportion of people without condition with negative test aac table  but one should be aware interpreting these measures since there are two kinds of sensitivity and specificity  nozological and diagnostic  so far we were speaking of nosological conditional probabilities other two important conditional probabilities are positive and negative predictive values   positive predictive value positive predictive value is the probability that a person with a negative test does not have the condition under screening technically it is a proportion of people with positive test who have condition aab table  this measure is also known as diagnostic specificity  negative predictive value negative predictive value is the probability that a person with a negative test does not have the condition under screening technically it is a proportion of people with negative test who do not have condition dcd table  this measure is also known as diagnostic sensitivity all screening tests should aim to have high sensitivity and high specificity  evaluation evaluation must also be an integral part of any screening procedure in  cochrane and holland suggested seven criteria for evaluation and these remain as valid today as they were then  table  table  summary of criteria for evaluation of screening  factor criteria simplicity the test should be simple to perform easy to interpret and where possible capable of use by paramedics and other personnel since participation in screening is voluntary the test must be acceptable to those undergoing it the test must give a true measurement of the condition or symptom under investigation the expense of the test must be considered in relation to the benefits of early detection of the disease the test should give consistent results in repeated trials the test should be capable of giving a positive finding when the individual being screened has the condition being sought the test should be capable of giving a negative finding when the individual being screened does not have the condition being sought acceptability accuracy cost repeatability sensitivity specificity benefits and disadvantages the benefits and disadvantages of screening have been fully described over the years and have been summarized by chamberlain  table  table  benefits and disadvantages of screening  benefits disadvantages improved prognosis for cases detected longer morbidity in cases where prognosis is unaltered overtreatment of questionable abnormalities less radical treatment which cures some early cases resource savings reassurance for those with negative test results resource costs false reassurance for those with falsenegative results anxiety and sometimes morbidity for those with false positive results hazard of screening test itself  benefits the benefits are very clear early and accurate diagnosis and intervention will lead to an improved prognosis in some patients at this stage treatment may need to be less invasive  disadvantages  the disadvantages are more complex there will be longer periods of morbidity for patients whose prognosis is unchanged and there may be overtreatment of nonserious conditions or abnormalities identified there are also resource costs in finding more illness both in terms of the tests themselves the personnel costs and the subsequent management of whatever is found there is the unpalatable certainty that some individuals with falsenegative results will be given unfounded reassurance and that some with false positive results will experience at the very least unnecessary anxiety and at the worst inappropriate treatment finally there is the possibility however remote of hazard from the screening test itself one point is particularly relevant here  there may be public demand fuelled by vested interests for the introduction of a screening test that does not meet the established criteria an example of this is in screening for cancer of the prostate where the current screening test – prostatespecific antigen psa – does not meet the criteria for accuracy or specificity key issues in screening there are a number of issues that are relevant at all stages and in every type of screening programme in any country and are closely interrelated there are five key issues in screening being genetics information economics ethics and audit evaluation and quality control figure  genetics information economics key issues in screening ethics audit evaluation and quality control figure  five key issues of screening before discussing the above mentioned key issues one should consider components of an effectively organized screening programme the components as described by hakama  are as follows • the target population should be identified • individuals in the population who are to be screened need to be identified • all those eligible for screening should be encouraged to attend – for example by issuing a personal invitation and offering suitable timing of screening examinations to suit the needs of those involved  • there should be adequate premises equipment and staff to ensure that the screening examination is done under pleasant circumstances and is acceptable to those attending • there should be an appropriate satisfactory method of ensuring the maintenance of the best standards of the tests by − initial and continuing training of the personnel conducting the tests − demonstration by appropriate records of the maintenance standards of equipment used in the examination – for example calibration of xray machines in mammography − routine checks of the validity of the tests performed – for example random duplicate measurements for biochemistry cytology and reading of xrays • there should be adequate and appropriate facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of any individual found to require this there should be as little delay as possible between the screening attendance advice that the screening test was negative advice that the screening test result required further investigation and referral to the appropriate centre for further investigation or treatment a timetable should be established for these different procedures and there should be continuous monitoring to ensure that the time intervals between the various stages are complied with • there should be regular checks to ascertain the satisfaction level of those who have undergone the screening process – those investigated the screennegatives and those invited who have not participated • finally regular periodic checks should be made of the records of the screened individuals to ascertain their adequacy genetics in the last decade genetic screening has developed very rapidly with the mapping of the human genome many see it as opening up a new era in the prevention early diagnosis and identification of disease however caution is essential  there are two objectives of screening for a recessive carrier state one is to reduce the prevalence of the disorder and the other is to inform the reproductive choices of individuals and couples at risk information is thus regarded as worthwhile in itself regardless of the possibility of prevention or treatment while this type of screening can certainly help to evaluate risk and may be appropriate in certain highrisk groups it should be carefully considered when to screen if nothing can be done after the results of the screening test  the main purpose of genetic screening at present is to prevent in this it differs from much current screening practice and it must not be allowed to overlook the basic principles and criteria of screening  information information is another central concept in modern health care in general and also in screening it must be provided in a correct way so that possible participant may decide upon proper information with the endpoint being truly informed consent or refusal to participate   economics as economic theory has entered the field it has been recognized that screening may also do harm all screening procedures involve the examination and testing of large numbers of individuals in order to find the few with an abnormality there are two main consequences of this  first those who undergo screening are often understandably anxious while waiting for the result and become even more anxious if they have to undergo further investigation second although most screening tests are simple relatively cheap procedures in themselves the actual costs are by no means trivial because of the large numbers involved  ethics any abnormality identified whether in a national screening programme or in primary care must be treatable and the investigation itself must not cause harm many believe that early diagnosis particularly of cancer and heart disease will lead to the possibility of treatment and improvement in prognosis this is an attractive concept and can lead to a demand for a screening procedure to be introduced irrespective of whether it has been shown that diagnosis guarantees an improved outcome  audit evaluation and quality control in any screening programme as with any other service programme adequate steps must be taken to ensure that the original objectives are being met and that the methodology meets appropriate standards  the ideal method for evaluating a screening programme is the randomized controlled trial in which individuals in a population are allocated at random either to a group that is screened or to a group that receives only its normal medical care  the components of an effectively organized screening programme have been described by hakama  and have been already presented earlier in this module the importance of maintaining the quality of screening programmes should never be underestimated evaluation audit and quality control should be an integral part of any screening programme to ensure that it is achieving what it has set out to do in a way that is acceptable to those involved the recommended screenings in europe there are several recommended screenings in europe  they may be presented through different age groups being • antenatal period • neonatal period • screening in childhood • screening in adolescence and early adulthood  • screening in adults and • screening in elderly recommended screenings by age groups  antenatal period there are many routine screenings for the total population and some screenings for high risk groups table  there are

interest in health is insatiable and anyone who reads the newspapers watches television or listens to radio can hardly fail to be aware of the various diseases that may be lying in wait for them of course it is of benefit if potential  health problems can be identified early and treated but society must beware of turning health into an obsession and must resist both the increasing medicalization of life and the growing politicization of medicine the national programmes for breast and cervical cancer should be continued but kept under review with an emphasis on quality control and on providing balanced and understandable information to enable women to make a truly informed choice without pressure from health professionals on whether or not to participate a national programme of screening for colorectal cancer by faecal occult blood testing in adults aged from  to  years has been agreed in the united kingdom and on some other european countries but it is essential that adequate diagnostic treatment and followup facilities are in place before it is introduced screening for risk factors of coronary heart disease and stroke should be carried out in the primary care setting with advice treatment and followup as appropriate in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm it now seems clear that ultrasound screening in men aged  years and over would reduce mortality from this condition although the benefit for those aged over  years has been questioned as with colorectal cancer however national implementation should await the certainty that adequate facilities and resources are available in the case of screening for diabetic retinopathy close attention must be paid to audit and the need to be absolutely clear about how when and where to screen  elderly society is facing a major challenge in how best to maintain health and quality of life in populations where the proportion of people aged over  years now outnumbers those aged under  and the number of individuals aged over  is rising a system of regular surveillance and casefinding in primary care would seem to be the most appropriate form of screening particularly in those aged  and over but the resource implications of this must be confronted several simple tests such as identifying difficulties with sight or hearing or problems with feet can make a huge difference to the comfort and quality of life depression is another area where identification and treatment could improve wellbeing social and community support are also vital in enabling older people to enjoy as independent and contented a life as possible the emphasis in screening at this stage of life should be on improving quality of life and preserving function and independence rather than on providing “heroic” treatments to prevent mortality in table  screenings recommended in europe in elderly people are presented  table  recommended screenings in elderly in europe  condition under screening hypertension early heart failure hearing loss vision loss incontinence lack of physical activity foot problems review of medication comment physical assessment depression alcohol use mental assessment t falls undernutrition isolation social assessment conclusions screening programmes and practices vary widely across the countries of the european union eu this is inevitable given the differing structures and financing of health services and differing demographic features of the population there are however key objectives to strive for these include having one national body per country responsible for practice and policy scrupulous adherence to the longestablished screening criteria accurate population registers greater uniformity of access across different mare as of a given country and across different socioeconomic groups and sound research evidence on which to base practice the wide variation in practice in europe illustrates the complexity of screening some lessons however stand out key points of screening in the eu are  • antenatal screening programmes for down syndrome and spina bifida are performed only in a few countries and are mainly optional they are often only recommended to women at high risk • neonatal screening for phenylketonuria is systematically recommended in all countries belonging to the eu before may  except finland • breast cancer screening and cervical cancer screening programmes are recommended in some european countries • hiv screening is more common among the new member states and three candidate countries and covers specific vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and blood donors • tb screening is performed in a few european countries especially central and eastern european countries such as hungary romania and turkey  • not all the countries follow the basic criteria for screening a population register to allow recall and followup of patients is often missing a single national body for reviewing tests and practice is rare case study breast cancer screening cancer screenings at present the following screening tests meet requirements for organized screening programmes council recommendation of  december  on cancer screening ec oj l   • pap smear screening for cervical abnormalities starting at the latest by the age of  and definitely not before the age of  • mammography screening for breast cancer in women aged  in accordance with european guidelines on quality assurance in mammography • faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer in men and women age  decisions on implementation of cancer screening programmes must be made as part of a general prioritysetting exercise on the use of healthcare resources  other cancer screening tests are not yet recommended for euwide populationbased cancer screening although they already may be used in individual screening on demand such tests may provide individual benefits but at the same time may also lead to adverse effects for individuals eg unfounded anxiety and the public eg additional financial burden recommendations for such tests cannot be made until they have shown to have benefits such as reducing diseasespecific mortality or improving survival  potentially promising screening tests currently being evaluated in randomised controlled trials include • prostatespecific antigen psa testing for prostate cancer • mammography screening for women aged  for breast cancer • immunological faecal occult blood testing fobt for colorectal cancer • flexible colonoscopy for colorectal cancer once the effectiveness of a new screening test has been demonstrated evaluation of modified testing methods may be possible using intermediatesurrogate endpoints if the positive predictive value of such endpoints is sufficiently established some examples of screening methods which fall into this category are listed below • any novel alternative tests for faecal occult blood • liquidbased cervical cytology • testing for high risk human papilloma virus hpv infection • other novel methods for the preparation or interpretation of cervical specimens any screening test which has been demonstrated to be effective should be offered on a population basis only in organised screening programmes with quality assurance at all levels and full information about the benefits and risks    breast cancer screening breast cancer is currently the most frequent cancer and the most frequent cause of cancer induced deaths in women in europe demographic trends indicate a continuing increase in this substantial public health problem systematic early detection through screening effective diagnostic pathways and optimal treatment have the ability to substantially lower current breast cancer mortality rates and reduce the burden of this disease in the population in order that these benefits may be obtained high quality services are essential these may be achieved through the underlying basic principles of training specialisation volume levels multidisciplinary team working the use of set targets and performance indicators and audit ethically these principles should be regarded as applying equally to symptomatic diagnostic services and screening the primary aim of a breast screening programme is to reduce mortality from breast cancer through early detection unnecessary workup of lesions which show clearly benign features should be avoided in order to minimise anxiety and maintain a streamlined costeffective service women attending a symptomatic breast service have different needs and anxieties and therefore mixing of screening and symptomatic women in clinics should be avoided fundamental points and principles of the european guidelines for quality assurance of breast cancer screening programmes fundamental points and principles of the th edition of the european guidelines for quality assurance of breast cancer screening programmes are  • breast cancer screening is a complex multidisciplinary undertaking the objective of which is to reduce mortality and morbidity from the disease without adversely affecting the health status of participants it requires trained and experienced professionals using uptodate and specialised equipment • screening usually involves a healthy and asymptomatic population which requires adequate information presented in an appropriate and unbiased manner in order to allow a fully informed choice as to whether to attend information provided must be balanced honest adequate truthful evidencebased accessible respectful and tailored to individual needs where possible  • mammography remains the cornerstone of populationbased breast cancer screening due attention must be paid to the requisite quality required for its performance and interpretation in order to optimise benefits lower mortality and provide an adequate balance of sensitivity and specificity • physicotechnical quality control must ascertain that the equipment used performs at a constant high quality level providing sufficient diagnostic information to be able to detect breast cancer using as low a radiation dose as is reasonably achievable routine performance of basic test procedures and dose measurements is essential for assuring high quality mammography and comparison between centres • fullfield digital mammography can achieve high image quality and is likely to become established due to multiple advantages such as image manipulation and transmission data display and future technological developments extensive clinical comparative and logistical evaluations are underway  • the role of the radiographer is central to producing high quality mammograms which in turn are crucial for the early diagnosis of breast cancer correct positioning of the breast on the standard lateral oblique and craniocaudal views is necessary to allow maximum visualisation of the breast tissue reduce recalls for technical inadequacies and maximise the cancer detection rate • radiologists take prime responsibility for mammographic image quality and diagnostic interpretation they must understand the risks and benefits of breast cancer screening and the dangers of inadequately trained staff and suboptimal equipment for quality loop purposes the radiologist performing the screen reading should also be involved at assessment of screen detected abnormalities • all units carrying out screening diagnosis or assessment must work to agreed protocols forming part of a local quality assurance qa manual based on national or european documents containing accepted clinical standards and published values they should work within a specialist framework adhering to set performance indicators and targets variations of practices and healthcare environments throughout the member states must not interfere with the achievement of these • a robust and reliable system of accreditation is required for screening and symptomatic units so that women purchasers and planners of healthcare services can identify those breast clinics and units which are operating to a satisfactory standard any accreditation system should only recognise centres that employ sufficiently skilled and trained personnel • the provision of rapid diagnostic clinics where skilled multidisciplinary advice and investigation can be provided is advantageous for women with significant breast problems in order to avoid unnecessary delay in outline of management planning or to permit immediate discharge of women with normalbenign disease • population breast screening programmes should ideally be based within or closely associated with a specialised breast unit and share the services of trained expert personnel key performance indicators for monitoring in population based breast cancer screening programme key performance indicators to be monitored in any population based breast cancer screening programme are presented in table   table  summary table of key performance indicators to be monitored in any population based breast cancer screening

eržen theoretical background challenges and expectations facing contemporary health sectors healthcare systems around the globe face major challenges even if their nature and scale varies significantly between industrialised and developing countries these challenges include  • rising demand for health and social services due to an ageing population and higher income and educational levels in particular by  close to  of the union’s population will be older than  years old • the increasing expectations of citizens who want the best care available and at the same time to experience a reduction in inequalities in access to good health care • increasing mobility of patients and health professionals within a better functioning internal market • the need to reduce the socalled “disease burden” and to respond to emerging disease risks for example new communicable diseases like sars • the difficulties experienced by public authorities in matching investment in technology with investment in the complex organisational changes needed to exploit its potential • the need to limit occupational accidents and diseases to reinforce wellbeing at work and to address new forms of workrelated diseases • management of huge amounts of health information that need to be available securely accessibly and in a timely manner at the point of need processed efficiently for administrative purposes and • the need to provide the best possible health care under limited budgetary conditions facing theses challenges and looking at the possibilities it was found that one of the key tools that would be effective is the proper usage of information and communication technology in health sector like in other sectors this approach got a special name ehealth the role of ehealth ehealth describes the application of information and communications technologies across the whole range of functions that affect the health sector  ehealth tools or solutions include products systems and services that go beyond simply internetbased applications they include tools for both tools for health authorities and health professionals as well as tools for personalised health systems for patients and citizens it can improve access to healthcare and boost the quality and effectiveness of  the services offered examples include health information networks electronic health records telemedicine services personal wearable and portable communicable systems health portals and many other information and communication technologybased tools assisting prevention diagnosis treatment health monitoring and lifestyle management when combined with organisational changes and the development of new skills ehealth can help to deliver better care for less money within citizencentred health delivery systems ehealth systems and services that benefit the health sector ehealth can deliver significant improvements in access to care quality of care and the efficiency and productivity of the health sector ehealth can become key drivers for change and productivity gains in such areas as infrastructure and skills development internal business processes procurement procedures and supply chain management marketing and sales and functions of the extended business  the amount and complexity of healthrelated information and knowledge has increased to such a degree that a major component of any health organisation is information processing the health sector is clearly an information intensive sector which increasingly depends on information and communication technologies these technologies are supporting progress in medical research better management and diffusion of medical knowledge and a shift towards evidencebased medicine ehealth tools support the aggregation analysis and storage of clinical data in all its forms information tools provide access to the latest findings while communication tools enable collaboration among many different organisations and health professionals  empowering health consumers patients and healthy citizens both as patients and as healthy citizens people can benefit from better personal health education and disease prevention they need support in managing their own diseases risks – including workrelated diseases  and lifestyles a growing number of people are looking proactively for information on their medical conditions they want to be involved actively in decisions related to their own health rather than simply accepting the considerable discrepancy “asymmetry” in knowledge between themselves and health professionals ehealth services provide timely information tailored to individuals in need specialised online resources are available for health education safety and security at work and lifestyle management examples of personalised systems for monitoring and supporting patients include wearable or implantable communication systems for continuous monitoring patients’ heart conditions these systems can help shorten or completely avoid the stay of patients in hospitals while ensuring monitoring of their health status having access to comprehensive and secure electronic health records has been shown to improve quality of care and patient safety this will facilitate appropriate treatment of patients in providing health professionals with a better knowledge of the patient’s history and of previous interventions by other colleagues assisting health professionals the priority of medical professionals is to offer best quality care within available resources and above all according to the hippocratic oath doing no harm to the  patient primum non nocere however unfortunately medical errors still occur some of these might be avoided by making good use of ehealth systems that can provide vital information alerts and make best practices expert advice and results of clinical treatment more widely available ehealth tools and applications can provide fast and easy access to electronic health records at the point of need they can support diagnosis by noninvasive imagingbased systems they support surgeons in planning clinical interventions using digital patient specific data provide access to specialised resources for education and training and allow radiologists the possibility to access images anywhere thus the workplace is being redefined and extended digital data transfer enables more effective networking among clinical institutions and the creation of virtual network of centres of reference electronic health records also enable the extraction of information for research management public health or other related statistics of benefit to health professionals ehealth can benefit not only health professionals but all the staff employed in the health sector including nursing care and administrative staff for example in  this was  million persons in the european union of  member states or  of total workforce furthermore ehealth can contribute to achieving a safer working environment for health practitioners safer working environment is a very important issue in the european union health and social services have an accident rate which is  above the average by sector of accidents recorded most accidents relate to infectious diseases and dangers back injuries and shocks and hazards associated with electrical equipment or compressed gases  supporting health authorities and health managers health authorities and managers are responsible for the proper organisation and running of health systems  they do this against the background of increasing budgetary pressures and rising patient expectations ehealth systems can play a major part in meeting those pressures by making the health sector more productive and delivering better results with fewer resources unfortunately the currently available paperbased information aggregation and processing has major limitations a proper management of public health and clinical health can be undertaken only on the basis of comprehensive and highquality administrative and clinical data health authorities would benefit from better access to more comparable data on health issues there is a need for data and an underlying infrastructure that help health authorities to collaborate  for example on how to tackle communicable diseases integrated and comprehensive data can be provided in good time using ehealth tools such as electronic health records and support for care flow management automatic data extraction from electronic health systems that meet legal requirements on data protection and privacy could provide missing data that facilitates proper evaluation of much needed resources and eradicates the huge administrative burden of filling in separate forms for reimbursement  a clear example of a productivity gain to be achieved through ehealth systems and services these initiatives form a definite trend in the aim to modernise healthcare systems  increased networking exchange of experiences and data and benchmarking is also necessary at the national but also at the international level drivers for this  include the need for improvements in efficiency and the increased mobility of patients and health professionals under an emerging internal market in services the situation requires the integration of clinical organisational and economic information across health care facilities so as to facilitate virtual enterprises at the level of jurisdictions and beyond ehealth systems can empower managers by spreading best practices and helping to limit inefficient and inappropriate treatment this is the single most important step in releasing resources and ensuring broad access for everyone to quality care in addition ehealth opens new opportunities for people who live in remote areas with only limited healthcare services as well as marginalised groups such as persons with different degrees of disability whether minor or more severe ehealth is already proving in europe and in the developing world that it can provide a platform for telemedicine services such as teleconsultations second medical opinion telemonitoring and telecare either in the home or the hospital major challenges for wider implementation despite the availability and proven benefits ehealth systems and services are still not yet widely used in reallife medical or health situations in many places development is still at a pilot phase often financed through research grants the speed of organisational change is often slow and it can take many years to achieve full implementation a broad range of challenges remain to wider implementation   commitment and leadership of health authorities commitment and leadership of health authorities in particular related to financial and organisation issues are essential elements for the successful deployment of ehealth for ehealth to improve the way healthcare is provided it must be combined with organisational changes and the development of new skills in users ehealth was often traditionally perceived by health authorities as a low spending priority however it is now seen as a matter of substantial importance within public health policies  organisational and cultural approaches moreover organisational and cultural approaches relating to the way health care is delivered varies between countries and between organisations typically in the health area the introduction of new applications techniques and medicines has been slow yet – in organisational terms – the introduction of information and communication technologies has developed relatively fast hospitals too will be important players in the evolution towards ehealth and their involvement in adoption will be central to new forms of healthcare delivery   interoperability of ehealth systems interoperability should enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous systems this will allow secure and fast access to comparable public health data and to patient information located in different places over a wide variety of wired and wireless devices however this depends on standardisation of system components and services such as health information systems health messages electronic health record architecture and patient identifying services   user friendliness of ehealth systems and services a top priority for health providers in using an ehealth system is speed in getting the desired highquality results there is an absolute need for fast connection connectivity and high speed this highlights the importance of ensuring broadband connection for online health services and infrastructure for regional health information networks  confidentiality and security issues firstly the confidentiality and protection of patient data is governed by the general european union rules of data protection as well as by the requirements of eprivacy legislation regarding communications infrastructure the requirement for confidentiality makes health information systems security critical another important legal issue is liability in the event of problems such as technical malfunctions of the system network or provision of the service itself  that result in serious harm to a patient   issues relating to the mobility of patients another challenge is issues relating to the mobility of patients including the cross border circulation of goods and services among which ehealth services are of growing importance stronger cooperation among health providers across europe is needed to enable wider implementation  needs and interests of users the takeup of ehealth systems and services would take place more rapidly were the needs and interests of the user communities health professionals patients and citizens to be taken on board in general these should be better integrated into the development and promotion of ehealth  access for all to ehealth the equal access of all groups of society to health services is an important goal in the public health policy field  there is a risk that certain parts of society  such as lone parents of families isolated communities inner city communities individuals with literacy and numeracy challenges groups of immigrants homeless persons elderly persons and disabled persons – could remain excluded from the possibilities offered by ehealth including internetbased health services if special efforts are not made to counterbalance such trends on the other hand ehealth can offer considerable possibilities for the provision of health services to such individuals groups and communities  common understanding and concerted efforts by all stakeholders no single stakeholder can carry through implementation successfully on its own without the active cooperation of all the others each of the stakeholders health authorities professionals consumers industry has the power to veto an implementation if it is not perceived as beneficial only through concerted efforts by all stakeholders can we ensure a successful implementation where all partners benefit thereby creating a winwin situation concluding remarks ehealth offers important opportunities for improved access to better health systems to the citizens it can empower both patients and healthcare professionals it offers governments and tax payers a means  through substantial productivity gains  to cope  with increasing demand on healthcare services it can also help to reshape the future of health care delivery making it more citizencentred this ehealth area will provide a framework for exchanging best practices and experience in the country and between them it will allow common approaches to shared problems to be developed over time through ehealth a better access and better more efficient services as well as on the overall productivity of the healthcare sector is expected besides ehealth will become common place for health professionals patients and citizens an important prerequisite is that ehealth will be adequately resourced within healthcare budgets exercise task  carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module critically discuss the challenges and

potential in the healthcare service frameworks drago rudel malcolm fisk theoretical background the potential for new telecommunication technologies to introduce changes to healthcare because of the reducing cost of information and communication technologies ict they are increasingly available to a wide range of people including many with lower incomes and limited disposable wealth the configuration of such technologies means that they can be particularly useful to people with physical and sensory impairments or health related problems the technologies are media through which health and support services can be provided importantly as such technologies penetrate into ordinary homes the scope for such services to embrace everyone from the city to the remote village is enhanced technologies have along with white coats and ranks of beds been a defining feature of hospitals and clinics they have in many ways symbolised the power authority and expert knowledge that is accorded to doctors surgeons clinicians and other medical staff they have been instrumental in reenforcing hospital and clinical settings as the locus for medical care rather than our homes and communities the communications revolution however begins to change this since at least some of those technologies that were to be found in the hospital or clinic can now be offered within people’s own homes and together with the use where needed of healthcare auxiliary staff the technologies in question can facilitate healthcare treatment in ways that would in the past have required hospital admission underpinning this potential for change is the capacity of communications technologies to permit with great speed the transmission and exchange of visual images data and speech to date much of such transmission and exchange has been between doctors consultants and clinicians it generally took place within hospitals and clinics often excluding the patient now such transmission and exchange can begin to include the patient whether in a hospital or “at home” lengthy expensive and often repeated trips to hospitals and clinics might be obviated through the use of such technologies in assisting diagnoses and monitoring the effects of courses of treatment a  european commission report  has suggested that “the way healthcare is presently delivered has to be deeply reformed… the situation is becoming unsustainable and will only worsen in the future as chronic diseases and the demographic change place additional strains on healthcare systems around europe”  they call for a “… new healthcare delivery model based on preventative and personcentred health systems this new model can only be achieved through proper use of ict in combination with appropriate organisational changes and skills” nowadays there are a growing number of technological approaches to support predominantly people with long term conditions for instance vital sign monitoring technologies lifestyle monitoring reminder systems telephone based care management programmes kiosks for health and wellbeing and others telemedicine and telecare the practice of health and medical care at a distance using ict is known as “telemedicine” some speculation is taking place as to whether the term ‘telemedicine’ may be usurped by “telehealth” as more holistic approaches to patient care are taken the home environment is very important to health it can present a threat to health or it can be a context within which independent living and participation is facilitated the advantages for healthcare and medical services at home may be summarised as offering  the ability for the patient to remain in hisher preferred environment  the ability for the patient to benefit from the informal support provided by family members and others  a reduction in the risk of crossinfections that is often present in hospitals and  the possibility of obtaining better physiological measures notably cardiogram and blood pressure measures to assist in hisher treatment added to these is the fact that with patients being in what will usually be their preferred environment recovery can be quicker and the revenue costs of medical and nursing care reduced exploitation of the potential to support independent living needs however to be considered alongside a new means of providing healthcare and social support in the home that new means is called “telecare” telecare there already are support services that use established communications technologies in the homes of some people these use the telephone network and provide a means of getting help notably for people who are at risk of falling sudden illness fits or seizures the technologies in question are known by different names in different countries viz social alarms safety alarms or “personal response systems” prs the changing capabilities of prs are such that there is increasing recognition of their potential in relation to healthcare when it comes to the potential role of communications technologies in healthcare within people’s own homes a convergence between prs and telemedicine can be observed figure   together and when relating to their role in people’s own homes these communications technologies comprise telecare prs can be considered as a good example of telecare application personal response systems telemedicine telecare figure  telecare combines telemedicine and personal response systems personal response systems prs operate in all western european countries they are primarily used by vulnerable older people  the systems are designed to enable people to call for help even if they cannot reach the call unit  the carephone carephones have therefore become a rather common technical device among older people living at home personal response systems  enable people to stay at home  enable people to maintain their social and support networks  provide a means of obtaining help when needed and  provide reassurance to the user their relatives and carers unfortunately such systems and the services of which they are part are poorly developed in south eastern europe they may however have the potential to form the basis of new community based service frameworks that could bring both healthcare and practical support to people in their own homes this is because they  are less costly than support alternatives and  can be a useful way to complement or underpin other services longterm experiences in several developed european countries  show that a care network supported by a prs can significantly improve homebased care efficiency in terms of quality quantity and coordination  facilitating independent living and greater levels of participation can mean a reduction in the cost to state institutions of health care especially of those costs arising from the provision of institutional forms of accommodation nursing andor care homes prs could in other words reduce the necessity for additional capital and revenue investment in institutions such as hospitals and clinics that provide environments for the intensive provision of medical or nursing care how do personal response systems operate the typical prs comprises a carephone figure  which links to or replaces the telephone in a person’s home heshe may wear or carry a personal trigger pendant device that when pressed activates the carephone a staffed monitoring and response  centre is contacted figure  the callreceiving unit automatically identifies the caller and displays hisher personal data record on a computer screen a twoway speech path is opened the person in need is then able to tell the operator of the nature of hisher problem and the operator is then able to give advice or reassurance and depending on the circumstances contact relatives neighbours or the relevant emergency services  figure  an alarm unit with a neck worn triggering pendant tunstall group united kingdom is a basic element of a personal response system the unit is installed in the home of an elderly person together with an ordinary telephone the response centre can be a resource centre for homebased care in a community it is staffed  hours a day seven days a week the operator who responds to the calls must be experienced in communication and skilled to help in case of an emergency the operator’s main tasks are to  be there if and when help is needed  organise appropriate help by contacting informal or formal care providers and  coordinate care providers’ services a model of how community help providers are engaged is shown in figure  if a call for help comes from a client in a community where a response centre exists community  and help is needed at the caller’s home the operator in the prs centre asks informal or local formal carers to go and help where a response centre has its own mobile staff the operator may depending on the circumstances send one of them to help if a call comes from outside the community where the response centre is located eg from the community  an external care provider is engaged with help is coordinated from the response centre  figure  block diagram of a personal response system based on a public telephone network the system serves clients with carephones as well as others calling the centre using ordinary telephones a control centre operator processes a call and arranges suitable help community  prs centre mobile care provider care provider userclient community  community  userclient care provider community  figure  organisational model of care providing in different areas legend prs  personal response system  telecare in the future the majority of prss currently operating around the world are of the first and the second generation they are limited by the need for the user to take some action normally pushing a button in order to call for assistance only by this means can contact with a response centre be established a common phenomenon however is one where the user is unwilling to take such action for a complex range of reasons  these include the user thinking that the condition such as pain breathlessness dizziness or bleeding will cease or the user being unwilling to disturb others whether staff at the response centre or someone who would as a consequence of the call visit their home new systems are however being developed which can automatically monitor an older person’s wellbeing  this means that for many situations the response centre can be alerted automatically if problems arise such as the older person falling or becoming inactive such systems in incorporating greater interactivity are being described as ‘second generation’ insofar as they increasingly permit the provision of care at home the services associated with them can be embraced by the broader term “telecare” the use of different sensor devices alongside carephones now means however that such they can offer what has been described as a “dynamic method of monitoring and detecting medical social and environmental problems”  figure  a general model of a telecare system through which carers could respond to the users wellbeing needs  but sensors alone are not enough if the needs of growing numbers of frail older people are to be met the systems within which they operate must be able to both respond to certain conditions or circumstances the user falling low dwelling temperature etc and to recognise and remember the user’s normal pattern of living any significant deviation from that normal pattern can then be recognised and the response centre can contact the user to establish if there is a problem such intelligent systems figure  mean speedier interventions in the event of medical or other emergencies a reduction in care costs and significant psychosocial benefits for users case study the slovene experience  the “lifeline” telecare service for older people slovenia and the older population slovenia as a new independent state with  million inhabitants has a moderate living standard the population is getting older about   are aged  years and over projections show that there will be another  people joining them within the next  years the increasing number of older people presents a challenge to the system of social and health care only  of older people live in care homes or other institutions but a disproportionately high amount of money is spent for their social and medical care institutions are owned by the government this means that there are considerable costs to the government as residents cover only  of them government policy however tends to restrict spending on social and medical benefits and reduced investment in institutional care is planned as a consequence investment in new care homes is insufficient to cover growing needs this is resulting in long waiting lists and over  years waiting time government plans to  are to provide only  new beds in homes while over  are currently required the situation suggests that the predominant model of institutional care currently in place should be complemented by alternative solutions such as homebased care however while there is some effort being given to keeping people in their own home by providing a range of domiciliary services the level of home based care differs from region to region the services in question are organised and coordinated by local social welfare and medical staff personal response systems in slovenia a telecare system called lifeline network already exists in slovenia  there are currently two response centres based at and administered by homes for older people the first centre was established in ljubljana in  lifeline equipment manufactured in united kingdom was installed clients were recruited randomly and equipped with lifeline carephones currently the system is used by  older and disabled persons on a revolving system the response centre recruits formal or informal carers over a period of  years users have made  calls using the lifeline carephones of those calls  was emergency calls for a medical assistance in the same period almost the same number of calls to the centre was made by people  using ordinary telephones all carephone users reported positive psychological effects this having been confirmed in an evaluation  all response centre clients pay a monthly monitoring fee carephones can be leased from the response centres for what the clients are charged additionally service charges vary the amount charged depends on the financial resources of the older person and the particular range of services heshe receives services charges vary from nothing to over  euros a month a carephone purchased from a local distributor costs up to  euros two health insurance companies offer carephones through their health insurance plans lifeline programme – personal response system implementation based on the ljubljana lifeline network experience a national plan for the dissemination of the system was prepared a part of it was adopted also in the government programmes on social care of older people in slovenia  a concept of a network consisting of several regional response centres was accepted to meet needs of  potential users the reasons for a decentralised system were  the traditional regional distribution of slovenia’s population  the national preference for decentralised systems  organisational reasons that suggest that help organised and coordinated very locally improved coordination among service providers and  positive experiences of similar provision in other countries some regions have already prepared their local programmes in collaboration with their initiative group and local initiative boards the most important issues studied in the programmes have been the  potential management and administration of a response centre  needs for domiciliary care in the region  availability of carer services in the region and  attitude of local politicians and professionals towards the initiative it is believed that the implementation of the programme would have manifold positive effects in the communities these include  frail people living alone in their own homes being provided with sufficient support to stay there instead of being institutionalised  extended and improved exchange of information between those being cared and those who care in a region  better coordination of care provided by professional workers andor volunteers and  more economical spending of government funds to achieve agreed social welfare and medical standards at the current stage support for the introduction of a lifeline programme at a national level is mostly moral and verbal most politicians being responsible for advances in health and social care sectors agree that the proposed programme has substantial merits and is therefore important for slovenia nevertheless the programme has not as yet been systematically supported however some endusers  would accept the programme if it is paid for by social and health insurance two health insurance agencies have included the service into their optional insurance schemes obstacles to a dissemination process technology transfer related problems the lifeline community response system is a new technology in slovene society having a different system of social welfare and health care from that in united kingdom there has been a problem of technology transfer consequently lifeline as a technical innovation has not yet fully been accepted  lack of cooperation successful implementation of the lifeline system demands cooperation communication and interaction between politicians professional bodies and individuals waiting for the other party to make the first move has characterised behaviour in many regions there has been furthermore a historical legacy of non cooperation between professionals additionally the reorganisation of municipalities into tiny local communities has almost precluded regional initiatives at all levels however there has been moral support for the implementation of the system lack of funds although an initial capital investment in any new care network is required the resulting service would be expected to enable considerable savings on national residential care costs to introduce services slovenia would need a system that would enable potential providers to develop their services and potential user to get services through different insurance systems or through a welfare system the law on compulsory longterm care assurance is a hope for all interested but it has been preparation since  without a promise to be ready in few years so providers of telecare and potential users in slovenia have to use other means and take other ways the government is willing to cover  of the response centre infrastructure costs some local communities subsidize telecare services for their locals and give some funds for purchasing of carephones workforce costs and the response centre facilities conclusion the question now is not whether the telecare system will be implemented in slovenia nationally but rather how long will it take to disseminate the programme throughout the country exercises task  demonstration of telecare system operation  organize demonstration a telecare centre could be outside your country   demonstrate how system operates making calls to a telecare

complementary and alternative medicine some publichealth views marjan premik lijana zaletelkragelj theoretical background public health is concerned with the reciprocal influences between the state of health of the inhabitants and the social and environmental factors that impact on it it is based on a number of scientific disciplines and takes into account the findings of natural social political organisational and other sciences public health also deals with various phenomena associated with the implementation of medicine speaking of medicine we are usually thinking of scientific medicine which is founded on natural and biomedical science but along this kind of medicine there exist also known frequently also as “alternative medicine” there exist several public health aspects of this kind of medicine and only few of them could be discussed in such an introductory teaching module the focus of this module will be on introductory issues of this kind of medicine like definitions and brief description epidemiology and some aspects of regulation and it will not deal with its efficacy basic definitions and explanation of terms before starting to discuss the phenomenon of “the other medicine” it is necessary first of all to clarify terminological issues concerning it medicine before trying to explain the meaning of terms “alternative medicine” “complementary medicine” or related terms we need first to define what the term “medicine” means  medicine as a discipline among others following definitions and explanations could be found • according to merriamwebster online dictionary medicine is the science and art dealing with the maintenance of health and the prevention alleviation or cure of disease  • in thefreedictionary online dictionary two definitions could be found being medicine is the art and science of preventing diagnosing treating and managing illness  and the diagnosis and treatment of disease and the maintenance of health  but also following more specific definitions and explanations could be found • according to merriamwebster online dictionary medicine means also the branch of medicine concerned with the nonsurgical treatment of disease  • according tothefreedictionary online dictionary medicine means also the treatment of disease by nonsurgical means   since this term is used in rather different context it should be supplemented with an adjective designating more specifically what medicine discipline we are talking about eg conventional  medicine as meanagent used for treating diseased people among others following definitions and explanations could be found • in merriamwebster online dictionary three definitions could be found being medicine is a substance or preparation used in treating disease or something that affects wellbeing  a substance as a drug or potion used to treat something other than disease  and an object held in traditional american indian belief to give control over natural or magical forces also magical power or a magical rite  • according tothefreedictionary online dictionary medicine is any drug or remedy  conventional versus unconventional medicine when we in europe north america and australia speak of medicine as a discipline we are usually thinking of scientific medicine which is founded on natural and biomedical science which is also known as “conventional medicine”  conventional medicine the term “conventional” according to merriamwebster online dictionary means something what is formed by agreement  in this context among others following definitions and explanations of conventional medicine could be found • according tothefreedictionary online dictionary conventional medicine is the model of currently established western medicine this paradigm was designated as conventional because of its prevalence what is considered conventional is always in flux  • according to medicinenet online dictionary conventional medicine is medicine as practiced by holders of md medical doctor or do doctor of osteopathy degrees and by their allied health professionals such as physical therapists psychologists and registered nurses other terms for conventional medicine include allopathy and allopathic medicine synonyms are western medicine mainstream medicine orthodox medicine and regular medicine and biomedicine  the same definition is adopted by the us national institutes of health national centre for complementary and alternative medicine nccam  the other term for conventional medicine is among others allopathic medicine according to merriamwebster online dictionary “allopathic” means relating to or being a system of medicine that aims to combat disease by using remedies as drugs or surgery which produce effects that are different from or incompatible with those of the disease being treated  the term “allopathy” was coined in  by cfs hahnemann to designate the usual practice of medicine allopathy as opposed to homeopathy the system of therapy that he founded based on the concept that disease can be treated with drugs in minute doses thought capable of producing the same symptoms in healthy people as the disease itself  following explanations of what allopathic medicine is could be found  • according to medicinenet online dictionary allopathic medicine is the system of medical practice which treats disease by the use of remedies which produce effects different from those produced by the disease under treatment mds practice allopathic medicine  • according tothefreedictionary online dictionary allopathic medicine is method of medical treatment in which drugs are administered to counter symptoms of the disease  conventional medicine is sometimes denoted also as “standard medicine” or “official medicine” the last term could be misleading since in different countries of the world some methods classified in western countries as “unconventional” are officially recognized as well  unconventional medicine along conventional medicine there exist also the “other medicine”  the “unconventional medicine” in western countries frequently denoted also as “alternative medicine” the word “alter” in latin means “other” accordingly the word “alternative medicine” means a “different medicine” other terms like “complementary medicine” or “traditional medicine” are used basic unconventional medicine terminology  alternative medicine • according to merriamwebster online dictionary alternative medicine is any of various systems of healing or treating disease as chiropractic homeopathy or faith healing not included in the traditional medical curricula taught in the united states and britain  • in thefreedictionary online dictionary two definitions could be found being alternative medicine are therapeutic practices not considered integral to conventional medicine used instead of conventional therapies and alternative medicine is a variety of therapeutic or preventive health care practices such as homeopathy naturopathy and herbal medicine that are not typically taught or practiced in traditional medical communities and offer treatments that differ from standard medical practice  • according to medicinenet online dictionary alternative medicine is healing arts not taught in traditional western medical schools that promote options to conventional medicine that is taught in these schools an example of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery radiation or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a western physician complementary medicine is different from alternative medicine whereas complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine  • according to mayo clinic alternative medicine is medicine which is generally thought of as being used instead of conventional methods for example this might mean seeing a homeopath or naturopath instead of regular doctor   complementary medicine  • according to merriamwebster online dictionary complementary medicine is any of the practices as acupuncture of alternative medicine accepted and utilized by mainstream medical practitioners  • in thefreedictionary online dictionary two definitions could be found first of them being complementary medicine are therapeutic practices not considered integral to conventional medicine used in conjunction with conventional therapies often used interchangeably with the term “alternative medicine” encompasses the wide array of therapies not generally offered by mds and not usually covered by health insurance complementary is considered a more accurate term because in practice patients do not replace allopathic treatment but instead supplement it with complementary medicine  the second definition states that complementary medicine is a method of health care that combines the therapies and philosophies of conventional medicine with those of alternative medicines such as acupuncture herbal medicine and biofeedback  • according to medicinenet online dictionary complementary medicine a group of diagnostic and therapeutic disciplines that are used together with conventional medicine an example of a complementary therapy is using aromatherapy to help lessen a patients discomfort following surgery  • complementary medicine is usually not taught or used in western medical schools or hospitals complementary medicine includes a large number of practices and systems of health care that for a variety of cultural social economic or scientific reasons have not been adopted by mainstream western medicine • complementary medicine is different from alternative medicine whereas complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine an example of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery radiation or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a physician • according to mayo clinic complementary medicine is medicine which is thought of as treatments used in addition to the conventional therapies your doctor may prescribe such as using tai chi or massage in addition to prescription medicine for anxiety  • according to zollman and vickers complementary medicine refers to a group of therapeutic and diagnostic disciplines that exist largely outside the institutions where conventional health care is taught and provided in the s and s these disciplines were mainly provided as an alternative to conventional health care and hence became known collectively as “alternative medicine” the name “complementary medicine” developed as the two systems began to be used alongside to “complement” each other over the years “complementary” has changed from describing this relation between unconventional healthcare disciplines and conventional care to defining the group of disciplines itself   traditional medicine tm • according to who definition adopted in  traditional medicine is “the sum total of the knowledge skills and practices based on the theories beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures whether explicable or not used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention diagnosis  improvement or treatment of physical and mental illnesses the terms complementaryalternativenonconventional medicine are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries”  • according to who definition adopted in  traditional medicine refers to health practices approaches knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant animal and mineral based medicines spiritual therapies manual techniques and exercises applied singularly or in combination to treat diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain wellbeing  • there are many tm systems including traditional chinese medicine indian ayurveda and arabic unani medicine a variety of indigenous tm systems have also been developed throughout history by asian african arabic native american oceanic central and south american and other cultures influenced by factors such as history personal attitudes and philosophy their practice may vary greatly from country to country and from region to region their theory and application often differ significantly from those of allopathic medicine  • according to the who traditional medicine strategy  document “traditional medicine” term is used when referring to a broad set of health care practices used in africa latin america southeast asia andor the western pacific   integrated or integrative medicine • according to thefreedictionary online dictionary integrative medicine is holistic system of medicine that combines the best treatments and approaches from various disciplines including traditional medicine natural healing phytotherapy and eastern modalities so that treatments complement one another resulting in safer and effective care  • according to mayo clinic conventional doctors are learning more about complementary and alternative medicine because they recognize that more than half of people try some kind of alternative treatment many health care institutions have begun integrating therapies that arent part of mainstream medicine into their treatment programs a number of medical schools now include education on untraditional techniques in their curriculum as complementary and alternative therapies prove effective theyre being combined more often with conventional care this is known as integrative medicine  • according to osher center for integrative medicine of school of medicine university of san francisco california integrative medicine is a new term that emphasizes the combination of both conventional and alternative approaches to address the biological psychological social and spiritual aspects of health and illness it emphasizes respect for the human capacity for healing the importance of the relationship between the practitioner and the patient a collaborative approach to patient care among practitioners and the practice of conventional complementary and alternative health care that is evidencebased  the term “integrated medicine is used in the uk while in the us the term “integrative medicine” is used  complementary and alternative medicine cam  in some parts of the world being europe north america and australia the terms “complementary” and “alternative” are used to refer to health care practices that are not part of a country’s own tradition or not integrated into its dominant health care system the distinction between these two terms has been already described to avoid using one or another term recently the comprehensive term being “complementary and alternative medicine” or in short cam was adopted it is a widely used term the definition of cam has been developed at a  conference of the united states office for alternative medicine of the national institutes of health now nccam and subsequently adopted by the cochrane collaboration the ministerial advisory committee on complementary and alternative medicine and who  there exist several different but very similar definitions • as cited by roberti di sarsina and zollman and vickers  the definition according to nccam which was later adopted by cochrane collaboration cam is a “broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems modalities and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period cam includes all such practices and ideas self defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and wellbeing boundaries within cam and between the cam domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed” • the who as cited by roberti di sarsina  defines cam slightly different  “cam refers to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of a country’s own tradition and not integrated into the dominant health care system other terms sometimes used to describe these health care practices include ‘‘natural medicine’’ ‘‘nonconventional medicine’’ and ‘‘holistic medicine” • according to thefreedictionary online dictionary cam is a “large and diverse set of systems of diagnosis treatment and prevention based on philosophies and techniques other than those used in conventional western medicine such practices may be described as alternative existing as a body separate from and as a replacement for conventional western medicine or complementary used in addition to conventional western practice cam is characterized by its focus on the whole person as a unique individual on the energy of the body and its influence on health and disease on the healing power of nature and the mobilization of the bodys own resources to heal itself and on the treatment of the underlying causes not symptoms of disease many of the techniques used are controversial and have not been validated by controlled studies”  • also another definitions could be found according to ernst cam is defined as “diagnosis treatment andor prevention which complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks of medicine”   tmcam when discussing about health care practices that are not part of a country’s own tradition or not integrated into its dominant health care system referring in a  general sense to all of different regions of the world the comprehensive tmcam term should be used  methods and systems of complementary and alternative medicine like

strategies that are thought to promote health such as relaxation hypnosis visual imagery meditation yoga biofeedback tai chi qi gong cognitivebehavioural therapies group support autogenic training and spirituality in traditional chinese medicine the use of heat from burning the herb moxa on or near the skin at an acupuncture point intended to stimulate the flow of qi and restore health a whole medical system rooted in health care approaches that were popular in europe especially in germany in the th century but it also includes therapies both ancient and modern from other traditions it aims to support the bodys ability to heal itself through the use of dietary and lifestyle changes together with cam therapies such as herbs massage and joint manipulation the emphasis is on supporting health rather than combating disease use of nutritional methods to address and prevent disease uses diets and nutritional supplements often used to address allergies and chronic digestive problems the difference between nutritional medicine and dietetics is that nutritional therapists work independently in accordance with naturopathic principles and focus on disorders which they believe can be attributed to nutritional deficiency food intolerance or toxic overload they believe these three factors are involved in a wide range of health problems dieticians usually work under medical supervision using diets to encourage healthy eating and tackle a narrower range of diseases nutritional therapists often use exclusion diets and herbal remedies to tackle patients problems  table

and uk complementary and alternative medicine specialist library  also many of them are described in a series of papers published in british medical journal in   categorization of complementary and alternative medicine methodssystems tmcam methods are very heterogeneous but could be classified in some major areas two categorizations are presented nccam us categorization in the us national center for complementary and alternative medicine nccam of the national institutes of health uses following classification   whole medical systems  tmcam systems are complete sets of theories and practices a system isnt just a single practice or remedy such as massage but many different practices that all centre on a philosophy or lifestyle such as the power of nature or the presence of energy in your body many healing systems developed long before the conventional western medicine examples of complementary and alternative medicine treatmenthealing systems are ayurveda homeopathy naturopathy and ancient medicines traditional chinese medicine traditional asian medicine traditional pacific islander medicine traditional american indian and traditional tibetan practices  mindbody medicine  mindbody techniques strengthen the communication between mind and body it is believed that these two systems must be in harmony for you to stay healthy examples of mindbody medicine techniques are meditation yoga biofeedback hypnosis and relaxation therapies as well as art therapies such as poetry music and dance  biologically based practices  these practices use substances found in nature such as herbs foods and vitamins examples of biologically based practices are herbal medicine and dietnutritional therapies  manipulative and body based practices  these methods use human touch to move or manipulate a specific part of your body examples of manipulative and body based practices are chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation massage and acupressure  energy medicine  energy medicine practices use energy fields unblocking or rebalancing energy force is the goal of these therapies examples of energy therapies are acupuncture reiki qi gong therapeutic touch magnet therapy polarity therapy and light therapy the distinctions between therapies arent clearcut some techniques may fit in more than one category for example acupressure could fit either in the category of manipulation and touch or in the category of energy therapies also there exist  tmcam treatmenthealing systems which use techniques from more than one category house of lords uk categorization in the uk the house of lords select committee on science and technology report on complementary and alternative medicine  took a different line by categorising specific approaches and therapies into  groups  professionally organised alternative therapies this group includes what may be called the principal disciplines osteopathy chiropractic acupuncture herbal medicine and homeopathy two of them osteopathy and chiropractic were in  already regulated in their professional activity and education in uk by acts of parliament these methods are seen as the principal methods by most of the cam world  complementary therapies this group includes therapies which are most often used to complement conventional medicine and do not include diagnostic skills alexander technique aromatherapy bach and other flower remedies body work therapies including massage counselling stress therapy hypnotherapy meditation reflexology shiatsu healing maharishi ayurvedic medicine nutritional medicine and yoga  alternative disciplines this group includes those other disciplines which purport to offer diagnostic information as well as treatment and which in general favour a philosophical approach and are indifferent to the scientific principles of conventional medicine and through which various and disparate frameworks of disease causation and its management are proposed these therapies can be split into two subgroups • longestablished and traditional systems of healthcare anthroposophical medicine ayurvedic medicine chinese herbal medicine eastern medicine naturopathy and traditional chinese medicine and • other alternative disciplines which lack any credible evidence base crystal therapy dowsing iridology kinesiology and radionics health philosophy differences between conventional and unconventional medicine from the public health perspective we would like to emphasize the philosophical and conceptual differences between conventional medicine and tmcam there exist two fundamentally different modern models of health the biomedical and the bioecopsychosocial models the knowledge on of these two models is important for understanding differences between conventional medicine and tccam as well as for understanding the processes related to the supply demand and evaluation of conventional and unconventional medicine health services  biomedicine is a dominant paradigm in the modern conventional medicine health care systems figure   biomedical model of health conventional medicine complementary and alternative medicine biobioecoecopsychopsychosocial model of health figure  health philosophy differences between conventional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine it is based on natural sciencesscientific medical theory and practice focused on the internal operation of the body biomedicine verifies its theories which are accepted as fact by using scientifically methods accepted facts are not suspicions or deductions but discoveries revealed with the assistance of specific universally accepted strict procedures focused on the integral functioning of the body including mental processes biomedical certainty is founded on the supposition that people can be understood and reconstructed in all their physical mental and social integrity through the collection of facts about various parts of their body biomedical monitoring has in the last decades of this century been exposed to serious criticism both by medical and nonmedical circles due to some of its deficiencies  although critics of the existing biomedical paradigm proceed from divergent standpoints and different levels of analyses which consequently has different implications they share the conclusion that what are needed are broader and stricter scientific research methods the promotion of the significance of public health the strengthening of spiritual values the recognition of social stratification and differences in communities and consideration of the personal beliefs of patients critics offer a series of different social scientific outlooks and theories which cast doubt on whether biomedicine is the “one and only” medical science and demand a scientific evaluation of the meaning of quality and freedom the biomedical model is also criticised because of the monopoly of doctors on “medical knowledge” and because of the predominantly unacceptable standpoint regarding everything which could be denoted as a different view of an illness a health problem or health the common denominator of all the more important critics is the awareness that healthcare and treatment can end using biomedical technology  the biomedical model of understanding illness and health problems is placed side by side with the bioecopsychosocial model of understanding diseases and health the bioecopsychosocial model does not agree with universality neutrality and the allround usefulness of the biomedical model and it questions such a principle  the bioecopsychosocial model is based on searching for the cause for disease outside the body presupposing that disease is a product of life style and specific social circumstances it is a synthesis of various conceptualizations it allows us to develop more comprehensive and efficient approach also to health promotion and disease prevention and it is thus of crucial importance also for public health cam and international integrationsorganizations several international integrationsorganizations are dealing with the problem of dialogue between conventional medicine and cam as well as different aspects of cam eg quality effectiveness and safety of cam procedures education of cam practitioners etc for european region response on cam phenomenon of following international integrationsorganizations is important  who made a number of policy recommendations and documents concerning tmcam among them • in  the general guidelines for methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicine  were published • in the legal status of traditional medicine and complementary alternative medicine a worldwide review  was published • in  the traditional medicines strategy   was published • in  the guidelines on developing consumer information on proper use of traditional complementary and alternative medicine  were published • in  the global atlas of traditional complementary and alternative medicine  was published the who is prepared to help evaluate and study the safety and effectiveness of the tmcam methods used by research to supplement knowledge in traditional and modern health practitioners an approach to health in a way which in individual environments is passed on from generation to generation as well as to notify the public regarding the confirmed discoveries associated with the use of unconventional methods for this purpose the who has at the beginning of this millennium already founded several collaboration centres for traditional medicine among developed countries which have such centres are for example belgium italy japan and the us   in european union a growing demand on cam among the european citizens also dictated some steps dealing with cam sphere but the process is much slower than at the global level eg who among important steps are • in  cost european cooperation in the field of scientific and technical research action b project unconventional medicine was launched the main objective of this project was to foster international collaboration in research into the therapeutic significance of cam its costbenefit ratio and its sociocultural importance as a basis for evaluation of its possible usefulness or risks in the public health in this project  parties participated belgium denmark finland germany hungary italy netherlands norway slovenia spain sweden switzerland and uk   • in   european parliament has promulgated on  a resolution a on the status of nonconventional medicine  • in  the final report on cost action b project unconventional medicine  eur  en was published  • in  the supplement to this final report was published  • in  the directive ec of the european parliament and of the council on the community code relating to medicinal products for human use official journal of the european communities l  was adopted  this directive among other medicinal products regulates also homeopathic medicinal products from the public health point of view seems clear that a tendency towards the integration of different cam therapeutic procedures in health care systems is inevitable but there are too many different points of view in eu to adopt common legal base   council of europe •  – resolution no  entitled “a european approach to nonconventional medicines”  was promulgated in it the assembly of the council stated that it believes that the best guarantee for patients lies in a properly trained profession which is aware of its limitations has a system of ethics and selfregulation and is also subject to outside control incorporation of tmcam into national health care systems who has defined three types of health system to describe the degree to which tmcam is an officially recognized element of health care being integrative inclusive and tolerant systems figure   integrative health care system relation to cam inclusive tolerant figure  health care systems classification according to the incorporation of tmcam  within the system legend tmtraditional medicine camcomplementary and alternative medicine   integrative health care systems in an integrative system tmcam is officially recognized and incorporated into all areas of health care provision this means that tmcam is included in the relevant country’s national drug policy providers and products are registered and regulated tmcam therapies are available at hospitals and clinics both public and private treatment with tmcam is reimbursed under health insurance relevant research is undertaken and education in tmcam is available  in  only china the democratic people’s republic of korea the republic of korea and viet nam were considered to have attained an integrative system   inclusive health care systems an inclusive system recognizes tmcam but has not yet fully integrated it into all aspects of health care health care delivery education and training or regulation tmcam might not be available at all health care levels health insurance might not cover treatment with tmcam official education in tmcam might not be available at university level and regulation of tmcam providers and products might be lacking or only partial work on policy regulation practice health insurance coverage research and education are in process or will be prepared  countries with an inclusive system in  included developing countries equatorial guinea nigeria mali which had a national tmcam policy but little or no regulation of tmcam products and developed countries canada the usa the uk germany norway which in  did not offer significant universitylevel education in tmcam but which were making efforts to ensure the quality and safety of tmcam   tolerant health care systems in countries with a tolerant system the national health care system is based entirely on allopathic medicine but some tmcam practices are tolerated by law  here authors need to stress that beside listed types of systems also exist or existed in the near past the intolerant systems in these systems cam methods were legally not allowed slovenia could be classified in this group until  users of cam how many people use cam and which methods only partial answer to this question could be attained since in different countries cam methods are differently treated and different methods are included under the term cam  for the us the most comprehensive and recent data on use of cam were presented in  by experts from national center for health statistics centres for disease control and prevention and nccam  they came from the  national health interview survey an annual crosssectional study in  adults aged  years or older responded it included detailed questions on cam  the results of this survey showed that  of adults used some form of cam therapy excluding megavitamin therapy and prayer during the past  months the  most commonly used cam therapies excluding use of prayer natural products  deep breathing exercises  meditation  chiropractic care  yoga  massage  and dietbased therapies  if megavitamin therapy and prayer are included according to this survey  of adults used some form of cam therapy during the past  months  the uk science and technology sixth report  is summarizing results of two surveys in the uk and england which give us a rough impression about how many people use cam methods in developed countries • in a telephone survey of  randomly selected uk adults conducted for the bbc in   of respondents declared that they used any of cam methods in past  months herbal medicine  aromatherapy  homeopathy  acupunctureacupressure  massage  reflexology  osteopathy  and chiropractic  some individuals used more than one therapy • in a postal survey of  randomly selected adults response rate of  conducted about the same time in england  of respondents had visited a cam practitioner in the preceding  months osteopathy  chiropractic  aromatherapy  a reflexology  and acupuncture  some individuals used more than one therapy and overall  of respondents had either visited a cam therapist or had purchased an overthecounter remedy  for some other countries in europe following data could be found • in  fisher and ward in their review article reported that percentages of public reporting use of complementary medicine any form of it was  belgium  denmark  france  germany  netherlands  sweden  united kingdom  • in  nilsson and coworkers reported that in  monica survey in sweden  of  respondents reported that they had taken a cam product vitamins minerals or biological cam remedy in the preceding  weeks vitaminsminerals only had been taken by  and other cam remedies dominated by fish oil ginseng and q with or without vitaminsminerals by   • in  biocca et al reported that in italy in general the percentage of people who turned to at least one nonconventional medicine therapy in the period  was  from  in southern italy to  in northeastern italy  • in  rössler and coworkers reported results of their longitudinal community zurich study in switzerland  they showed that cam use in the last  months was reported by  of the participants in  and by  in  why people use cam and who are the users people who use cam methods usually have chronic conditions for which conventional medicine has not provided a satisfactory solution either because it is  insufficiently effective or because it causes adverse effects on general they have already consulted a conventional healthcare practitioner for the problem and many continue to use the two systems concurrently  in us according to the  national health interview survey  cam was most often used to treat back pain or back problems  head or chest colds  neck pain or neck problems  joint pain or stiffness  arthritis gout lupus or fibromyalgia  and anxiety or depression  the same survey showed that cam is more frequently used by females females  males  middleaged participants  years   years   years   years   years   years   years or more  and participants with highest education less than high school  high school graduateged recipient  some collegeno degree  associate of arts degree  bachelor of arts or science degree  masters doctorate professional degree   the uk science and technology sixth report  is also summarizing results about the main reasons for accessing cam medicines or therapies of the bbc survey of cam use in the united kingdom in  being helps or relieves injurycondition  just like it  find it relaxing  good healthwellbeing generally  preventative measure  do not believe conventional medicine works  doctors recommendationsreferral  to find out about other ways of lifenew things  way of lifepart of lifestyle  cannot get treatment on nhsunder conventional medicine  zollman and vickers in their series of “abc of complementary medicine” reported that about  of those who consulted complementary practitioners were female what was a similar proportion to users of conventional healthcare  they also reported that highest users were those aged  on the contrary users of conventional healthcare services tended to be the very old and the very young also users of complementary medicine tended to be in higher socioeconomic groups and had higher levels of education than users of conventional care  for sweden in  nilsson and coworkers reported that among  monica survey in sweden use of cam remedies was more frequent in women than in men and more frequent in people with high than with low level of education the prevalence was unrelated to a history of severe cardiovascular disease or diabetes but significantly more common in subjects with poor selfperceived health particularly so in women in all environments people use different cam methods for the preventive purposes cam practitioners the data on structure of cam practitioners are scarce what is the reflection of situation of cam nevertheless there exist some of them we have found some data on cam practitioners in uk • zollman and vickers in their series of “abc of complementary medicine” report that the number and profile of complementary practitioners is changing  rapidly  in  about  registered practitioners were working in the uk and by  this figure had increased to about   • few years later the uk science and technology sixth report  reports the results of the centre for complementary health studies at exeter university which was commissioned by the department of health to conduct a study of the professional organisation of cam bodies in the uk the results of this study suggested that there in  there were approximately  cam practitioners in the uk and that there were approximately  statutory registered health professionals who practise some form of cam some perspectives on and attitudes towards cam it is typical for all sociocultural groups of people to form standpoints relations convictions behaviour and standards for conventional as well as cam two groups are interesting from the public health point of view being medical doctors and lay people as users of conventional medicine and cam  medical doctors medical doctors as dominant representative and implementators of conventional medicine gain most of their discoveries from the biomedical field of science and have their relations formally defined in the codes of practice of their medical organisations thus it is not surprising that their attitude towards alternative medicine is in many countries negative their attitude towards cam is a reflection of attitude of the country towards cam and their education for uk for example zollman and vickers reported in  that surveys of doctors attitudes to complementary medicine showed at that time that physicians in uk believed cam is moderately effective but low response rates make some studies unreliable although hospital doctors and older general practitioners tended to be more sceptical than younger doctors and medical students most respondents believed that some of the more established forms were of benefit and should be available on the national health system younger doctors and medical students were also more likely to perceive their knowledge of complementary medicine as inadequate and wanted be more educated in the subject  qualitative research showed also that many doctors wanted to be supportive of patients choices and would welcome further information although they generally regard cam therapies as scientifically unproved  their main concerns were that the patients  • may see unqualified complementary practitioners • may risk missed or delayed diagnosis • may stop or refuse effective conventional treatment • may waste money on ineffective treatments • may experience dangerous adverse effects from treatment • the mechanisms of some complementary treatments are so implausible that they cannot possibly work  lay people in contrast many lay people express a favourable opinion on alternative methods of treatment and a lot of them actually make use of them we have already discussed the possible reasons  contemporary user of health  care services wants to be treated in more holistic way and wants to be more actively involved in the process this is well known more than a decade for example zollman and vickers in their series of “abc of complementary medicine” reported that according to the surveys of users of complementary medicine in uk about  of them were satisfied with the treatment they received  this was not always dependent on an improvement in their presenting complaint for example in one uk survey of cancer patients changes attributed to cam included being emotionally stronger less anxious and more hopeful about the future even if the cancer remained unchanged  furthermore a community health council survey found that over two thirds of cam users returned for further courses of treatment and that over  thought that they might use complementary medicine in the future  this indicated high level of satisfaction of cam users zollman and vickers claim that the specific effects of particular therapies obviously account for a proportion of patient satisfaction but surveys and qualitative research show that many patients also value some of the general attributes of cam  they discuss in details several aspects of satisfaction of users of cam with cam methods and practitioners being  • amount of time available for consultation and continuity • attention to personality and personal experience • user involvement and choice • hope • touch • dealing with ill defined symptoms • making sense of illness and • spiritual and existential concerns from the public health perspective we should stress that for the lay peoples good in the triangle lay people  medical doctor  cam practitioner should exist a communication but zollman and vickers report that there exist evidence that most people who have used complementary medicine did not tell their doctors about it  medical doctors can have and should have an important role in identifying their patients who use cam to minimize as much as possible the risk of harm of using cam treatments and as far as possible ensuring that their choice of treatment is in their best interests to achieve such a situation medical doctors should first be well informed about different aspects of cam and to establish appropriate communication with patients about using cam and sometimes with cam practitioners as well public health and its role in building bridges between conventional medicine and cam from the public health perspective in countries with predominant conventional medicine cam cannot be overlooked any more it is more and more clear that conventional medicine has become dependent on medical equipment and pharmaceutical industry which provides expensive technological solutions to health problems even when they are not particularly effective but this is only one problem  the other is that under the umbrella of scientific evidence based practices it has turned its back on holism and simple methods of intervention and much more it treats the common user of health care services as an object on the contrary contemporary user of health care services wants to be more actively involved in the process on account of its comprehensive philosophical perspective on health which covers several dimensions of population health need and not almost exclusively physical dimension what is a dominant characteristic of conventional medicine cam is widely accepted by the lay people we could even speculate that the consultation process and holistic approach adopted by practitioners of cam make patients feel in more control of their illness all this does not mean that the bioecopsychosocial model wishes to or should be replace the biomedical model of health the concern is more that the stress on the need for biomedical scientific facts is only one special method of understanding illness and health to depend only on biomedical facts denies historical and cultural depth conflicts between specialists from various professions have to be understood in the context and here public health has the role of building a bridge between them to contribute to the mastering of the bioecopsychosocial model of health which is the standpoint of various projects for the promotion of health throughout the world as well as in slovenia   what is relevant for the patient does not necessarily have to be relevant for the medical doctor and vice versa models of health beliefs  help us to understand to what degree a certain person is prepared to undertake medical activities with respect to his own understanding of health and disease and with respect to the consequences of not taking any medical action when being ill the way and the time an individual will attempt to satisfy his needs for health caretreatment also depends to a large extent on hisher integration into the social network surrounding himher  amateur reference systems meaning the social network through which individuals pass before they turn to professional counselling in essence adopt the social cultural standpoints knowledge and standards of the patients contemporaries regarding healthcare so it is often the patients social network which influences hisher choice of what where and when the patient begins to seek conventional or unconventional medical help those seeking help from unconventional medicine practitioners in slovenia were not protected by law or medicine there is the possibility of abuse of the searchers trust through the exploitation of his health problems and illness to make a profit and even worse through the intentional or unintentional waylaying from professional help which could have been successful and through direct threats to health with the use of harmful methods cam is a phenomenon which has to be monitored analysed and influenced through the prism of the biomedical and bioecopsychosocial theoretical models in order to be able to recognise both the dangers and the safety factors involved in its practice potential user should be informed about potential dangers in order to make an informed decision they also need reliable information on standards to be expected in relation to good cam practice as well as to know where they can find a competent and qualified therapist how they can check that this therapist is currently registered in the register of cam therapists but how this could be reached if not regulated even in countries with inclusive health care system like uk there exist enormous problems in reaching these goals   case study complementary and alternative medicine in slovenia cam in slovenia has officially more than  years long tradition  but its way towards recognition was and still it is thorny this case study reviews some important public health issues concerning alternative medicine in slovenia and then in the discussion with the assistance of various theoretical models comments upon the present situation and the possible steps to be taken basic unconventional medicine terminology in slovenia according to the new alternative medicine act in slovene language zakon o zdravilstvu  the official term for cam in slovene language is “zdravilstvo” what could be translated into english as “healing” in slovenia avoiding of the term “medicine” to designate other methods than conventional medicine is very strongly present the practitioners of unconvential medicine in slovenia are designated as “zdravilci” what in english language means “healers” but one could note that in the english translation of the title of the act the term “alternative medicine” is used thus we nevertheless could conclude that official term for cam used in slovenia when referring in english language is “alternative medicine” however there are many other terms used like “unofficial medicine” “unconventional medicine” “holistic medicine” “additional medicine” and “complementary medicine” in certain spheres also some contemptuous terms like “quackery” “dabbling” and “bungling” are used some perspectives on and attitudes towards cam in slovenia attitude of the state prior  prior the adoption of the alternative medicine act in  there was a legal confusion in the filed of cam in slovenia some of laws and which are still in force deal also with cam issue in the period after independency of slovenia  • the health services act adopted in  states in article  that “healthcare workers are permitted to use only verified and professional undisputed supplementary traditional and alternative forms of diagnostics treatment and rehabilitation which do not harm the health of people and which are approved by the ministry responsible for health with the agreement of the medical ethics committee”  according to planinsec  from the legal point of view it was important that legislator classified “supplementary traditional and alternative forms of diagnostics treatment and rehabilitation” in the chapter vi health care practice of the health services act what automatically mean that cam was classified as health care service but according to article  health care could be practiced only by health care workers among them medical doctors “according to the adopted health care doctrine and medical deontology code or other professional and ethical codes” permission to medical doctor to perform cam  from the article is issued and revoked by the ministry of health which also prescribes the procedures for approving such activities • the general practitioners services act adopted in  in its article  lays medical doctors an obligation that “they should by their otherwise independent work follow methods which are professionally and scientifically recognized and verified  medical doctors are obligated to do so also by medical deontology code article   which will be discussed in details later on additionally rules on medical licences adopted in  in its article  lays medical doctor an obligation that if heshe wants to have a licence heshe “must subscribe a statement that heshe would not practise healing and quackery”  • in the medicinal devices act  adopted in  later replaced with the medicinal products act adopted in  homeopathic medicinesproducts are included according to this law homeopathic product could be produced and sold only in pharmacies but only after adoption of appropriate executive regulation according to the eu directive es this regulation being rules on homeopathic products   was adopted in  first version was adopted in  but this sphere was regulated only on principle and legally could not be practised since homeopathy was not legally recognized as health activity it is obvious that prior  cam was regulated only on principle for medical professionals only but legally could not be practised since there was on one side a lack of executive regulations dealing with “supplementary traditional and alternative forms of diagnostics treatment and rehabilitation” in details and on the other side there were other legal regulations being acts or executive regulations which contained articles which were incompatible all this resulted in a magic circle of admissibilitynonadmissibility of cam practice in slovenia  present situation at the present characteristics of attitude of the republic of slovenia towards cam are • in early autumn  the new alternative medicine act  was adopted • for slovenia we could say that after adoption of the alternative medicine act it could be classified in the group of countries with tolerant system • the national health care system is still based entirely on allopathic medicine but some cam practices are now tolerated by the law • the classification of cam methodssystems is basing on nccam classification and according to the alternative medicine act article   methodssystems of cam healing activities presented in table  are allowed to be practised in slovenia • according to the act detailed definition of healing systems and healing methods is to be regulated by the minister of health • the healers chamber is authorized for recognition and acknowledgement of healing systems and healing methods as well as for controlinspection article  of the alternative medicine act  • cam could be practised only by healers which are according to the alternative medicine act article   adult physical subjects with at least secondary health education and passed exam regulated by the minister of health with valid licence of healer prescribed by the alternative medicine act  article  irrespective to this homeopathy chiropractic and osteopathy could be practised only by physical subjects with diploma of medical faculty and supplemented by corresponding knowledge on cam methods with valid licence of healer table  cam methodssystems that are allowed to be practised in slovenia according to the alternative medicine act  group healing systems healing methods • • • • • • • • traditional chinese medicine ayurveda traditional indian medicine homeopathy and other healing systems mindbody interaction methods biologically based practices manipulative and body based practices energy medicine practices but despite this enormous move forward we are facing fundamental information problems – there is informational asymmetry – and lay people in shortage of conventional medicine health care are »buying almost everything« what cam is offering them to restore or preservemaintain their good health attitude of health professionals medical doctors the attitude of medical chamber of slovenia the highest professional association of medical doctors in slovenia is strictly negative towards cam in the code of medical deontology of slovenia  there are several articles which express this negative attitude • the code lays medical doctors in slovenia an obligation to refuse to cooperate with people who are “illegally or unprofessionally concerned with the practice of medicine” article  and • “to practise only those therapeutic methods that have a scientific basis and have been accepted by the profession“ article  • according to code medical doctors are free to select their methods and ways of patient treatment but they are obliged to consistently follow the achievements of medical science article  • according to code medical doctor “can practise medical service only if hishe is registered in the register of medical doctors has licence for certain professional sphere and has appropriate education and qualification” article  also a lot of medical doctors themselves have negative attitude towards cam at its annual meeting in  the slovene medical society devoted all its professional debates to alternative medicine the meeting was entitled “alternative medicine is not medicine” at this meeting the doctors distanced themselves from nonstandard methods of work demanded suitable measures to be taken against members of the medical society who ignore ethical provisions and are using unverified methods and also addressed a warning to responsible people that suitable action must be taken when “healing” has bogus effects and when people are duped   however despite the formally negative attitude of the medical profession greater and greater interest is being shown by medical doctors and pharmacists especially in primary health care in some forms of treating patients that could be called alternative  interest is not only being shown in acupuncture  and acupressure which official medicine has already placed into the list of permitted health services  but also in methods which are being introduced into practice in some parts of the developed world such as meditation homeopathy  and chiropractics acupuncture was for example introduced in slovene health care services at the end of seventies and early eighties  proof that medical doctors in slovenia are constantly showing increasing interest is shown by the founding of professional medical associations such as the acupuncture association developed from the previously formed section of the slovenian medical society for acupuncture and traditional medicine  the society of homeopathy founded in  and inta  initiative committee for open dialogue of medical doctors on integrative medicine inta founded in  as well as various professional meetings discussing alternative medicine  the attitude of medical doctors towards cam has an interesting characteristics  it seems that they tolerate alternative methods more readily if they are used for prevention eg healthy diets sufficient exercise care for mental health etc while stronger conflicts arise when a very sick patient desires alternative treatment and the doctors themselves do not believe in such treatment for instance debevc recommends  “everything which a doctor knows which might be harmful must be unequivocally and decisively rejected if the patients dilemma is strong and the hope for successful treatment of cancer is questionable to such a degree that the patient wants to try one of the alternative methods of treatment then the doctor should tolerate this in order to be humane but on condition that the patient does not relent from postpone or neglect his standard treatment and that the patient does not pay too high a price for alternative treatment with respect to his means” in conclusion we need to stress that slovenia is beside sweden still only eu country in which there is a risk for medical doctors of being struck off the register of medical doctors if practicing cam  on the contrary in almost all eu countries medical doctors are allowed to practise any cam method even without any substantial training  however in slovenia medical doctors that are benevolent to cam methods are expressing their attitude searching for an open dialogue about this issue for several years now  other health professionals the other large group of health professionals which are searching for an open dialogue about cam methods being group of nurses  some research work on attitude of nurses to cam methods was done as well  the latest study results showed that in slovenia  of nurses that responded to the survey defined properly what cam methods are  among them  declared that they already used cam methods this percent is rather low in comparison to the attitude of nurses in other countries but the fact is that a major part of herbal medicines used in  of nurses is perceived as “traditional slovene art of healing” rather than cam  attitude of lay peoplepatients  although the prevailing attitude of medical doctors regarding alternative medicine is sceptical this does not hold for most of the inhabitants of slovenia this claim is supported by some studies which will be discussed later users of cam in slovenia there exist only scarce data on users of cam in slovenia what is a clear reflection of the attitude of the state institutions towards cam nevertheless there exist some data on this issue  reliable data on the characteristics of alternative medicine in slovenia can be gained from surveys in the frame of slovene public opinion surveys   in period  four surveys in    and  respectively included the question about using alternative forms of supportcare for ones own health the results are presented in table  table  using different methods of complementary and alternative medicine cam  in slovenia according to the results of slovene public opinion surveys for years    and    methods of complementary and alternative medicine special diets fasting macrobiotics herbal medicines acupuncture acupressure and shiatsu bioenergy radiesthesia massage chiropractic reflexology meditation autogenic training yoga tai chi dance therapy biorhythm astrology numerology homeopathy                                         in  frankic  discussed on the basis of a representative sample of  adult slovenes that  use alternative methods for selfmedication and that the share of women  was typically greater than the share of men among the products used twofifths are medications and threefifths are bought products when searching for symptoms that people most frequently treat themselves high temperature coughs and sore throats are first second are feeling rundown stress anxiety insomnia and tiredness third are preventive measures and fourth are aches in the back feet and rheumatism  an anonymous survey on alternative medicine  was conducted in  on an arbitrary sample of  patients registered with the general practitioners of the celje health centre the most important results of the survey show that  of those surveyed know of alternative medicine but their understanding of this was varied for  this is a method of healing which is not recognised by official medicine for  this is traditional medicine from a different cultural area  are of the opinion that this is treatment with natural healing substances and for  this is something else  were in favour of the use of alternative methods of treatment and  used alternative methods of treatment  when searching for influences on the use of alternative methods of treatment it was discovered that an important role was played by sex more women than men age older more than younger education the educated more than the less educated and purpose preventive more than curative especially with people who have completed higher education younger up to  years of age patients frequently opt for alternative methods without consulting their doctor while  of older patients consult their doctor before commencing such treatment or during such treatment among those using alternative methods  received recommendations and instructions for its use from literature  from the mass media  at courses and seminars and  from other sources alternative treatment is implemented by the patients themselves in  of cases  under the guidance of their doctor  with other family members and  with friends and colleagues  of the respondents could not say whether their chosen doctor was for or against alternative methods of treatment  were of the opinion that their doctor was in favour of using alternative methods while  responded that their doctor rejected alternative methods only  of the  people surveyed who used alternative methods were of the opinion that treatment was unsuccessful while  assessed their treatment as being successful and  as partly successful among those surveyed who used alternative methods   of them abandoned the treatment prescribed to them by their personal physician  of the users of alternative methods of treatment are in favour of these methods being included in a combination of voluntary and compulsory health insurance nearly the same share  are of the opinion that alternative medicine should be included in compulsory health insurance for voluntary insurance in this field  are in favour  are for selfpayment and only  of the users of alternative methods could not make a decision regarding such financing possibilities the results of the survey show that people know of various methods of alternative treatment that they are in favour of such methods of prevention and treatment and that they also use such methods we should also stress in this place that slovenia was the member of cost action b project   represented by a bion – institute for bioelectromagnetics and new biology  cam practitioners institutions and societies of cam practitioners in slovenia in the first place bion – institute for bioelectromagnetics and new biology should be mentioned  this institute was founded in  it was acknowledged as a research organisation by the ministry of higher education science and technology in  it transformed into the limited liability private company in its first years the aim was to investigate the as yet not very well understood phenomenon of the influence of various electromagnetic fields on organisms on the one hand this research area covered the influence of weak nonionizing electromagnetic fields on various living beings and on the other the still controversial question of endogenous  coherent electromagnetic fields in organisms and their role in the living process research in such areas inevitably brought the bion institute close to cam this was the reason that this institution obtained the status of a cost action b project national coordinator from  to  in the second place we need to mention the section of natural treatment therapeuts in the frame of association of small business at chamber of commerce and industry of slovenia  it was founded in autumn  to incorporate business and other legal subjects practising cam in slovenia beside above mentioned institute and integration there exist several other integrations of cam practitioners in slovenia among them being listed by date of foundation   • slovene acupuncture association in the frame of slovenian medical association  • slovene society of homeopathy shd founded in   • association of bioenergetics of slovenia zbios founded in   • slovene society for alternative medicine dam founded in   • slovene society for complementary and natural healing konaz founded in   there exist also special integrations aimed at education of cam practitioners among them • professional organization for basic and permanent education and qualification on the field of cam higea founded in   and • center for development of alternative methods of treatment enost with its school of integrative biorgonomics  very interesting is an integration which could not be classified only among cam practitioners integrations since it is an integration of medical doctors licensed and those practising cam  this integration is the initiative committee for open dialogue of medical doctors on integrative medicine inta founded in  and it is aimed at establishing open dialogue between conventional medicine and cam number of practitioners and their registration owing to the recent legal vacuum in our country the real number of healers in slovenia is unknown as are the types of “health” activities they practise but as cited by cerar  according to konaz estimation there are about  of them as cited by cerar according to verdel  between  out of them are qualified all others are probably seeking good earnings in this cam chaos in slovenia on account of desperate uninformed and helpless lay population some kind of insight in structure of cam supply in slovenia give the results of survey on state of affairs in the field of cam which was sponsored by the section of natural treatment therapeuts in the frame of association of small business at business chamber of slovenia the methodology was as follows   • time frame autumnwinter  • target population healers cam practitioners in slovenia about  • respondents  the results of this survey are as follows    business status of cam practitioners the results showed that  cam practitioners were practising cam methods as selfdependent entrepreneurs  as legal subjects  as amateurs and  something else or without answer  cam methods the respondents reported practice of following methodssystems according to nccam classification of cam methods • mindbody interaction methods and energy medicine practices in total  by method within this group following well known methods bioenergotechnology  reiki  radiesthetics  psychotherapy  meditation  yoga  regression  hypnosis  in this group also counselling for better quality of life is classified in this survey with  of responders claimed to practise • biologically based practices in total  by method within this group following well known methods diets  herbalism  bathotherapy  fasting  aromatherapy  bach flower therapy  • manipulative and body based practices in total  by method within this group following well known methods massage therapy  shiatsu  acupressure  osteophaty  reflexotherapy  physiotherapy  chiropractice  lymph dreinage  • cam systems in total  by system within this group following well known systems homeopathy  ayurveda  and traditional chinese medicine  the limitation of this study is clear – owing to unregulated cam sphere in the time of survey it was not possible to establish actual study population and consecutively the results are hardly representative nevertheless they give first insight in this problem grounded on the scientific methods on future perspectives of cam in slovenia from the public health perspective we welcome that our country finally adopted clearer stand towards cam but certainly this is rather a beginning than the end of a legal cam story in slovenia due to the undesirable and sometimes even dangerous phenomena associated with cam and due to relatively stable use of these methods table  it is strongly needed to regulate this field much clearer as it is today also cam is a phenomenon which has to be seriously monitored in a representative manner on general and in details and analysed and influenced through the prism of both the biomedical and bioecopsychosocial theoretical model in order to be able to recognise both the negative and protective risk factors involved in its practice this are the reasons that in the near future very important organizational as well as conceptual steps need to be done comprising many compromises and understanding among actors among the reasons that all this need to be done as soon as possible is the standpoint of the who  which supports and encourages member states to form their own health policies among organizational in the first place those steps which the alternative medicine act lays on responsible people are to be done  • to found the healers chamber and the register of healers • to establish a system for recognition and acknowledgement of healing systems and healing methods as well as • to issue licences for practising cam and • to establish competent bodies to control the market of healers in slovenia we believe that these steps will be realized in the near future when these steps will be accomplished it will be possible to evaluate cam in slovenia properly from more comprehensive and evidence based point of view conceptual compromises will be much harder to attain and we are well aware that it will take a lot of time to put the cam field and it’s dynamic somehow in order but all actors should become aware that it is the user of one or another health care practice who is the most important and for the lay peoples good in the triangle lay people – medical doctor – cam practitioner a communication should be established conventional medicine is responsible for evidence based approach to health problems including diagnosis and treatment of diseases but could be in certain situations complemented by other safe and from lay people appreciated approaches in this frame public health is among others responsible for clear and understandable terminology a priori opposition in intolerance to unconventional methods by conventional medicine causes more medical damage and social pathology than if it were offered on an opened scientific basis opinion and behaviour change is possible only in the long term via broadly founded health promotion programmes based on a science which not only takes into account biology but also the social economic and cultural characteristics of populations now when cam in slovenia is regulated we sincerely hope that our country will proceed alternative methods have to be studied clarified and joined with the measures of modern medicine when it is not harmful and where there is evidence that healing contributed to the improved feeling and satisfaction of people in health promotion and disease prevention especially in the frame of primary health care certain already proven cam methods could be very beneficent and effective in reducing burden of certain major public health problems in slovenia for example certain bodymind techniques like psychotherapy as an intervention tool for primary prevention could be perspective in reducing mental disorders burden of the population howsoever we could understand that also the international classification of primary care icpc used in primary health care since   is recognizing the longstanding observation that patients’ problems concerns complaints symptoms and other conditions a wide variety of social and psychosocial states that are not strictly biomedical there is another problem which is certainly not present only in slovenia speaking for developed countries the demand for health care has changed dramatically over the last  years due to changes in demographic structure increasing of real incomes improvements in medical technology and globalization of the world as the main reasons this is understandable since everybody wants to be healthy yet conventional medicine health care systems seem to be in almost permanent crisis and different kinds of waiting lists are longer and longer we are facing the infinite nature of human wants and the finite nature of resources available to produce health in these systems one way in which the problem of scarcity can be overcome is to let people buy the health care they want at the free market this  approach on the first sight seems to be like »a magic stick«  all treatments could be available if you want to buy them and have the money to pay for them this could and it is the case for example in cosmetic surgery but what would happen if all health care were bought and sold in the free market the common sense tells us that there would be an enormous inequity between people in attaining health care thus from the public health perspective health and health care are special goods as well as they are goods of especial importance for every country since good health of the population is its biggest capital and cannot be treated like other goods health and health care cannot be sold and bought like other goods and services on a free market but where is cam in slovenia in this story the health care system of slovenia is facing similar situation as the other systems in developed countries there is a shortage of health care system resources of all kind people are not treated as they expect to be treated and here cam is coming in the position but since cam is constantly rejected by official medicine it is not treated as being a health care service cam response is anticipated and the direction towards cam being a »perspective business branch« could be traced  this is certainly an extra alarm for public health in slovenia that cam must come on the top of the agenda yes it is »a business« but this business should be strictly regulated and inspected since it is dealing with a health of a population and there need to be a dialogue between conventional medicine and cam practitioners in conclusion we would like to refer to a remark written just above being that in shortage of health care system resources people try to find the best solution for them in searching to fulfill their health needs this population potential should be on the basis of integration of old and new cognitions transformed to a process of health promotion which has by its activities big potential to suppress harmful and dangerous types of cam as stated by eckenfels  building on classic conceptual schemes in social medicine in conjunction with the health care ecology model effective and efficient health promotion programmes in the context of “health for all” concept health for all population structures on all levels could be prepared in context of this concept especially striving for comprehensive primary health care is important active participation of people in comprehensive primary care will be the guarantor that they will take over responsibility care and behaviours for their health which corresponds with their specific health needs and on scientifically recognized cognitions in the process of reorientation to comprehensive primary care big political and managerial engagement is required in all sectors and on all levels of societal organization in another words we need healthy public policy  without changes in this direction unplanned and partial bumping into cam is like struggling against windmills exercises task  carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module if necessary read recommended readings as well critically discuss with your colleagues • the terminology in cam field and • characteristics of cam  task  from domestic eg biomedicina slovenica and cobisscooperative online bibliographic system of slovenia in slovenia andor international bibliographic databases eg medline pubmed find out if anything is published from the field of cam in your country if yes then try to find out its characteristics and how cam is treated in your country eg what kind of health care system do you have in relation to cam the attitude of conventional medicine doctors to the cam etc task  if not try to find an example from other countries in europe except for the uk task  critically discuss with your colleagues how different european countries treat cam references  merriamwebster online dictionary available from url

module students and public health professionals should have accepted pluralism in health care approaches alternative medicine is becoming the important factor in health care in most countries of developed world generally that development was enabled by spreading of postmodern comprehension within the western weltanschauung postmodern comprehension both enabled deconstruction of dominant health paradigm and stimulated acceptance of pluralistic attitudes in matters of health care so alternative medicine is travelling now on a rather fast track through medical institutions and even through most solemn medical campuses of developed world of course there is no doubt who is holding the reins there so in order to cut through power plays of powers that be it is crucial to be aware of distinctions between alternative and official medicine the differentia specifica of alternative medicine could be understood by dropping out of cartesian paradigm and by turning to the basic postulates of holographic paradigm after introductory lectures students will participate in discussion it might be helpful to put an emphasis on personal experiences andor personal engagement of

therapeutic systems and technologies that have originated from the tradition of vitalism ie from the tradition based on the assumption that the man nature and the universe are all permeated with the life force  vis vitalis due to that origin in the countries of the first world during the former millennial transition between xix and xx century alternative medical systems and technologies were pushed into the background  the mechanistic medicine took over and established as a science practiced monopolistic control for almost one century however the ongoing millennial transition brought a significant change in the status of alternative medicine alternative medicine sometimes under the name complementary medicine started to acquire a significant role in developed countries especially in western europe and in northern america where until recently it was not only marginalized but ostracized as well regarding that “surge” of alternative medicine within the developed world indicative is the example of united kingdom in  british medical association published the report in which alternative medicine was discarded as something that was “not in accordance with natural laws”  seven years later though in the new report british medical association informs that more and more physicians are looking for the information about “nonconventional” therapies and recommends both teaching of “nonconventional” therapies at medical school and establishment of postgraduate programs in order to inform physicians with techniques used by alternative practitioners and with possible benefits for patients  one of the reasons for this turnabout was probably the decision of the department of health that in  acknowledged consumer demand for national health service access to alternative medicine and gave the goahead for family doctors to employ alternative practitioners as ancillary staff at that time quite a few general practitioners were already funding alternative treatments through their health promotion clinics and according to one survey  of general practitioners expressed their wish to provide alternative medicine through their practice  more recent surveys suggest as many as  of general practitioners either practice  vis vitalis is known in many cultures in china and japan it is known as chi in tibet as srogdzin in india as prana in old iran as gallama among dakota indians as wakam among sioux as oren alchemists called it vital fluid and paracelsus munia stambolović v medicina  nadležnost i alternative medicine responsibility and alternatives prosveta beograd   alternative therapies themselves employ nurses who provide them or delegate treatment to alternative therapists working in the practice elsewhere  according to the more recent study of primary care workers general practitioners nurses and other primary care team members  respondents had previously referred or influenced referral for cam treatments the main reasons cited were patients request  and conventional treatments failed   the number of alternative therapists in uk is also growing rapidly from  to  the number of registered practitioners trebled from about  to about  new data indicate that this number amounts to   and a bbc poll of  people in august  estimated that  of the public are using alternative therapies each year which contrasts with a figure of  in a similar survey six years earlier  in addition it was estimated that  of the uk population can be expected to use one or more cam therapies in their lifetime  in other western european countries  to  of the adult population report using one or another form of alternative health care during the year  and regarding surveys of the use in general ie some time or other during the course of several years percent of use reaches  in germany  in israel in  in a survey of adult population  stated that they had used the service of an alternative health care provider  in australia the government estimates are that each year  of australians use alternative medicine  editorial  in   canadians reported consulting one or more alternative health practitioner in the past six months  in usa the use of alternatives to official medicine has steadily increased over the past decade with reported use from  in   to  in   regarding position of alternative medicine a turnabout similar to one in united kingdom happened as well namely in  american medical association guidebook for consumers called alternative methods “unproven disproven controversial fraudulent quack andor otherwise questionable approaches to solving health problems”  also as recently as in  the new england journal of medicine published a number of articles case reports and letters about specific alternative treatments all were found useless andor harmful the editors defined alternative medicine as medicine “that has not been scientifically tested and whose advocates largely deny the need for such testing”  however in  american medical association stopped to refer to alternative medicine as “quackery” and has an official position calling its members to learn more about it  in addition in  the editors of the journal of the american medical association ranked alternative medicine as the third most important topic out of  for the journal to cover their readership survey found alternative medicine ranked seventh most important on a list of  topics the journal should be addressing  according to the recent california study sixtyone percent of physicians do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable about cam safety or efficacy and  would like to receive more education on cam modalities  along with these data regarding use of alternative medicine the most significant indicator of its growing acceptance is its transformation from a marginal entrepreneurial activity into a part of the corporate economy simply stated alternative medicine is becoming big business in united kingdom for example the figure for private spending on alternative therapies is in the region of a billion pounds compared with the overall national health system expenditure of  billion pounds   in australia in  the total expenditure on alternative therapies or remedies by private individuals was over a billion australian dollars  in  the expenditure on alternative therapies rose to  billion  in canada it is estimated that in  a total of  billion was spent on complementary and alternative health care  billion on alternative therapies  million on herbs and vitamins  million on special diet programs and more than  million on books  in usa the total expenditure on alternative therapies or remedies by private individuals doubled between  and  from  to  billion dollars  market has become so large that both major drug companies and media conglomerates found that alternative medicine is a highly sought after and profitable commodity that example of the alternative medicine’s acceptability to corporate world is both a reflection of its acceptance in the larger community and a harbinger of stillgreater acceptance to come as the forces of corporate advertising marketing and distribution are brought into play why in the developed countries during millennial transition the alternative medicine has begun to take on the quality of a distinct entity with its own institutions and recognized by governments media and the public  there were several reasons for this public political and economic acceptance the first reason was the simultaneous existence of high prevalence of chronic diseases on one side and an obsessive preoccupation with health on the other side leading to the paradox of a healthy but sicker society that paradox leads to the everhigher expectations of health care and to the development of the awareness that spectacular hightech rescue is not enough  along with that the transition from industrial to postindustrial society with the shift from manufacturing to service industries offered those in advantaged positions greater opportunities to build rewarding employment and careers and to develop lifestyles which promote health  so a specific population developed highly educated identifying with the values of feminism environmentalism holistic philosophy and spiritual or personal growth and with increased interest in lifestyle change they were the first to embrace alternative medicine ie its offers of health promotion and lowtechnology treatments  the second large group of faithful alternative medicine users was coming from three specific patient groups in the first were patients with longtime treated chronic conditions in the second were patients with aversion to the reliance of conventional medicine on highly invasive or high risk treatments and in the third one were patients with mild to moderate long term functional and stress related undifferentiated conditions  the number of users further increased due to the belief of alternative medicine users that alternative medicine is more efficient then conventional one  further interest for alternative therapies was raised by patients who were satisfied with provider conduct ie with alternative therapistpatient relations characterized by more holistic open and partnership based approach comparing to the communication difficulties and perceived lack of concern for their wellbeing perceived in relations with practitioners of official medicine   the popularity of alternative medicine has been attributed to consumerism as well  it seemed that people extrapolated to medicine a “pick and mix” approach and felt free to use the ideas and treatments they found relevant to their own particular needs due to several reasons alternative medicine was increasingly accepted by physicians and other practitioners of official medicine at first their patients were asking for alternatives a major factor was also a shared dissatisfaction with consumers about the biomedical model and mainstream health care system some practitioners were looking for modalities that might help when they did not see their patients getting better with official approaches some were interested in continuing education and some in economic opportunity and a lucrative market  in the time of rationing of health care the important reason for increased acceptance of alternative medicine was possibility to use alternative therapies to reduce costs in the glastonbury study between  and  around  patients were referred to specially establish alternative medicine service following their initial alternative medical treatment there was for most a marked reduction in the use of other health services for the problem referred the largest reduction occurring in those who had been the heaviest users of other services prior to referral visits to general practitioners dropped by around a third the reduction in the number of prescriptions was even more marked and again it was the highuser group that the largest reduction took place a similar reduction was seen in the numbers of further referrals tests and other treatments required for the group for the condition referred analysis also revealed that  of patients have reported some or much improvement in their condition after treatment  similar results were reported when alternative medicine was included in treatment of separate nosological entities like cardiovascular diseases  lower back pain  pain relief  and rheumatoid arthritis  the position of alternative medicine was further promoted by its institutionalization i e by development of the same kind of institutions that were developed by conventional medicine international peerreviewed specialist journals in alternative medicine are emerging studies of alternative medical practice already appear in established conventional publications quite a few universities have developed degree programs in alternative therapies while quite a few of medical schools have begun to include material dealing with these approaches in the undergraduate curriculum in united kingdom for example in  more then  medical schools were offering courses on alternative medicine as part of the curriculum  of course alternative medicine would never have this kind of acceptance without “informational highway” the internet and the world wide web have become important sources for information about alternative medicine with sites providing abundant information and hundreds of relevant links what during many years of confrontation between alternative and official medicine a relational identity was permanently imposed on alternative medicine namely the permanent condition was to define alternative medicine by measures regulations and patterns of official medicine  at first that relational identity was promoted by alternative practitioners themselves supported sometimes by friendly official therapists out of wish to secure legitimacy to their therapeutic engagement later relational identity was being permanently imposed by physicians and medical officials who were treating alternative medicine from the position of power and control both of these orientations were in fact putting alternative medicine on the procrustean bed namely the result of both orientations of aspiration to become accepted and of practicing of power was either mutilation of alternative medicine or construction of nonexistent extrapolations alternative medicine just could not be decoded in that way because of its immersion into a different narrative narrative emanating from holographic paradigm holographic paradigm could be defined by four postulates  according to the first postulate there is no entity that could be defined as pure matter or pure energy “every aspect of the universe exists as a kind of vibrational expression” by that postulate the cartesian split into material and nonmaterial is overcome all aspects of universe are characterized as “interference patterns” whose identity nature style or consistency depend on “external” and “internal” context according to the second postulate “every aspect of the universe is itself a whole a comprehensive system containing within it a complete store of information about itself” as this information must not necessarily be coded in a specialized system like central nervous system by that postulate the split into living and nonliving is transcended it is actually implied that every aspect of the universe is in some fundamental way alive because besides vibrational expressing it contains some kind of knowledge about itself according to the third postulate “every aspect of the universe seems to be part  the concept of paradigm was introduced by thomas kuhn kuhn defined paradigm as “constellation of beliefs values techniques and so on shared by the members of a given community” as an expression of the specific weltanschauung paradigm plays an important normative function so much so that it governs its followers namely paradigm is supplying the conceptual “box” which is restricting all followers scientists working within the frame of a certain paradigm behave like they have been programmed paradigm provides them the criterion for selecting the problems to be solved it provides an assurance that those problems have the solution it sets out the rules by which those solutions are to be sought and often it provides a prediction of what those solutions will be phenomena that will not fit the conceptual “box” are often not seen at all that is why normally “scientists do not aim to invent new theories and tend to be intolerant of those invented by others instead normal scientific research is directed to the articulation of those phenomena and theories that the paradigm already supplies” it could be concluded that proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds they see different things when they look from the same point in the same direction of course they are looking at the same world and what they look at has not changed but in some areas they see different things and they see them in a different relations one to the other that is why “when paradigms change the world itself changes with them” see kuhn ts the structure of scientific revolutions second edition enlarged international encyclopedia of unified science vol i and ii foundations of unity of science vol ii no  the university of chicago press chicago   of some larger whole some more comprehensive system” and each of these larger wholes is “an expression of the dynamic of its parts” as various systems or entities are intertwined through their common subsystems this postulate indicates the indivisible wholeness of the universe the second important implication is that each constitutive element even the smallest one participates in expressing of larger systems of whish it is a part according to the fourth postulate “since each aspect of the universe expresses itself vibrationally and all vibrational expressions intermingle every aspect of the universe contains knowledge about the wholes within which it exists and about every other belonging aspect” and that means that each aspect of the universe carries the seal of its context ie some basic knowledge about its “outer” world holographic paradigm and alternative medicine open a possibility of a new health narrative namely modern narrative is less and less seen as the final truth in medicine as well moreover various deconstructive tendencies are taking place of up to recently domineering technological optimism these tendencies have brought with the new concepts and even the new institutional culture leading toward significant role change of both patients and physicians physicians are being deprofessionalized and instead of former patients subordinate compliant passive respectful and in awe of physician  cocreators of personal health are emerging at this stage of transition of course it is not easy to speak about the new medical narrative still there are patterns that are emerging  the first one is wholeness it appears that human being as active and turbulent aggregation of vibrational probabilities is indivisible that human suffering can not be understood by analysis of isolated organs and symptoms that the full meaning of local disturbances could become comprehensible only through their inclusion in wholes of which they are a part the second pattern is individualized approach namely transformations of human vibrational expressions can not fit into the nosological compartments neither could they be successfully confronted by a standardized treatment the principle of wholeness is directing towards principle of idiography treatment develops into some kind of relational art the third emerging pattern is selfacting namely the belief in technology is replaced by the belief in human being ie the belief in human self healing capacities in that way the goal of therapy seizes to be imposing one’s rule over human being the main therapeutic function becomes stimulation and support of the inherent abilities of the patient as the cocreator of health the fourth emerging pattern is connectedness with physical cultural and social environment namely the principle of selfacting does not imply isolation although independent human being is not selfsufficient being inseparable part of its environment human being is incomplete that is why there is no healing of human being without healing of hisher physical cultural and social environment the fifth emerging pattern is personalized relationship and for developing of that kind of relationship both deepening of relation between cocreators of hisher own health and hisher supporter and the creation of intersubjective space by them are indispensable that is important for better understanding of human suffering that is also important in order to evade now frequent situation in which health provider produces disease by hisher professional attitude  the sixth emerging pattern is nonaggressiveness the point is that the dominant therapeutic mind is obsessed with control it has vertical penetrability tending to grab and destroy symptoms the principle of support is horizontal it is aiming for the human being as a whole it is pro not antibiotic it is acting in accordance with the “wisdom of the body” so it builds restructures helps overcoming and integration and the seventh emerging pattern is principle of accessible knowledge that principle primarily means the development of the knowledge of support instead of the knowledge of power namely instead of knowledge seized by specialized professional elites and confined to closed institutional orbits principle of accessible knowledge is opening possibility for knowledge enabling selfhelp and mutual help that principle also leads toward further deprofessionalization of therapeutic activity transforming it into a simple and sometimes spontaneous human behaviour all seven patterns are operational within alternative medicine that does not mean that alternative medicine must be the basis of the new medical narrative it means only that it is up to each of us to decide what each of us is going to support because according to the holographic paradigm “each system on all levels and sublevels is an expression of the dynamic of its parts”  and that means that every one of us is making a difference references  brown re rockefeller medicine men berkeley university of california press   payne j black d brownlee g cundy jm mitchell gm quillam jp rees l

approaches and technologies in dmp implementation at present almost all health care systems are concerned mainly with ensuring equity access high quality and efficiency of health care a very important aspect of quality especially in public health is its relation to scientific knowledge about effective interventions the concept of disease management programmes dmps has been introduced to implement evidencebased clinical practice through guidelines care protocols etc to improve coordination among healthcare providers and assure continuity and comprehensiveness of care dmps organize health care in multidisciplinary multicomponent proactive approach focusing on the whole course of a disease using evidencebased standards of care there is no single definition of a disease management programme because of their diversity and heterogeneity they are characterized by three main features a knowledge base a delivery system with coordinated care components and a continuous improvement process the

management in bulgaria mariana dyakova emilia karaslavova dobriana sidjimova theoretical background disease management programs dmps in the last decade health care systems across the world are concerned mainly with few questions continuity of care especially for chronic diseases avoidance of medical errors and patient safety effective and efficient delivery of health services and avoiding excessive variations in practice  most of the countries in the world health organization european region have implemented national strategies for quality assurance such as accreditation systems hospital quality management or external assessments such as league tables or audits  a very important aspect of quality especially in public health is its relation to scientific knowledge about effective interventions high quality care can be achieved only when interventions that work are applied to the right patients at the right time  improving quality of medical care and health services is thus a matter of defining and promoting best clinical practice translating evidence from research into practical work namely developing evidencebased guidelines or recommendations and performing health technology assessment quality of health care delivery is not however only a matter of evidencebased practice organizational and structural aspects of the health system and delivery also have important implications a lack of continuity of care may delay appropriate measures duplicate services and lead to uncoordinated interventions  the concept of disease management programs dmps has been introduced to implement evidencebased clinical practice through guidelines care protocols and formulary lists improve coordination among healthcare providers and assure continuity and comprehensiveness of care  dmps organize health care in multidisciplinary multicomponent programs in a proactive approach focusing on the whole course of a disease using evidencebased standards of care  there is no single definition of a disease management programme however it is characterized by three main features a knowledge base a delivery system with coordinated care components and a continuous improvement process  the key elements of disease management are  − comprehensive care multiprofessional multidisciplinary combining acute and longterm care disease prevention and health promotion − integrated care – “continuum of care” coordination of the different components of the health services delivery − population orientation  defined by a specific condition − active clientpatient management tools  health education empowerment selfcare − evidencebased guidelines protocols care pathways  drgs − information technology  system solutions − continuous quality improvement  dmp represents a total management of disease and health services as a method for development of active consensus in the state mobilizing different stakeholders and responsible institutions in order to fulfil the health priorities set it is not a legal act or administrative document but rather a comprehensive national strategy requiring professionalism systematic and integral approach characterized by  − solidarity and justice in the health system − universal access to medical services − high quality and continuity of health care − effectiveness and efficiency of health services − horizontal and vertical management of the planned interventions − decentralization and multisectoral partnership following these basic principles of the new public health  is a governmental responsibility on the way to reach the final goal and priority of any health system – promotion and protection of population health and strengthening the human capital of the country in this context the management of any disease is realized through coordinated and integrated care focused on the entire preclinical and clinical development of the disease early diagnosis treatment and rehabilitation as well as towards health promotion and disease prevention through reduction of risk factors levels in the living environment introduction of healthy behaviours and lifestyle and increasing the quality and effectiveness of medical services the dmp is a broad term comprising of various methods forms of interventions organizational approaches and technologies they are very heterogeneous consisting of diverse sometimes unique components developed for specific demographic health social economic political or cultural settings considering this it is completely impossible to create a unified model of a dmp or to translate it to another national context the basis for the development of a nationally specific and effective dmp is the correlation “population necessities – available resources” this is a difficult and responsible analysis requiring a multidisciplinary team which should consider  − the health needs and necessities of certain entire  target population and the society − the specific methodology of programme development goal stages control etc − the provision of recourses for the programme – mainly financial human information − the effective management of the resources − the coordination of all participants in the programme – individuals and institutions − the monitoring control and evaluation of the dmp and − the capacity for sustainability and improvement of the programme for a longterm period critical factors in the design of a successful dmp  − suitable target condition target population − evidence base relevant scientific research  − − − − − consideration of barriers to implementation strategies to change attitudes of stakeholders balance of economic and quality of care goals strategies for continuous quality improvement and strategies for evaluation of costeffectiveness implementation of dmps for total management of chronic diseases chronic diseases and especially cardiovascular diseases cvd account for most of the burden of disease in the european region  recent evidence shows that there is a strong need to improve the quality of care for people with chronic diseases although a number of effective interventions for management of various chronic conditions are promoted by the international health organization there are still wide variations in the delivery of care and clinical practice dmps are one of the measures intended to address this situation most of the evaluated dmps for chronic conditions have been shown to improve the management and control of the disease namely diabetes depression chronic heart failure and cardiovascular diseases  the evidence from the implemented till now dmps in different countries and settings can be summarized in the following conclusions  − dmps seem to be suitable for conditions for which there are wide practice variations and poor outcomes due to problems in continuity of care and finding evidence of interventions’ effectiveness − dmps reach a better control of the underlying condition mostly for cvd shown by reducing the risk of hospitalization among heart disease patients − improved rates of medical performance suggest that dmps succeed in shifting care from a reactive approach reacting to manifest complications to a proactive one anticipating potential complications − dmps enhance the adherence of providers to evidencebased standards as well as enhance continuity of care and improve patients’ knowledge of their conditionillness − in defining the goals of a dmp it is important to achieve a balance between quality of care satisfaction of providers and patients and cost − disease management requires behavioural changes in both providers and patients − a system of performance and outcomes indicators is considered an essential component of a dmp to ensure its continuous quality improvement − the disease management approach needs to have a longterm perspective − no evidence is available for any recommendation about the ideal mix of interventions − no evidence is available about which components of a dmp are most important for improving quality of care − there is no evidence of a direct link between dmps and significant reduction in mortality or of improvement in quality of life − there is no evidence available about longterm health outcomes − there is no evidence on costeffectiveness of dmps  however the absence of evidence does not mean absence of the effect it means it has not been studied the strong focus on a particular disease risk factor or symptom has also been claimed to be one of the possible negative effects of dmps however there is no evidence for this the longterm impact of dmps on health and health care systems still needs to be evaluated the impact of dmps on patients’ and providers’ satisfaction also remains to be assessed  cost and costeffectiveness of dmps for chronic conditions when dmps were introduced for the first time in the united states their primary goal was to achieve cost savings  the implementation of dmps requires substantial investments the cost of developing and establishing a program including training and information technologies especially hardware and software needs to be considered in evaluations of disease management  the available evidence about reduced episodes of hospitalization and reduced rates of complications from chronic disease have been claimed to be potentially costsaving however there is not enough evidence to conclude that dmps are more costeffective than standard care another important gap relates to the ideal allocation of resources to the different components of a programme therefore it is important to study extensively the costeffectiveness of any specific dmp and its components before it is introduced on a largescale potential ethical considerations concerns have been raised about the ethical and social implications of dmps  patient autonomy might be threatened by the reduction of freedom of choice resulting from standardization it is also necessary to identify who should play the coordinating role in a dmp and what implications this may have for the responsibilities of others  many dmps have been developed with the assistance of commercial interests notably the pharmaceutical industry concerns have been expressed about potential conflicts of interest in the health care system  conclusions  the organization of care in multidisciplinary multicomponent programmes with a proactive approach focusing on the whole course of a chronic disease applying the ideas of evidencebased medicine for the formulation of standards of care can be considered the core of dmps the heterogeneity of dmps and their dependence on context complicate the transferability of findings to other settings other than those of their evaluation there is no single dm model to be applied everywhere it is not possible to identify an ideal mix of components for a dmp to be effective dmps improve the quality of care of people with chronic diseases as measured by performance indicators however there is no evidence available on dmps’ impact on survival quality of life or on their relative costeffectiveness there is a need to evaluate the economic social and ethical implications of disease management programmes  examples of ongoing dmps in europe maastricht project  in january  a dmp for patients with diabetes was implemented in the maastricht region in the netherlands the explicit aim is to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes the programme’s elements are a core team of general practitioners nurse specialists and endocrinologists cooperation with other caregivers eg ophthalmologists dieticians protocols stating routes of care responsibilities and tasks provision of care according to clinical practice guidelines and systematic collection of data about patient contacts in order to monitor each patient and assess practice variations among providers national service frameworks in the united kingdom  the  government white paper set out the plan for the modernization of the british nhs as a result national service frameworks nsfs have been established by the nhs to enhance the quality and efficiency of the system strictly speaking the nsfs are not dmps however they represent a systematic effort to improve care for particular conditions or groups of patients and share some elements of disease management they approach the whole course of a condition and the state’s comprehensive strategies to organize care with the aim of improving outcomes the nsfs set national evidencebased standards of care including organizational interventions formulate service delivery strategies and establish performance measures to evaluate progress german disease management programmes  the health care reform act from  provided the basis for the implementation of dmps in germany the programmes are offered by the health funds must be accredited by the federal insurance office a governmental agency charged with the supervision of social insurances implementation of dmps is linked to financial incentives for the health funds as enrolled patients are calculated separately in the intersickness fund risk compensation mechanism evidencebased minimum standards and criteria for enrolment are proposed by the coordinating committee a selfgoverning body including sickness funds and providers representatives and subsequently passed by the ministry of health and social security case study cardiovascular disease management programme – the case of bulgaria introduction and background cardiovascular morbidity and mortality – present situation and trends bulgaria takes one of the leading positions in total and cvd mortality in the european region and the negative tendencies are continuing in the last  years cardiovascular diseases are causing  per  deaths for  or more than  of the total mortality  the cvd indicators as hospital discharges of ischemic heart disease per  –  for  and of cerebrovascular diseases per  –  for  are also disturbing  the results from the largest national epidemiological studies conducted in the last  years “sofia heart study   ” “bulgaria heart study ” as well as the results from the cindi programme show evidence of higher levels of preventable risk factors and higher individual and population absolute risk compared to other european countries   these negative trends are considered mostly a result from recently developed unhealthy lifestyles and behaviours related to the transition period but also from the continuing and unsuccessful health care reform started in  leading to insufficient disease prevention late diagnoses ineffective treatment low compliance of physicians to international guidelines and of patients to recommended therapy and lifestyle changes  at the same time hospital mortality from acute myocardial infarction is close and even lower than some european hospitals which indicates that the qualification of specialists especially in hospital care are still on a good level  the pointed facts as well as evidence from other relevant studies allow for the following assumptions  − low quality and effectiveness of the primary care gps especially when concerning the level of qualification organization motivation for improvement compliance to contemporary best practices and implementation of health promotion and disease prevention activities − ineffective emergency care related to lack of financial material and human resources − insufficient personal responsibility information and motivation for selfcontrol and selfmanagement of the health status − insufficient state and public responsibility for introduction of evidencebased equitable and effective health care − continuing organizational problems and chaotic reforms in the health care system characterized by • lack of managerial and governance capacity • lack of integrated information system and chronic disease registries • lack of working system for quality assessment and control • inefficient allocation of financial resources • insufficient official standards and guidelines for good medical practice • lack of incentives for the health providers and • lack of trust in the population activities undertaken to address the problem bulgaria is still waiting for its new national health strategy last one adopted in  and for a national strategy for prevention and control of chronic including cvd diseases in  the government adopted a programme called “bulgaria ” where a “national programme for control of cardiovascular diseases” was announced  no specific action plan activities or any results have been published under it till the present moment however there are single legal orders and risk factor control programmes adopted for example against smoking diabetes control etc bulgaria is also participating in the international intervention programme for integrated chronic noncommunicable diseases prevention  cindi programme  the national centre for public health protection has recently published the “who cvdrisk management package for low and mediumresource settings ” translated in bulgarian  prevention activities and published guidelines  establishment of a national committee for development of guidelines for clinical practice of general practitioners gps  with members from bulgarian scientific society for general practice the national association of the gps in bulgaria and the bulgarian hypertension league   start of a permanent cme course for high blood pressure and

guidelines for assessment and control of high blood pressure  − practical recommendations for management of high blood pressure according to the eshesc guidelines  − guidelines handbook for general practitioners in the case of high blood pressure  − information and education materials – leaflets brochures books for the patient nevertheless there are no officially adopted medical standards for cardiovascular prevention and treatment there are no effective mechanisms and incentives to motivate the health care providers to follow the published recommendations and not enough public educational programmes based on the analysis of the available european and national epidemiologic and other studies a comprehensive evidencebased national cardiovascular disease management programme has been developed here its basic components are presented without any detailed explanations or activities strategic longterm goal decrease the cvd incidence and mortality increase the quality of life of cvd patients and the healthy life expectancy hales in the bulgarian population operational shortterm goal successful implementation of a cardiovascular disease management programme and development of a national evidencebased longterm strategy for chronic disease control and prevention in bulgaria programme objectives − − − − health promotion and cvd risk factor prevention early detection and treatment of underlying risk factors early diagnosis and treatment of cvd and secondary and tertiary prevention of cvd leading principles of the programme − chronic noncommunicable diseases and especially cvd should become a priority for the national health policy  − the main responsibility should be taken by the government but decisions and activities should be multisectoral multilevel including all policies and spheres − strong state control and regulation of health determinants and threats − strict prioritization and control in financing and subsidizing − specific capacity building in health care focused on longterm care of chronic conditions − continuous adaptation and improvement of the health system and increasing quality and effectiveness of care − consistent policy for making healthy choices  easier choices − implementation of evidencebased interventions related to population necessities and national specificity − early continuous and lifelong risk factor and disease prevention and health promotion − increasing personal responsibility for health – “personal empowerment” − strong public participation social commitment and support for health – “social empowerment” and − development and setting up of “healthy public policy” – health in all policies intervention spheres groups − surrounding environment political social economic and ecological – environmental protection social inequalities etc − individual personal health protection – behaviour knowledge skills motivation lifestyle − population free of disease risk management – detection and

monitoring of their effectiveness iii stage – final   year analysis and evaluation of the results achieved and development of action plan for the next period monitoring and performance indicators in order to improve dynamically the programme and its interventions periodic analyses should be performed and feedback received some of the possible indicators are total risk assessment of representative sample of the population cvd incidence trends during the period level of patients’ compliance and adherence patients’ satisfaction behavioural or attitude change etc expected results some of the specific results to be expected from the proposed programme are − better coordination continuity and effectiveness in the health sector • better risk assessment and detection of high risk groups for cvd • better control and prevention of risk factors • better treatment and rehabilitation of cvd patients • implementation of evidencebased standard protocols guidelines and recommendation for good clinical practice • increased motivation and compliance of health specialists − − − − − − decrease in the cvd incidence increased economic effectiveness and efficiency development of a national register for cvd diseases increased health awareness and culture of the population increased social participation and commitment decreasing inequalities in health etc  financial sources for the programme − − − − the government and ministry of health ncphp municipalities ngos foundations associations etc the industry and other business etc conclusion the problem of cardiovascular diseases in bulgaria can be only addressed by means of complex longterm and comprehensive approach including shortterm and longterm interventions in the framework of a national programme strategy for management of cvd  it cannot be solved through temporary onesided activities all interested stakeholders and institution should participate in the programme implementation and analysis discussion and possible restrictions of the model the proposed programme does not claim to be costeffective or costsaving as clear evidence for this is lacking it is also important to point out that this dmp of cvd does not include all possible approaches interventions and activities for reaching the final goal of the programme this is only a model an example of a comprehensive evidencebased dmp for cvd exercises task  the students are asked to figure out significant public health problems for their country individual work then in an open discussion together priorities are set up according to the specific national settings task  the students are dividing into groups of  to  every group chooses a priority problem and develops a design of a dmp the models are presented before all students and a discussion about their strengths and weaknesses is initiated references  shaw cd kalo i a background for national quality policies in health systems copenhagen world health organization   federal ministry of labour

naturalistic approach in public health • differentiate use and results of quantitative and qualitative approaches • identified main use and importance of naturalistic approach • recognize possibilities for naturalistic approach use in public health practice the use of qualitative and consensus building techniques enables better understanding and improved collaboration among “policy stakeholders” politicians administration public health professionals and community involved in needs assessment and health policy formulation war migration and transition in south east europe hardened most of public health activities but especially made the process of health needs assessment and formulation of health policy very difficult qualitative analytical methods have been introduced in croatia over the last  years nine croatian cities and  croatian counties created citycounty health profiles and citycounty health plans by using qualitative methods the greatest gain from introducing the qualitative analytical approach is wider participation in planning and managing of the resources for health at all levels from community and regional to national level qualitative analytical

theoretical background importance of introducing new paradigms – qualitativenaturalistic approach ideological similarity between the philosophy and practice of health promotion and the assumptions and procedures of naturalistic approach has facilitated the introduction of qualitative methods into the public health practice health promotion believes in the ability of individuals nonprofessionals to generate useful knowledge and insights whereas qualitative methods grant a research value scientific legitimacy to individual subjective experience both tend to be inductive as opposed to classical deductive approach and derive general principles from particular facts health promotion holds that a solution to a problem can come from the bottomup community rather than the topdown national level and professional experts the same is believed in qualitative research which starts from the idea that concepts and explanations are best generated from the bottomup from particular empirical data rather than the topdown ie from a general theory  as a result of the transition war and postwar experiences citizens in south east europe see are faced with a lack of social security and limited possibilities to influence changes in the society most of these problems were caused by rapid changes from socialist government with centrally planned economies to democratic governments and more marketbased economies variations in socioeconomic factors have had strong impact on the health systems of the countries and the health of their citizens  appropriate public health approaches and methods can make significant contribution to the enhancement of social justice more than ever public health is being viewed as a catalyst for peace and an important factor in the socioeconomic development equation during the last fifteen years public health became insufficient due to wars economic and political changes there is a recognized lack of competence in public health particularly in health management and strategy development but also in health surveillance policy analysis and prevention apart from rapid changes and changed context public health is faced and with many limits and shortcomings of “official” institutionalized practice  war migration and transition in the region hardened most of public health activities but especially made the process of health needs assessment and formulation of health policy very difficult all health indicators obtained at that time were based on estimates of a key factor – population yet today  years after the transition has began and  years after the war has finished croatia still has two crucial public health problems poor accessibility of health indicators at a local level and non  inclusion of the community opinion these reasons led to an initiative to implement a different corrective mechanism in public health practice – qualitative analytic approach enabling formulation of health policy from nonstandard sources three detailed examples will show how results of qualitative analytic approach can be grounds for needs assessment priority rating and health policy creation case study croatian experience in utilization of qualitativenaturalistic methods the establishment of the idea of health promotion in the late s and especially the practical experience in its implementation through the “healthy cities” project during the s has changed public health approach and research practice in croatia participatory methods of community health needs assessment needs have been implemented in the mids but a practice of establishing local databases such as the development of local area indicators in the uk is yet to be developed we believe that conventional and positivist approach as used so far does not reach local communities over the last ten years qualitative analytical methodology has been introduced in the different areas of public health activities needs assessment priority setting planning decision making and strategy development in croatia methodology was used on three different levels  city level  assessment of community health needs and based on these findings production of the city health profile and the plan for health  county level  assessment of community health needs and based on this findings production of the county health profile and the plan for health studies of complex human healthrelated behaviour in their natural environment healthy counties program  regional level  strategy development for intercounty regional level city level rapid appraisal to assess community health needs the most popular and most used method in the croatian cities is the method of rapid appraisal to assess community health needs it was used in  cities between  and  pula metković rijeka karlovac varaždin zagreb split dubrovnik crikvenica the advantages of this method in comparison with classical approaches to health assessment are as follows it can be done quickly in two months from the start it does not take too much expert time and financial resources approximately  eur per city it is participatory representatives of different groups of citizens participate in the process from needs identification to solution finding includes representatives of city authorities institutions and organizations as well as those from nongovernmental and nonforprofit sector sensitive ability to reflect local particularities valid scientifically sound actionoriented as a product it gives shortterm and longterm activity plan and its achievements are sustainable it establishes and facilitates cooperation among key stakeholders in the project via priority thematic groups  academic credibility of this method is strengthened by the establishment of strict selection rules of participants and panellists and by the process of triangulation of both information sources essays observations and collected objective indicators from the system and researchers experts of three different backgrounds public health epidemiology and medical information science by use of this qualitative method combined with available quantitative indicators health needs assessment was carried out in  in rijeka which was used to devise a city health profile and a city health plan the outcomes of ‘rijeka – healthy city’ project were evaluated in  rijeka – healthy city healthy city has been active in rijeka since  till  its activities were mostly determined by the aftermaths of war and economic slump croatia was suffering and focused on caring for the refugees and the displaced people as well as helping the socially disadvantaged in  the city department for health and social welfare of rijeka started devising the city health profile and the city health plan rapid assessment of the population health needs was used to devise these documents following the suggestion of the project team about seventy panellists were selected comprising representatives of the city administration important city institutions and the citizens who were all asked to write an essay on health in rijeka in the working meeting held at the end of june  the participants were presented the most interesting and the most common answers from their essays as well as statistical health indicators in the city and the photographs taken based on their reply to the question what it was that diminished and added to the beauty of living in rijeka the participants then chose three most important problems first individually and then in small groups taking into consideration the choice made by the groups a joint list of five priority areas was made to be used in future rijeka – healthy city’ project  sustainable development  advances in environment protection  support for disabled people  quality of elderly life  improvements in children and youth’s health in  due to the need to evaluate the outcomes of the ‘rijeka – healthy city’ project an analysis of the changes was carried out for the period between  and  three sources of information were used for the evaluation a  quantitative health indicators defined by rap b observations made by the project participants both “veterans” and “fresh forces” from  gathered through work in focus groups c analysis of program documents and resolutions passed by the city administration the evaluation results showed the following    quantitative indicators of health and quality of life in rijeka more reflect demographic economic and epidemiological transition that other urban areas in croatia are undergoing as well than they speak about outcomes of the healthy city project analysis of participants’ observations pinned down the key areas in which change is evident • community participation in decisionmaking intersector cooperation “the project has met all its basic goals its direct users in the local community created and participated in it rap stressed the specific needs of this local community the actions were taken in logical order according to set priority list – and were complementary resources were mobilised in the local community joint planning and activities facilitated cooperation between interest groups whose activities are complementary…” • upgrading people’s awareness “the project’s value lies in giving individuals responsibility and realising that everything they do have some kind of effect they as individuals are responsible for people become aware that what we do today is good for their children… healthy city project helps us do the most we can given the circumstances we live in… work on the project results in the awareness of the pride that it is our city and that i am responsible for my city… the people’s awareness has been upgraded in a satisfactory manner relation toward the disabled and the elderly we succeeded in fostering intergeneration socialising in local community ie in connecting our oldest and youngest citizens the people became aware of the need to preserve the environment water air dangerous waste management…the outcomes of the theme groups’ work and the project itself show resistance to the sign of our times to do only what pays no matter what happens • undertaken activities exceed the expectations undertaken activities range from removing architectural barriers labelling parking places for disabled people lowering public telephones… the biggest achievement was done in the area of help provided to elderly and disabled people the healthy city youth council was founded the youth became more interested in active participation in the project as well as in civil society making use of the space the project has opened for them…the media coverage was very good many social programs in rijeka were encompassed in the project new associations were founded and started work attracting many volunteers environment situation was improved – gas sewerage water waste management…the presentation of every bigger project is a chance to discuss modes of avoiding possible pollution and taking measures for protection… additional value of the project lies in the continuing ‘generation bridge’ activity which was exceptionally well accepted and has the greatest value in connecting socialising and decreasing isolation of elderly people through activities with primary students and children from various associations… the prominence of rijeka was proved by its advanced solutions in health promotion of various segments of the  population  analysis of the program documents showed the following • evident positive approach to health by the city administration guidelines of rijeka city councilthe  guidelines of rijeka city council in its introductory part pay much attention to the analysis and evaluation of economic and social environment and the city’s social profile according the resolution by the city of rijeka therefore not as provided by the legislation but as their own additional obligation resource allocation provides for “minimum  of total revenues for the social program” • broad grounds of the ‘rijeka – healthy city’ project  over  organizations have been involved departments of the city administration institutions public associations companies through programs for priority areas  associations are financially supported • a large number of ‘rijeka – healthy city’ project “products”  publications two books  action groups that have continually been carried out  program projects in accordance with selected priorities and  researches qualitative methods used in evaluation process were more precise than quantitative methods in detecting changes their outcome and importance for rijeka gathered change indicators were presented to the public at the consensus conference held on  june  at the premises of rijeka city council around fifty conference participants politicians professionals and members of citizen’s initiative came to a conclusion that “the first phase of the project – focusing – has been completed” priorities were identified and remain the same “and the main challenge of the project is to continue bringing efficiently together all parties interested in solving the identified problems and developing mutual trust and cooperation” it is necessary “to maintain the existing achievements and to further upgrade them providing vision for future in urban planning economic and human development of the city” outcomes of ‘rijeka – healthy city’ project have been highly rated on both national and international levels these recognised outcomes were the grounds for accepting rijeka as a designated project city in the fourth phase of the ‘healthy city’ project of the european who office county level county public health capacity building “healthy counties” program it is the “county public health capacity building healthy counties” program that has used primarily naturalistic and participatory approach in the counties health needs assessment program started in march  by the september   croatian counties successfully finished education it has resulted in county health profiles and plans for health in  out of  croatian counties with  clearly defined public health problems as priorities in each county all the three key elements of the  participants in the project were included in the health needs assessment at priority setting the politics the profession and the community with emphasis on intersector cooperation each plan for health confirmed by the top political bodies in each county councils represents the starting point for introducing a change in public health practice at local level at the same time it also allows for formulation of a complete national health policy that would include the community cities and counties opinion one of the most frequently recognized priorities among counties was high alcohol consumption among adolescents it was selected as a priority in  counties studies of complex healthrelated behaviour such as drinking patterns in young people in virovitičkopodravska county linked to the “county public health capacity building healthy counties” program represents a more novel way of using qualitative analytical methodology in croatia they are still in the initial phase of research it is in this area that the phenomenological approach used to understand human behaviour through experience of the participants has been shown most efficacious by using qualitative methods interviews and by observing listening and investigating the participants of the process at every level waiters school psychologist er physicians and teenagers local researchers from virovitičkopodravska county have gradually started to understand the investigated phenomenon in the context of their own social environment the aim of this study is to recognise particular behavioural patterns associated with excessive drinking and to develop effective interventions specific in the given social context regional level change of public health practices using qualitative naturalistic approach it was the ‘healthy counties’ project that showed that some priorities such as care for the elderly are the problem shared by all parts of croatia the information that the elderly have been selected a priority in eleven out of the fifteen counties included in the ‘healthy counties’ program based on the health needs assessment by use of quantitative and qualitative methods provides the grounds for designing intercounty action plan in order to design action plans for the elderly further use of qualitative research methods is needed elderly care due to the demographic transition in croatia the elderly people older then  are the fastest growing subgroup in the general population due to the census data  there is  of elderly in the croatian general population comparing  and  census data in some counties we registered increase in elderly population of more than  unequal incounty distribution of elderly ie much higher percentage of the elderly in rural lowdensity populated areas and islands up to  makes situation even more alarming despite the problems evident from the statistical data local authorities failed to respond to them and offer intervention such a state was due to lack of adequate methods for evaluation of specific needs and analysis of details of the problem required for the intervention the first step toward the solution was taken through the ‘healthy counties ’ program which used qualitative and quantitative methods interviews focus  groups semistructured questionnaires to design county health profiles and priority setting analyzing the problems of the elderly research was carried out in several elderly groups and their family members including the professionals engaged in the work with the elderly as a result  counties and the city of zagreb described the problems of the elderly even through local specific needs and included them in their action plans wwwzdravigradovicomhr in the second step representatives of all participating counties and the city of zagreb were brought together for a special conference of all project teams to discuss the problem of the elderly the conference was aimed at deepening the problem analysis and comparing and analyzing joint and specific difficulties the counties are facing the conference goal was to devise joint guidelines that would serve as basis for design and implementation of the intercounty regional elderly care plan participants worked in small groups and plenary sessions which led them to the conclusion that the system lacked  sufficient knowledge of elderly peoples needs what we usually have are more providers estimates than users concerns  a good overview of existing resources institutional noninstitutional that provide for the elderly since everybody is providing for the elderly no one is really responsible  mechanisms in place to support collaboration between users providers and county policy making bodies and  comprehensive elderly care policy and a plan for action at the county level the following separate problems were identified  lack of political interest among county officials  lack of interest in collaboration between providers between providers and county policy making bodies and between users and providers  lack of funding for enlarging existing or introducing new services  misunderstanding and confusion about “who is doing what” because of the absence of comprehensive elderly care policy and a plan for action at all levels municipality county country  lack of knowledge of “what should be done” and by whom the obtained results will form the grounds for designing action plan on the problems of the elderly in croatia activities related to more detailed needs analysis will start in april  with emphasis on identification of specific groups without findings of qualitative analyses it is not possible to focus activities on problem causes on identifying specific subgroups and their needs or adjusting the intervention programs to specific needs of the social environment participation of political structures in the planning process will ensure political framework necessary for longterm “healthy” policy conclusion the job of public health professionals including those in academic setting is not only to investigate and understand the world it is also to change it this is why in post  war transitional croatia the emphasis has been put on the development of applied action research by which the academic knowledge may be used for intensifying activities and development of local communities the basic principle of qualitative analysis – to explain the causes and build the theory on the basis of fieldwork – describes the best the difference between the empirical and naturalistic approach in research qualitative data provide a rich and detailed description emphasizing the context in which the experience occurs and allowing us to gain insight into and deep understanding of a process which is not possible by use of other methods postwar situation migrations and the process of transition were the reasons why it was not possible to generate credible demographic analyses statistical studies and quantitative health indicators therefore use qualitative analysis was chosen as a corrective mechanism in the formulation of health policy the system was so weakened by aforementioned objective reasons that the application of these very methods which could empower and strengthen the community was an imperative in all described cases qualitative and quantitative methods were combined inter sectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration was used in all stages of the processes emphasizing crucial role of the involvement of all three key parties politicians administration public health professionals and community by this triangulation of different approaches to the same problem we increased the validity of our findings the introduction of qualitative and consensus building techniques in the policy formulation process in croatia has brought much better understanding and improved collaboration among “policy stakeholders” politicians administration public health professionals and community at the moment the greatest gain from the introduction of qualitative analytical approach and participatory methods into the practice of croatian public health is the achievement of a higher degree of participation in planning and managing of the resources for health at all levels from community and county to national level references  miles m huberman m

after completing this module students and public health professionals should • be aware of different strategies in development of general practicefamily medicine • recognize needs for health care reforms in primary health care • know the characteristics of different models of organization of general practicefamily medicine • improve the knowledge and understanding of the of function of the health care system address for correspondence keywords learning objectives abstract the health reforms went diverse ways in different countries but everywhere under powerful influence of political economic and social changes the market principles were proposed and not very successfully applied to a situation of poor and apparently egalitarian systems the importance of primary care was underlined but it was often disintegrated overspecialized and inadequately supported facing a burden of social problems the centralized state solutions as well as participatory social movements had only momentary effects so that strengthening of local and family capacities supported by a team of generalist professionals emerged as the best choice it was advocated by empirical results in most of developed countries based on experience from croatia and other countries the strategies were identified for implementing the generalist professional approach as a basis of phc services firm political decision vocational training and development of professional identity of general practicefamily medicine physicians and nurses were essential starting points organizational arrangements academicscientific support and international relations have to stabilize further development  independent contractual relation of professionals with financing institutions and group practice in form of integrated small health centres appear to be the best nucleus of primary health care teaching methods specific recommendations for teachers assessment of students introductory lecture exercises individual work and small group discussions • work under teacher supervision individual students’ work proportion  • facilities a teaching room • equipment internet pc and lcd projection • training materials readings hand – outs the final mark should be derived from the quality of individual work and assessment of the contribution to the group discussions  strategies for development and strenghtening of general practicefamily medicine as part of primary health care želimir jakšić theoretical background recent health care reforms and primary health care the rapid changes in type of health needs visible ageing of populations social problems such as migrations unemployment growing social divisions and insecurity more knowledgeable patients with higher expectations hopes in technological panacea mounting costs of health services all of them together triggered the new wave of health reforms in all countries it is under strong influence of deep turn from egalitarian to libertarian views high expectations are associated with market principles and free enterprises in economics what is reflected in social health and other public services  the effectiveness efficiency and equity in health care quality and satisfaction of people with services are the essential goals of reforms as an important factor emerged the generalfamily practice which according to experiences may influence radically the health system in the desired direction the evaluation studies in most developed countries showed that both rational use of resources and satisfaction of people may be influence by services in which a considerable role is plays generalfamily practice  according to circumstances and traditions the countries have diverse positions and stress different expectations the economic and costcontainment concerns where at the top in most countries followed by equitable distribution of services many others follow like implementation of subsidiary principle involving families and local communities substitution of institutionalized care by home care etc essential intentions in developing primary health care for st century the great change from egalitarian to libertarian paradigms in economics social and health policies is still influencing tensions inside health sectors the big international organizations from the same un family have conflicting views eg who and world bank stressing different approaches to further development the world health report “life in the st century  a vision for all”  and the new global policy “health for all in the st century” stress social problems and poverty as main contribution to ill health still follow the predominantly egalitarian approach and build on successful experiences of growing acceptance of primary health care strategy “building on primary health care health systems should be community based and comprehensive including promotive preventive curative and rehabilitative components available continuously closely linked at all  levels to social and environmental services and integrated into a wider referral system” “maximum freedom should be sought for local services…longterm care should be primarily provided in the community through nonhospital institutional care and homebased services” however no specific organizational form of care is envisaged and less stress is given to participation and economics now popular in health reforms contrary the social aspect is stressed a decentralized sustainable and scientific evidence based care meeting the social cultural and spiritual needs of different groups is recommended fostering innovation and human resources for health are among essential health system functions in the proposed new european who policy document  the targets are more specific as eg target  “primary health care with a familyoriented health services at its core” “by the year  at least xx of people in member states should have access to a physician and a nurse of their choice both specialized in family health as a first level of care and to other specialist services when required this target aims at • by the year  all countries having adopted the basic concepts of integrated primary health care services based on professional team work and adequately supported by secondary and tertiary hospital services • by the year  the principle of family health physicians and family health nurses working at the core of this integrated primary care service having been accepted by all countries …” for better understanding it is also important to quote a who document named “framework for professional and administrative development of general practicefamily medicine in europe” a it comes as a result of a contribution of several who collaborating centres for primary health care in europe first as a draft of a “charter for general practicefamily medicine in europe” in  after wide discussions in over  international and national associations and professional organizations of physicians and of general practitioners as well as other health professionals contributing to primary health care in europe the revision of the draft charter was produced in a consultation meeting in copenhagen  in the section on purpose of the document one of conclusions is “general practice can thus contribute to an effective and efficient primary health care service of high quality which should positively affect the workload and quality of specialized and hospital care” in the following section the characteristics of general practice are described and as the main titled “general” one can read “general practice addresses the unselected health problems of the whole population it does not exclude certain categories of the population because of age gender social class race or religion or any category of complaint or healthrelated problem it must be easily accessible with a minimum of delay access to it is not limited to geographical cultural administrative or financial barriers” under section on conditions for the development of gpfm the structural conditions discrete general population working environment close to patients and  referral system organizational improvements and professional development are mentioned very important issues are described under professional development such as • specific education and vocational training required for all those to become a family physician • quality development through audit carried out in peer groups • role and function of academic departments of general practice • research • development of effective professional organization the essentially same political statement was repeated  years later b summingup one may conclude that the experiences gained from health reforms are becoming a realistic input for health policies on turn of centuries the simplified traditional libertarian solutions of individualism and free enterprise introduction of health market corrected by high moral standards and charity are not a guarantee against growing social problems and weakening of social networks as answers are offered two traditional lines of understanding what is most important for primary health care • the first technical stressing evidence based medicine high standards of quality efficiency and professionalism a line closer to libertarian philosophy and to traditional public health • another line stressing the need of equity in health as basic right of people subsidiary community participation and empowerment strengthening of primary groups like neighbourhoods and families a line closer to egalitarian philosophy and to so called “new public health” both separately are a try against dominant social currents and practices appealing to human rationality tolerance social concern and solidarity an important hope but without final proof the new pragmatic policy as presented in quoted documents are recognizing need of unifying both approaches as it is presented in a new attitude towards generalist professionals gpfm at roots of the health system facing this orientation practically all countries have to revise their practices developed developing or new established states many different ways could be envisaged increasing diversity of practical solutions in different circumstances reflection on experiences a new approach to generalfamily practice a new approach to gpfm was considered in all european countries ccee  the situation was different in some countries even the clear notion was not present about what is and what should be the gpfm in others the long tradition petrified some approaches inappropriate to new tasks the different strategies were necessary but essentially they may be defined in several groups of elementary strategies their relative importance might vary according to different phases of development the particular elements were installing or reforming training vocational training different forms of continuous education and participation of practitioners in undergraduate training changing the financing of health care “privatization” contractual relations of professionals with the financing agencies selfcontribution by patients the  reorganization of services individual and group practices changes in division of work at the primary level different types of managed care raising the social and professional status of gpfm  unfortunately the feeling of urgency has influenced some mechanical shortcuts and contraproductive impositions of health administrations the destruction of entrepreneurial selfconfidence instead of flexible supporting of its development the transitional phase is far more complex than it was expected models are less transferable among countries propositions and perspectives are not quite understood and seemingly undesirable population is conservative and threatened by changes the new challenges are not welcomed by the “silent majority” the enthusiastic minority might be confronted with many difficulties needs support and the strategies have to be specified and thoroughly carefully thought about the major strategies are similar but their form and timing will differ although many experiences already exist simplification and schematization may lead to errors this general consideration should primarily serve as a frame for consideration of every individual strategy and a way to exchange experiences and not as a proposed prototype however the moves triggering change are similar table  choice of major strategies in different phases of development major strategies  constructing support by phase  start and initial growth public image and patientssatisfaction international relations reintegration of primary services collaboration rationalization political recognition and support vocational training new identity professional empowerment and organization academic role and position rd reflective exchange of experiences personal care and quality practice  phase  positioning in the system phase  building int strength phase  sustained empowerment the table  is combining a choice of elementary strategies of which the first five are predominantly based on “external” activities originated by governments health administration etc while the second group of five are predominantly intrinsic ie initiative is expected by profession itself the most important longrange strategy is reliable provision of personal high quality cars and patient satisfaction the triggers pushing the change are usually political recognition of gpfm as important and unavoidable element of health system and vocational training leading to technical selfconfidence and entrepreneurship after these first steps the “intrinsic” strategies were usually essential for further development professional empowerment taking over academic positions and tasks and gaining managerial skills these strategies could hardly be successful without open communication and close collaboration with partners and finally institutionalization of integrated primary care services described strategies depend on circumstances but to become successful have to be based on a proactive flexible and openminded behavior of the gpfm profession beyond correction of poor practices the greatest gap between intentions and real achievements of phc and gpfm was the wider outlook on care in community and collaboration with all partners sectors and services the major role in choosing proper solutions has to be given to people them but a technically informed advice is necessary an important strategy in developing gpfm is to continue and further develop the traditional role of general practice to be advocate and consultant to people even to protect them in case of insulting marketing of health and medicine however it cannot be achieved if regarded only as a superficial correction of accustomed behavior learned during administratively lead system it also depends of a deep rooted insecurity and ambiguity learned by vague overall definition of primary care there is poor understanding and differentiation of certain “kinds” of primary health care using similar and familiar terms but with opposite meaning ie comprehensive selective community or family oriented primary health care the comprehensive or integrated primary health care is the choice because it has growing role confronting the contemporary problems in developed countries elderly poor and chronically ill and those with psychical problems it is more complex and difficult than selective approach it stresses the need for team work consultations and collaboration all what is making troubles and regularly hated and avoided by independent practitioners how to combine the personal care with that broader openmindedness is a real challenge  building up awareness of the new role independent thinking based on practical experience establishing a selfconfident professional organization will certainly in most newcomers be a sign of mature achievements obstacles and what one can do about them unfortunately in many of older and quite a few younger professional organizations the internal tensions are inevitable and common this tensions and conflicts may  considerably weaken development majority of obstacles to development are “imported” obstacles actually reflecting conflicts of the wider system these may be grouped in two clusters a one predominantly reflecting general social and political situation eg • double face of health politics verbal support and financial deprivation • remaining concepts of “selective primary care” and “primary medical care” • demanding patients and aggressive bureaucrats in health administration b another reflecting the relations within the wider medical profession eg • power structure inside health services and among medical professions • “closest neighbours worst enemies” generalist versus specialists like internists public health specialist nurses paramedical • traditional approach to training in medicine and vocational training a hidden conflict is more difficult to solve between the group of “pioneers” and the group for which is gpfm only a “second job” some successful “managers” overloaded women and similar groups the one of most important resistance are related to stimulation of the “silent majority” the leading group should not loose the touch with the far larger group proclaiming “do not shake the boat” many different reasons and in some countries the learned obedience discipline in front of authorities fear and insecurity might be explanation for choosing waiting as the best solution because “gps will always somehow survive” training concrete joint activities technical project proper information and networking should be the uneasy but important solution fragmentation inside profession among generations ruralcity groups academic and others gps different market coalitions because of small issues among neighbours etc is usually not dangerous but needs timely deliberation strengthening professionalism the building of professional consciousness understanding of needs for professional solidarity and longrange thinking about far reaching common interests with patients other professionals and community development of own dignity selfconfidence and adequate social position is a long process  successful strategies for development and strengthening the profession may be summarized as follows • networking professional solidarity and organization of activities • outspoken technical and ethical standards • patient mobilization and support • clever tactics inside professional and political circles • relying on own strengths forwarding “own” technical and administrative support • development of own academic basis and influence on training programs • international relations world wide perspectives the time has been nearly forgotten when views related to primary health care were against medical establishment opinion existed that it would be possible to  implement ideas of phc without participation of professional practitioners similarly at the other end a belief dominated that general practice is responsible only for personal care on request of individuals not necessarily taking into account the community in which they work and live it was a history of love and hate trust and mistrust but better understandings are now prevalent it may look as a rather long search for obvious although it may be even now a reason for dispute general practicefamily medicine gpfm is developing as an interface between clinical medicine and public health community medicine an example of people oriented integrated medicine it is a potent bridge between science and human care prevention and treatment biological psychological and social understandings individuals families and communities a science and an art of living  the process has not yet been settled a realistic approach to participation of people and of different other sectors in phc has to overcome tempting ideas that free market will automatically empower people to participate and influence health care the awareness is maturing of growing costs and limitations of free medical practice in a society divided by richness and opportunities the right behavior has to be accepted by practitioners of all kinds to secure long range mutual interests beyond their particular immediate interest however we may accept with satisfaction that the basic mutual understanding is present and collaboration accepted by all sides this should be the starting point in discussing strategies for strengthening generalfamily practice a “winwin” solution was rediscovered by professionals and all other participants the game is not finished the main influences are coming from sociopolitical issues nevertheless the gap between intentions and realities seems to be as great as ever the main support to primary health care policy was “for all” strategy in development declared in almaata  however after economic recession in early  and downfall of “egalitarian” “socialist” political systems in  the neoliberal and free market philosophy as the main engine of global development the confrontation of those powerful and wealthy with those suppressed and poor become evident not only in terrorist attacks and military revenges but also in diminished solidarity among and between countries under emerging sociopolitical condition heal care was one of offers in structural adjustment policies imposed by world trade organization world bank and particularly international monetary fund  although some international organizations such as world health organization unicef and unesco further supported “for all” policies in health and education they were weakened and the situation in the field started to alarm united nations at the turn of centuries and millenniums united nations developed millennium declaration and later through millennium project and global fund tried to reach targets in  “ eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  achieve universal primary education  promote gender equality and empowerment of women  reduce child mortality  improve maternal health  combat hivaids malaria and other diseases  ensure environmental sustainability and  global partnership for development”  however it is already clear that millennium targets will not be achieved and some of the issues are understood in different ways  the old fight between  promoters of genuine comprehensive horizontal primary health care and selective vertical programs of primary care become visible particularly in conflicts about funding how it is in a destructive way attacking generalfamily practice in europe is well seen from an address of the organization of family doctors wonca and a number of other international organizations called strengthening primary health care “ by ”  “…we propose that by   of the budgets of vertical diseaseoriented programs be invested in strengthening wellcoordinated integrated local primary healthcare systems and that this percentage would increase over time such an investment would improve developing nations’ capacity to address the majority of health problems through a generic wellstructured primary health care system” summary      the gpfm in the context of primary health care has an important role next to people complementary to other services and often as a conductor of the orchestra the existing experiences show movements in all countries most of them are in good direction to improve relevance efficiency equity of services and satisfaction of people but still needs time to evolve or reform themselves there is a gap between general solutions and real practices the type of organization of phc is not successfully recognized so that further evaluation of practices and experiments are needed the problem of “privatization” as a tool for change and the old problem of health centres and integration of primary services are presented based on experience in croatia essential elementary strategies for development of generalfamily medicine are identified as • longrange relevance and quality of personal services and satisfaction of people • starting vocational training development of identity and political support • strengthening professional organization and academic developments • institutionalizing reorganization of service management • sustaining national and international networking evaluating experiences diversity and different dynamics in combination of elementary strategies and different ways of development should be expected proactive approach and flexibility are most important possible internal and external obstacles are identified among them the passive expectant majority from inside and the vague governmental support and aggressive health administration from outside are considered as most threatening the role of the recently issued who document framework for professional and administrative development of general practicefamily medicine in europe is important to present the intentions of gpfm and introduce them to other partners as well as to strengthen their internal homogeneity  case study experiences from croatia croatia shared many of the worst experiences of violence power struggle and unsolved economic social and political problems during the last years it can be illustrated by quantitative data the social problems  of war victims unemployment elderly and poor are described in table  table  selected

a comparison with macedonia and slovenia in tables  and  shows some similarities but also striking differences some of indicators in comparison with those before  show the widening gap between croatia and slovenia and some of closer formal similarities with data from macedonia the situation is described as a croatian paradox that with worsening of general conditions the usual health indicators have shown so far a tolerable degree of health indicators  however one of the overlooked reasons explaining beneficial outcome might be the tradition of a decentralized system strong and independent primary health care and great personal contribution of professionals during the war until now the decisive contribution of primary health care and especially general  practitioners is not well recognized because more attention was given as it is usual to specialized and hospital services as it is well known and documented the importance of generalists and primary care was well conceived in croatia rather early in comparison with other countries the significance of integrated preventivecurative health centres was important in spite of lately overmanaged or bureaucratic organization of

changes in financing and some reorganization  the health fund was centralized and organized as the croatian institute of health insurance in the closest possible way collaborating with ministry of health the resources have in one period diminished to one third of those immediately before the new croatia started to exist public health was reorganized as a centrally administered separate service including institutes of public health but also peripheral units previously working as part of health centres medical centres were “dissolved” into original parts hospitals health centres and institutes of public health  the case of “privatization” the “privatization” of primary care physicians was proclaimed as a major health policy but continued with hotcold tactics in support of “free” private practices and of strict administrative and financial control of services the positive move was insisting on free choice of physicians by people although the actual implementation was limited protecting existing services and some powerful groups of professionals the important next step was introduction of contractual relations between primary care physicians and the health insurance under condition of restricted resources and threat of loosing job the contracts have been largely dictated by health insurance administration the resources have been limited but the proclaimed rights of people further covering complete care as before the “rationing” of prescriptions given to individual practitioners was standardized to the averages by definition half of people having less than it was usual mostly in urban areas and half more than enough if some demands of patients have not been fulfilled professionals were regularly found responsible administrative measures and material punishments were implemented for those who exceeded the standardized rate of patients on sick leave this has put majority of professionals in an insecure position derogating their technical competence and humiliating them publicly on the other side many shortsighted tactics and “children diseases” of privatization were common among most ambitious  of “completely private practitioners” advertisements promising impossible unnecessary additional medical interventions complementary and alternative procedures misuse of technology etc for all physicians in primary health care from  the planned mandatory leasing of premises from health centres was introduced as a kind of limited fundholding and semiprivate position to coordinate and protect interest of physicians the chamber of

students and public health professionals should • differentiate between group and team • recognise different types of groups • be aware of and identify possible roles within a team • understand the group development process • be aware of both advantages and disadvantages of teamworking abstract because there are no pure formal or informal organisations in real world one may conclude that an organisation is a mix of formal and informal groups thus its performance depends on the management ability to recognise the existence of these groups to transform them from groups into working teams to motivate and stimulate them to achieve organisation’s goals we must differentiate the concept of group versus the concept of team a simple definition of the group can be two or more persons who come into contact for a purpose and who consider the contact meaningful a team has to accomplish bigger goals than any individual group the purpose of a team is to perform achieve results and be successful in the organisation or marketplace the literature describes several types of groups according to a set of criteria formal groups work team is created by an organisation in order to achieve a certain goal being recognised and receiving full support from the organisation informal groups arise from natural attractions among individuals for social reinforcement or other benefits they seldom share the organisational objectives and have a temporary basis the roles within a team actually represent tasks and functions in  the selfmanagement of the teams activities belbin developed a test to identify individual team roles many teams go through a lifecycle of stages firstly identified by bruce tuckman in  as forming storming norming and performing this model has become the basis for further models of group development principally adding the th phase of adjourning if there are many advantages of the teamworking there are also disadvantages that should be considered by a manager when building a team teaching methods specific recommendations for teachers assessment of students teaching methods include lectures group discussions group assignments  first assignment consists in selfevaluation of the roles played in a team by each student based on belbin questionnaire for the second assignment the students will be split in groups of  persons and asked to solve the “survival” exercise each group should evaluate the performance of the team in the process of decisionmaking versus the individual performance  work under teacher supervision   individual students’ work no special facilities or equipment belbin questionnaire and survival game should be distributed during the course assessment could be based on multiple choice questionnaire mcq structured essay seminar paper case problem presentations oral exam etc  team building adriana galan silvia gabriela scîntee theroretical background introduction generally either formal or informal organizations constitute together the organizational setting where work is performed as described by organization design theory a formal organization is characterized by approved authorityresponsibility relationships clear division of work and separate departments and usually a hierarchical structure the formal organization is the planned interrelationship of people material resources and activities  by contrast the informal organization is characterized by dynamic behaviour and activity patterns taking place within formal structures due to human interrelationship and interaction because there are no pure formal or informal organizations in real world one may conclude that an organization is a mix of formal and informal groups thus its performance depends on the management ability to recognize the existence of these groups to transform them from groups into working teams to motivate and stimulate them to achieve organization’s goals nevertheless to build an effective team is a resource consuming process and requires a complex activity group versus team we must differentiate from the very beginning the concept of group versus the concept of team thus a simple definition of the group can be two or more persons who come into contact for a purpose and who consider the contact meaningful  the purpose of a group may be implicit rather than stated another definition of a group is two or more persons who communicate and share common values norms and needs  to conclude there are three minimal requirements to form a group  group members are sharing common needs or objectives  there is a strong interpersonal communication component within the group  there is a minimal or even absent hierarchy within the group a team represents a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose performance goals and approach for which they are mutually accountable  a team has to accomplish bigger goals than any individual group the purpose of a team is to perform achieve results and be successful in the organization or marketplace a good manager is those who can assemble a group of individuals and transform them into a team there were described ten key differentials to help a manager to shape a group of people into a proactive and productive team   understandings in a group usually in formal groups members think they are put together for administrative purposes only individuals sometimes cross  purpose with others in a team members recognize their independence and understand that both personal and team goals are best accomplished with mutual support time is not wasted attempting personal gain at the expense of others  ownership in a group members rather tend to focus on themselves because they are not sufficiently involved in planning the organizational objectives in a team members feel a sense of ownership for their jobs and unit because they are committed to valuesbased common goals that they previously established  creativity and contribution in a group members are told what to do rather than being asked what the best approach would be suggestions and creativity are not encouraged in a team members contribute to the organization’s success by applying their skills knowledge and creativity to team objectives setting  trust in a group members distrust the motives of colleagues because they do not fully understand the role of other members expressions of opinion or disagreement are considered troublesome or nonsupportive in a team members work in a climate of trust and are encouraged to openly express ideas opinions disagreements and feelings  common understandings in a group members are so cautious about what they say that real understanding is not possible game playing may occur and communication traps be set to catch the innocent in a team members practice open and honest communication they make an effort to understand each others point of view  personal development in a group members receive good training but are somehow limited in applying it to the job either by the manager or other group members in a team members are encouraged to continually develop skills and apply what they learn on the job  conflict resolution in a group if members find themselves in conflict situations they do not know how to deal with it their supervisorleader may postpone intervention until serious damage is done ie a crisis situation in a team members realize that conflict is a normal aspect of human interaction but they view such situations as an opportunity for new ideas and creativity they try to manage conflict quickly and constructively  participative decision making in a group members may or may not participate in decisions affecting the team conformity often appears more important than positive results in a team members participate in decisions affecting the team but understand their leader must make a final verdict whenever the team cannot decide or an emergency exists positive winwin results are the goal at all times  clear leadership in a group members tend to work in an unstructured environment with undetermined standards of performance in a team members work in a structured environment they know what boundaries exist and who has final authority the leader sets agreed high standards of performance and heshe is respected via active willing participation  commitment in a group members are uncommitted towards excellence and personal pride performance levels tend to be average staff turnover is high because talented individuals quickly recognize that a personal expectations are not being fulfilled  b they are not learning and growing from others and c they are not working with the best people in a team only those committed to excellence are hired everyone works together in a harmonious environment why people join groups or work teams people naturally tend to join groups being usually surrounded by others with comparable values this fact reinforce their own value system another reason to join groups might be that groups give people an informal status which can be the feeling of belonging to a distinct unit group membership also provides a level of individual security members feel that they are equal with the others individuals are better listened within a group recognition participation and communication needs are higher satisfied in a group to conclude specific needs of group members are better met in a group than in the whole organization the literature describes several types of groups according to a set of criteria formal groups work team is created by an organization in order to achieve a certain goal being recognized and receiving full support from the organization under this category several forms of groups may exist functional group – consisting of a manager and all its subordinates in a formal organization each department may be considered a functional group operational or taskdedicated group – specially created to achieve a clear task has a temporary basis and the group is suspended once the task is finished permanent committee – it is actually an operational committee having the responsibility to solve problems that appear periodically in a certain field of activity a committee is not specific only to an organization there are also interorganizational committees for instance interministerial committees consultative group – a temporary group having as main task to make recommendations for a certain topic usually includes persons from different sectors selfmanaged group – it represents the group that has to achieve a certain task without being regularly monitored its members have full responsibility being governed by a spirit of solidarity they make their own decision on the distribution of tasks inside the group they establish the working hours and they are doing the performance selfevaluation project teams – nowadays projects often require that people work together in order to accomplish the project goal members of these teams might belong to different groups but receive clear assignment to activities for the same project thereby outsiders may view them as a single unit informal groups arise from natural attractions among individuals for social reinforcement or other benefits they seldom share the organizational objectives and have a temporary basis this type of group is created by people and not by organizations informal groups are not formally recognized by the organization and do not represent a unit in the organizational chart  there are several types of informal groups group of interests – created usually to facilitate the achievement of group goals group of friends – created most frequently to satisfy the social needs of its members group of support – members are supporting each other to meet common needs virtual group – it’s the most modern type facilitated by the computer and internet connection this is a group of people who work interdependently and with shared purpose across space time and organization boundaries using technology to communicate and collaborate virtual team members can be located across a country or across the world rarely meet facetoface and include members from different cultures  when a group in an organizational context embarks upon a process of selfassessment in order to estimate its own effectiveness and thereby improve performance it can be argued that it is engaging in team building process the process of team building includes • clarifying the goal and building ownership across the team and • identifying the inhibitors to teamwork and removing or overcoming them to selfassessment meant that a team is trying to find out both • its current strengths as a team • its current weakness roles within a team belbins book management teams  presents the conclusions from his work studying how the members of teams interacted during business games run at henley management college one of his key conclusions was that an effective team should have members that cover nine key roles in managing the team based on belbins model of nine team roles managers of organizations that are building working teams would be advised to ensure that each of the roles can be performed by a team member some roles are compatible and can be more easily carried out by the same person some are less compatible and are more likely to be done well by people with different skills the roles actually represent tasks and functions in the selfmanagement of the teams activities belbin developed a test to identify individual team roles this test is presented as exercise  in this way the students can evaluate their own skills in fulfilling belbin’s roles the nine roles described by belbin are  cocoordinator the cocoordinator ensures that all members of the team are able to contribute to discussions and decisions of the team their concern is for fairness and equity among team members those who want to make decisions quickly or unilaterally may feel frustrated by their insistence on consulting with all members but this can often improve the quality of decisions made by the team   shaper the shaper is full of drive to make things happen and get things going a dynamic teammember who loves a challenge and thrives on pressure in doing this they are quite happy to push their own views forward do not mind being challenged and are always ready to challenge others the shaper looks for the pattern in discussions and tries to pull things together into something feasible which the team can then get to work on this member possesses the drive and courage required to overcome obstacles  plant this member is the one who is most likely to come out with original ideas and challenge the traditional way of thinking about things sometimes they become so imaginative and creative that the team cannot see the relevance of what they are saying however without the plant to scatter the seeds of new ideas the team will often find it difficult to make any progress the plant’s strength resides in providing major new insights and ideas for changes in direction and not in contributing to the detail of what needs to be done although they sometimes situate themselves far from the other team members they always come back to present their brilliant idea  resource investigator the resource investigator is the group member with the strongest contacts and networks and is excellent at bringing in information and support from the outside whatever the team needs the resource investigator is likely to have someone in their address book that can either provide it or know someone else who can provide it this member can be very enthusiastic in pursuit of the team’s goals but cannot always sustain this enthusiasm being highly driven to make connections with people the resource investigator may appear to be flighty and inconstant but their ability to call on their connections is highly useful to the team  implementer the individual who is a company worker is well organized and effective at turning big ideas into manageable tasks and plans that can be achieved the implementer is the practical thinker who can create systems and processes that will produce what the team wants such individuals are both logical and disciplined in their approach they are hardworking and methodical but may have some difficulty in being flexible being strongly rooted in the real world they may frustrate other team members by their perceived lack of enthusiasm for inspiring visions and radical thinking but their ability to turn those radical ideas into workable solutions is important  team worker the team worker is the one who is most aware of the others in the team their needs and their concerns he is concerned to ensure that interpersonal relationships within the team are maintained they are sensitive and supportive of other people’s efforts and try to promote harmony and reduce conflict they may be the first to approach another team member who feels slighted excluded or otherwise attacked but has not expressed their discomfort team workers are particularly important when the team is experiencing a stressful or difficult period the team workers concern with people factors can frustrate those who are keen to move quickly but their skills ensure longterm cohesion within the team  completer finisher  as the name suggests the completer finisher is the one who drives the deadlines and makes sure they are achieved they usually communicate a sense of urgency which push other team members into action they are conscientious and effective at checking the details completer finisher has a great eye for spotting flaws and gaps and for knowing exactly where the team is in relation to its schedule team members who have less preference for detail work may be frustrated by their analytical and meticulous approach but the work of the completer finisher ensures the quality and timeliness of the output of the team  monitor evaluator a sober a strategic and discerning member tries to see all options and judge them accurately they have a strategic perspective and can judge situations accurately the monitor evaluator can be overcritical and is not usually good at inspiring and encouraging others however this member contributes a measured and dispassionate analysis and through objectivity stops the team committing itself to a misguided task  specialist this person provides specialist skills and knowledge and has a dedicated and singleminded approach they can adopt a very narrow perspective and sometimes fail to see the whole picture group development process many teams go through a lifecycle of stages firstly identified by bruce tuckman in  as forming storming norming and performing this model has become the basis for further models of group development principally adding the th phase of adjourning forming the process of team formation calls for the individuals to come together during this phase group members are exploring new relationships and receiving new responsibilities the team meets and learns about the opportunity and challenges and then agrees on goals and begins to tackle the tasks team members tend to behave quite independently they may be motivated but are usually relatively uninformed of the issues and objectives of the team team members are more likely to be characterized by formality politeness silence and tentative interactions mature team members begin to model appropriate behaviour even at this early phase sharing the knowledge of the concept of teams  forming storming norming performing is extremely helpful to the team supervisors of the team tend to need to be directive during this phase the forming stage is important because in this stage the members get to know each other and make new friends this is also a good opportunity to see how each member of the team works as an individual and how they respond to pressure storming due to the fact that the group members become more and more comfortable with the idea of belonging to a certain group they start to identify their own place within the group they want to start influencing the group norms roles eg leadership and procedures  in this stage different ideas compete for consideration the team addresses issues such as what problems they are really supposed to solve how they will function independently and together and what leadership model they will accept team members open up to each other and confront each others ideas and perspectives in most of the cases storming can be resolved rather quickly however there are cases when the team never leaves this stage the wisdom of some team members usually determines the end of this stage immature team members will begin the “show” to demonstrate how much they know and convince others that their ideas are the best the storming stage is necessary to the growth of the team it can be controversial unpleasant and even painful to members of the team who are against the conflict without tolerance and patience the team will fail this phase can become destructive to the team and will lower motivation if allowed to get out of control during this phase supervisors of the team may be more accessible but tend to still need to be directive in their guidance of decisionmaking and professional behaviour norming the group becomes more cohesive during this phase because they begin to recognize and respect each other contribution team members start to adjust their behaviour to the others as they develop work habits that make teamwork seem more natural team members often work by agreeing on rules values professional behaviour shared methods and working tools during this phase team members begin to trust each other motivation increases as the team gets more acquainted with the project two categories of norms develop within the team behavioural and performance behavioural ones establish how a person is expected to act and relate to the others these norms are developed by the group in order to allow conflict resolution to determine expectations for groupthink or to allow divergent thinking and to identify conformity expectations eg be on time talk in turn etc performance norms are those expectations that are requested by the group from each individual and may include expected contributions to the work both types of norms are set to facilitate group process problem solving and decision making teams in this phase may lose their creativity if the norming behaviours become too strong supervisors of the team during this phase tend to be participative more than in the earlier stages the team members can be expected to take more responsibility for making decisions and for their professional behaviour performing once the rules were established and recognized the group can concentrate on the tasks the highperforming teams are able to function as a unit as they find ways to get the job done smoothly and effectively without inappropriate conflict or the need for external supervision team members have become interdependent by this time they are motivated and knowledgeable the team members are now competent autonomous and able to handle the decisionmaking process without supervision the  focus of the group should be now on results rather than on process even if work plan revisions might be necessary supervisors of the team during this phase are almost always participative the team will make most of the necessary decisions nevertheless a change in leadership may cause the team to revert to storming as the new people challenge the existing norms and dynamics of the team adjourning once the tasks for which the group was formed is accomplished the group can adjourn it is important to arrange during this phase a formal recognition of the task completed this might motivate people to embark other tasks andor groups advantages versus disadvantages of the teamworking if there are many advantages of the teamworking there are also disadvantages that should be considered by a manager when building a team generally a team can better find the best solutions for a complex task than an individual or even a small group of people grouping the individual judgments increases the chance of success in solving a problem due to a higher degree of objectivity and to elimination of individual errors a definite benefit of working in teams is the positive synergy meaning that the results achieved by the team are better than the sum of individual results however there are also obstacles that might be encountered during the process of teamworking some of the most common are different organizational practice when members are coming from different organizations socioeconomic inequalities between the members age gender statute team objective unclear stated etc the literature is describing the main dysfunctions of a team   absence of trust this dysfunction stems from teams unwillingness to be vulnerable team members who are not genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses make it impossible to build a foundation for trust  fear of conflict this failure to build trust is dangerous because it sets a brick for the second dysfunction fear of conflict teams that lack trust are not able to engage in vivid debate of ideas instead they resort to roundabout discussions and guarded comments  lack of commitment a lack of healthy conflict might be a problem because it induces the third dysfunction of a team lack of commitment without having expressed their opinions in the course of passionate and open debate team members rarely if ever commit to decisions though they may simulate agreement during meetings avoidance of accountability because of this lack of real commitment team members develop an avoidance of accountability the fourth dysfunction without committing to a clear plan of action  even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviours that seem counterproductive to the good of the team inattention to results failure to hold one another accountable creates an environment where the fifth dysfunction can thrive inattention results occurs when team members put their individual needs such as ego career development or recognition or even the needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team there are several factors that can influence the effectiveness of a team among them some are worthy to be mentioned − organizational environment – may shape the way of interacting both between team members themselves and between the team and the rest of the organization − the nature of the task – may influence the way of action as well as the focus of team efforts the more complex the task is the interactions with external environment are more intense and focused − team size – there is not a magic number for a team to be effective it was noticed that increasing the number of members may lead in the first stage to a higher performance nevertheless a continuous increasing of the number of members may lead to the limitation of the team performance or even to a decreased performance examples of successful teams sports offer some of the best examples of teamwork for example a football running back and quarterback’s ability are totally dependent on the strength of their offensive line a basketball player’s ability in scoring is mainly dependent on his team’s willingness to pass students that succeed in group efforts understand that they must do team projects rather than group projects there are subtle but very important differences between group and team projects a team project is when members of the teamwork work interdependently towards the same goal it is also a team project when every member in the group feels a sense of ownership of their role in a group project members work independently and are often not working towards the same goal the members in the group also focus a lot on themselves because they are not involved in the planning of their goals teamwork has also become increasingly acknowledged as an essential skill for employees in companies either small or large nowadays increasingly global economy places a premium on teamwork in the work setting teamwork has become so valued that many large corporations have developed specific tests to measure potential employees’ teamwork abilities many companies are even acknowledging this in their job titles by changing the designation of supervisors or managers to “team leader”  exercise task  distribute belbin questionnaire together with the instructions sheet to the students for the selfassessment of the roles they may have in a team instruction sheet how to fillin the questionnaire  the purpose of this questionnaire is to assist you in analyzing the role you may play when you work in a team be honest with yourself without spending too much time on the task mark the answers to that situation which are true for you at present  seven situations appear below sections ag after each of them eight answers are given you are asked to tick the answers that better describe your behaviour under the circumstances provided at the beginning of the section you can tick maximum  answers in each section you can tick only one if this one is the only one describing your behaviour repeat this step for each of the seven sections ag  come back to section a and evaluate the relative importance weight of each of the ticked answers you should distribute  points no more than  for the answers that you ticked in a section  for example if you have ticked answers   and  in section a but you consider that answer  is your predominant behaviour you can give  points for answer  another  points for answer  and finally  points for answer  in total  points if you have ticked only one answer in a section it automatically receives  points  allocate  points for each of the seven sections ag  when you finished step  go to the page containing a summary table  transfer all the points you allocated under each section in the summary table identify your points in the summary table item by item the first row is dedicated for section a considering the example above you should write  in the

shifting from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases and conditions over the next  years global deaths from cancer heart disease and traffic crashes will increase as low and middleincome economies grow according to the new who world health statistics   chronic diseases such as heart disease stroke cancer chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are by far the leading cause of

nurses and midwives have made some – albeit limited – progress in influencing national health policies or in achieving real recognition as members of the health care team it is timely to reflect on past achievements and to develop strategies to ensure that nurses and midwives in the future will be in the positions that enable them to influence health care policy and delivery throughout the region  there is a question how to motivate nurses midwives and nursing students to accept the growth of the public health health promotion the principles of the health for all and to recognize that health for all and health promotion is something essential for nurses there are some useful documents such as the vienna declaration and some others that can help to convince them that nurses should play a key role in achieving health for all the targets health for all give framework in which nurses can achieve their traditional aims in new more independent ways in close collaboration with other health professionals their clients and communities   be more freely and more independent be the part of the successful team are the wishes of everyone so they could be motivators to accept new knowledge and challenges to become a good health promoter historical background of “health for all” strategy in  in alma ata was a conference on primary health care who member states had advocated the development of primary health care as the key strategy for the attainment of health for all primary health care phc is the first level of contact with the national health system for individuals families and the community bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and work  phc includes all services that play a part in health such as income housing education and environment it also includes primary care ie the diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury and it includes the critical elements of health promotion and prevention of illness and injury one of its greatest strengths is citizen participation in needs identification and service delivery and in bringing these services as close to people as possible  the conference in alma ata strongly reaffirms that health which is a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity is a fundamental human right and that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most important worldwide social goal whose realisation requires the action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health sector for health professionals it is important that phc relies at local and referral levels on health workers including physicians nurses midwives auxiliaries and community workers as applicable suitably trained socially and technically to work as a health team and to respond to the expressed health needs of the community  strategy “health for all” and important documents concerning nursing “health for all ” thirtytwo member states of the who european region created in  when they adopted the first set of european targets for health an unprecedented act of solidarity and unity in the health field the policys broad health agenda covers lifestyles the environment and health services addressing all levels of society and reaching out all partners and sectors that can influence health it offers not only a vision of where to go for better health and quality of life but also a map showing how to get there the health policy brought a new philosophy to the health development process in the countries of the region  the strategy focused on four areas of concern • lifestyles and health • risk factors affecting health and the environment • the reorientation of the health care system • the mobilization of political managerial and technological support to bring about these changes   health for all  includes  targets organized in three groups • the first  targets fall into three categories the basic health for all goals the health of vulnerable populations and specific health problems • targets  to  address the changes in lifestyles the improvements in the environment and the developments in prevention treatment and care that will make their achievement possible • targets  –  address the basic needs that must be met to sound health for all development the development of knowledge and information support for policy and action the creation of the requisite managerial infrastructures the development of human resources for health the mobilization of resources for health the mobilization of resources and broad social support and the advocacy and practice of ethical values  “ottawa charter for health promotion” the first international conference on health promotion in  in ottawa gave to world ottawa charter for health promotion which was adopted as a consensus statement it set a new direction for health promotion action the ottawa charter outlines the five overlapping and interactive means of action that constitute a comprehensive strategy for health promotion building healthy public policy creating supportive environments strengthening community action developing personal skills and reorienting health services  “vienna declaration” in vienna was in  the first who european conference on nursing there were represented all member states of the european region the vienna recommendations underline the importance of primary health care and urge that nursing practice has to be based on the principles underpinning health for all the recommendations suggest that nursing practice should focus on • promoting and maintaining health and preventing disease • involving individuals families and communities in care and making it possible for them to take more responsibility for their health • working actively to reduce inequities in access to health care services and to satisfy the needs of whole populations especially the underserved • extending cooperation between disciplines and sectors of society and • ensuring the quality of care and appropriate use of technology  the vienna declaration highlights the importance of promoting the active involvement of the community in setting health goals the focus is shifting away from treating individuals towards building relationships with families and communities and this is reflected in the targets for health for all the targets give framework in which nurses can achieve their traditional aims in new more independent ways in close collaboration with other health professionals their clients and communities  “nursing in europe”  in  was the meeting of who expert committee on nursing practice it stressed that the activities undertaken by nurses in all cultures and societies according to the six categories   managing physical and mental health illness status  monitoring and ensuring the quality of health care practices monitoring and ensuring the quality of health care practices involve such responsibilities as selfmonitoring monitoring the effects of interventions supervising the work of less skilled personal and consulting with others as appropriate  organizing and managing the health care system this category includes setting priorities with individuals and communities to ensure that multiple needs are met obtaining specialist services as necessary coping with staff shortages and maintaining a therapeutic team it also involves promoting intersectoral work in settings community clinics schools  caring and helping caring and helping involve establishing a climate for healing nurses provide comfort to people in distress support in managing symptoms and help in ensuring the maximum participation of individuals families and communities in health care planning treatment and care giving  teaching about health teaching about health is an important function of nursing nurses should teach selfcare and guide people in caring for their family members  nurses must be able to deal with emergencies and crises through the appropriate allocation of resources to meet rapidly changing demands the key concept for the future development of nursing is the need to create a nursing role that is appropriate to peoples health needs rather the needs of the health system  “health ” the new strategy health  – health for all in the st century was accepted in  it has the following main elements  the constant goal is to achieve full health potential for all there are two main aims • to promote and protect peoples health throughout their lives and • to reduce the incidence of the main diseases and injuries and alleviate the suffering they cause  three basic values form the ethical foundation of health  • health as a fundamental human right • equity in health and solidarity between and within all countries and their inhabitants and • participation and accountability of individuals groups institutions and communities for continued health development  four main strategies for action have been chosen to ensure that scientific economic social and political sustainability drive the implementation of health  multisectoral strategies healthoutcomedriven programmes and investments for health development and clinical care integrated family– and community  oriented primary health care supported by a flexible and responsive hospital system and a participatory health development process  since the first who ministerial conference held in vienna over ten years before little progress had been made towards enabling nurses and midwives to contribute more forcefully to meeting peoples needs for health care and public health  “munich declaration” the second who ministerial conference on nursing and midwifery was held in munich in june  there was universal agreement on the need for strengthening nursing and midwifery at all levels of policy development and implementation and a declaration was drafted the munich declaration on nursing and midwifery a force for health underlines the key and increasingly important roles of nurses and midwives urges all relevant authorities to step up actions to strengthen nursing and midwifery and urges acceptance of the need for supportive steps such as workforce planning legislative frameworks and development of professional practice  other important events and documents the st world health assembly set who on a course to tackle longstanding new and looming threats to global public health among its achievements the health assembly endorsed a sixyear action plan to tackle what are the leading threats to human health noncommunicable diseases delegates also requested who  through a resolution  to intensify its work to curb harmful use of alcohol which is the fifth leading risk factor for death and disability in the world  in  who marks  years of service to humanity and  years of affiliation with icn international council of nursing it also marks  years since the goal of universal access to health services through primary health care was enshrined by who and member states in the declaration of alma ata which highlighted the “gross inequality in the health status of the people particularly between developed and developing countries as well as within countries” to address this who focused on phc as the key to attaining the goals of its  strategy health for all by the year  in  primary health care is again high on the global health agenda icn is celebrating nursing’s leadership and advocating for greater nursing involvement in phc the key strategy to achieving universal access and better health for the world’s people  “health for all” strategy and nursing role today today a number of key forces  poverty increased globalization climate change political unrest  affect health and contribute to challenges in service planning and delivery these challenges shape the environments in which nurses are delivering phc and include • the rising costs of health care • increasing consumer expectations and demands • changing demographics and ageing populations  • • • • • • • nursing and other health worker shortages legislation andor political will to fully utilise nursing’s potential social conflict and unrest which destabilise services and constrain resources natural and manmade disasters endemic and pandemic disease as well as new and reemerging ones the surge in chronic diseases making the shift to community based care  nursing practice is the very essence of primary health care their education experience and the settings where they work make it so nurses deliver services wherever people are found in homes schools workplaces prisons health and wellness clinics and other community settings as well as in hospitals and research centres in virtually all countries nurses constitute the largest health care provider group nurses are also critical to the training and supervision of other personnel and to the planning organisation monitoring and evaluation of phc services  conclusion health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over and to improve their health health promotion strategies are not limited to a specific health problem nor to a specific set of behaviours who as a whole applies the principles of and strategies for health promotion to a variety of population groups risk factors diseases and in various settings health promotion and the associated efforts put into education community development policy legislation and regulation are equally valid for prevention of communicable diseases injury and violence and mental problems as they are for prevention of non communicable diseases  while health promotion is basically activity in the health and social fields and not a medical service health professionals – particularly in primary health care – have an important role in nurturing and enabling health promotion  are the health professionals able to promote health do they have knowledge and skills are they motivated to do health education and to advocate the promotion of health and what about nurses are they educated enough to be equal to other health professionals on this field nurses are the principal group of health personnel providing phc they foster and maintain links between individuals families communities and the rest of the health care system working both autonomously and collaboratively to prevent disease and disability and to promote improve maintain and restore health their work encompasses population health health promotion disease prevention wellness care first point of contact care and disease management across the lifespan  who and some nursing organizations have produced statements that describe a vision for nursing  an ideal picture of how it should be for example that who director  general  has provided a view of the role of nurses »not just as active providers of care meeting the professionally defined needs of passive patients but as facilitators who help people to take charge of their own health«  this topic is an attempt to give nurses and other health professionals information and new knowledge and to motivate and prepare them to accept the new role with all challenges exercises task  carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module critically discuss the importance of nursing role in public health and health policy

• know the definition and characteristics of the quality of nursing standards and criteria clinical pathways • be familiar with quality quality in healthcare quality in nursing quality assurance • be familiar with quality assurance according to the norma lang model and standards and criteria in nursing • know how to design nursing standard and clinical pathway the word quality is used every day everywhere in our lives and also in health care professionals work field there are very general definitions which state that quality is a characteristic of things and phenomena and also more precise general and narrow professional definitions with regard to nursing quality many authors cite donabedian who asserts that quality is the harmony between actual nursing and the criteria prescribed beforehand the quality of nursing is the level of excellence quality assurance is merely a process that incorporates the systematic description measurement evaluation and when necessary implementation of measures to improve quality every organization that assumes responsibility for monitoring and promoting the quality of its work chooses a quality assurance programme it is not possible to measure quality of care unless it has been accurately described in measurable terms one of the ways to do this is by setting standards and clinical pathways an introductory lecture gives the students first insight in the quality in nursing and health care the theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study after introductory lectures students first carefully read the recommended readings afterwards they discuss the importance of thinking and doing in excellent way in continuation they need to find published materials eg papers on quality in nursing and health care and present their findings to

zaletel theoretical background about quality definition and description the word quality is used every day everywhere in our lives and also in our field of work the concept of quality is always expressed subjectively we must accept the fact that someone is very satisfied with an individual product or service performed while at the same time someone else may be very dissatisfied judging quality depends on an individuals knowledge and awareness experiences expectations and recognisable standards of quality  more and more nurses in their work with patients often ask whether they are doing enough for them or performing quality nursing several find a positive response quite fast yet such a flat and subjective evaluation is insufficient if nurses want to perform their work truly in a professional manner they must keep raising this question again and again in an endeavour to continually improve the quality of their work and thus contribute to the best of their ability to preserving and improving the health of their patients what is required is also a more professional and organised approach quality is attributed to material production people and characteristics the quality of a product or service can be defined as the relative perfection of all the components of the product or service features with respect to meeting the requirements and justified expectations of buyers or users who use a product during its respective life span from this definition we can see that those who offer a product or service do not have the final word concerning quality the buyer or user of the product or service is the final judge on its quality  while assuring quality of the products material production and quality of service which originates from service activities to which health also belongs certain laws apply to determine the quality of the latter • the service activity does not produce tangible products • the service cannot be made for stockpiling • the service user is usually present in the process of performing services which is a further aspect from the standpoint of quality • in performing a service punctuality speed and correct procedure is even more important • the clients wishes and his standards of quality are harder to specify than in material production the users standards with regard to the quality of services performed are a reflection of the individuals personal criteria  performing a service more or less always includes the behaviour of the person who performs the service and person who uses the service for different services the length  of time when the user and service provider are in contact varies greatly to assess the quality of work many possibilities are available to nurses frequently the satisfaction of patients is mentioned as a standard to determine the quality of nursing although at times the patient and nurse are in touch for a very short time the service user or patient quickly forms his or her opinion on the quality of the service performed people are dissatisfied with the treatment of the nurse not only because of a lack of professionalism of which they are simply incapable of assessing but also because of the attitude and attention which she devotes to an individual patient  the patient evaluates quality primarily according to how the service providers treat him what attitude they had to him how much they fulfilled his expectations or whether the service providers are worthy of trust or he could receive the care he required  quality in nursing quality is very hard to define  which is why we find very general definitions which state that quality is a characteristic of things and phenomena irrespective of quantity and also more precise general and narrow professional definitions the dictionary of the slovene written language defines quality as something that describes things with regard to a large degree of positive characteristics with respect to quality in healthcare ovretveit  created the definition of quality that states that the quality of health activities is the complete satisfaction of the needs of those who are in most need of health services for the lowest organisational costs within the given limit and guidelines of higher administrative bodies and those paying it also mentions the components of quality healthcare • a high level of professionalism • efficient use of resources human financial and material • the lowest possible risk for the patient • patient satisfaction and • a positive influence on his state of health the quality of healthcare attains these demands and in accordance with existing knowledge meets the expectations of the greatest possible utilization with the least possible risk to the patients health and wellbeing  with regard to nursing quality many authors  cite donabedian  who asserts that quality is the harmony between actual nursing and the criteria prescribed beforehand the dictionary of the slovene written language defines criteria as something that serves as the basis for evaluating comparing and judging  a standard  kitson and gienbing  quote williams  definition of quality quality with efficient nursing improves the state of health and satisfaction of inhabitants within the resources that society and individuals are prepared to spend on nursing the quality of nursing is the level of excellence achieved  the quality of nursing can be seen in three dimensions • the quality of working methodology and technology which are labelled with efficiency professionalism expertise safety care and suitability • the quality of employees  mutual relations professionalism that is revealed in  the abilities of employees to respect the patients personality trust independence and equal status passing on appropriate information and • the quality of organisation which is labelled with safety comfort continuity efficiency and the level of equipment  nursing quality takes into account three fundamental dimensions the profession management and users of health services who should be mutually codependent in doing so they establish patient satisfaction as a prime indicator of quality  research performed till now in slovenia was focused chiefly on measuring quality of the medical professions less on measuring the quality of nursing the work of nurses and developing a method to measure patient satisfaction to master these changes in healthcare in the modern way of exceptional importance is an orientation towards the person efficient use of human resources motivation and the development of values for quality with modern leadership and efficient measurement of the work results performance from the aspect of nursing in all healthcare systems  assuring and improving nursing quality quality assurance is merely a process that incorporates the systematic description measurement evaluation and when necessary implementation of measures to improve quality this means the systematic and planned implementation of measures in order to achieve the prescribed requirements for quality  a distinction must be made from among three concepts quality assessment quality assurance and quality improvement  quality assessment quality assessment is a process which by employing comparative methods and selected criteria we can use to compare healthcare services among themselves that have been performed and agreed upon in nursing this means a comparison between the nursing services actually offered and selected and established criteria and standards not until quality has been assessed can a system of quality assurance be formed which assists in improving and attaining the desired goals   quality assurance quality assurance is not a unique final action but a lasting process that demands a constant improvement of the features of products and services   quality improvement quality improvement is a process that follows the phases of quality assessment and quality assurance removes discovered obstacles or problems and raises quality to a higher level  improving quality is a dynamic process with the following principles • discovering and using the best results to achieve excellence • explicitly defining the goals of quality • supervision within the profession • a benevolent leadership and • the inclusion of patients every organisation that assumes responsibility for monitoring and promoting the quality  of its work chooses a quality assurance programme in doing so it is necessary to make a radical change from determining or assessing quality to assuring it the goal of quality assurance in nursing once we choose a quality assurance programme we are endeavouring to achieve the best efficiency and best results with a rational use of available resources in doing so we seek to achieve the following goals • improve and maintain the patients state of health • improve and maintain the patients functional abilities • develop the patients psychophysical condition or wellbeing and • gain the patients satisfaction after nursing has been performed we see the person or patient as a whole holistically which is why these goals must accompany all of the activities that we perform to the benefit of our users among the activities of a nurse one could mention setting standards and criteria of quality in nursing  among the most important conditions for quality nursing is taking into consideration and developing elements of modern nursing for quality assurance in nursing one can use external and internal methods the basic difference is that in the case of external quality assurance the assurance comes from outside from external professionals and institutions quality assurance within health institutions is the task of those who perform nursing which they plan and implement independently and for which they are also responsible  internal quality assurance of nursing can be performed whether centralised or decentralised the characteristics of central quality assurance are • the precise analysis of all nursing activities • use of instruments that are scientifically based and practical for nursing • quality assurance executed by a group of experts trained for that purpose and • nursing teams that perform nursing have no insight into it the characteristics of decentralised quality assurance are the following • observation of the nursing performed • the instrument of observation is not firmly specified being selected with regard to which nursing emergency is observed • it is performed at the level of the hospital unit  department • it is performed by members of the nursing team who work in the unit and • members of the nursing team have a direct insight into nursing quality assurance  according to ishikawa  the quality assurance programme includes the following sequential phases  • planning goals and methods to achieve them • performing education and improvement • verifying determining mistakes and their causes • taking measures and removing mistakes  quality assurance in nursing according to the norma lang model in literature one can trace many models to evaluate the quality of nursing most models use as their basis norma langs model from  which has seven levels worldwide many model modifications have originated eg the model of the american nurses’ association which has eight levels or the royal australian nursing federation with eleven models the norma lang model has seven levels that run through three phases figure  ipt ion identify values identify standards and criteria de sc r take action choose action n tio ac me as ur em en t possible routes of change methodology and comparison with practice analysis of results figure  the norma lang model of quality assurance  description in the first phase  description  we identify the values and attitudes that lead us to nursing then we select criteria for excellent nursing in standards covering the structure process and outcome  measurement in the second phase  measurement  we choose the methodology that is used to determine what our practice is like in comparison with standards and criteria of excellent very good nursing which we have set internally or were set externally the results obtained are analysed and then we decide if and why we need changes the authoress of this model recommends the inclusion of socalled swot factors strengths weaknesses opportunities threats  or hazards and traps in the analysis  action in the third phase  action  we choose the changes and paths along which the  changes will run in our environment and finally introduce the changes in our routine work  the circle then runs further through all phases because quality assurance is a continuous process the first step in this circle of introducing changes is made when nurses decide to inscribe the philosophy of nursing departments clinics and hospitals in order to be successful in doing so they must speak about personal values common values the basic values of our profession attitudes in connection with nursing patients ethical issues the holistic and the individual approach to the patient uniqueness and singularity of the individual and basic human rights these views and attitudes can be written in brief the next action is to define the purpose  what we are seeking to achieve with quality assurance in nursing in order to assess quality we must be able to describe and present what we are doing to this standards and criteria have to be produced to measure or assess quality besides swot analyses we can use many other tools or methods that can be found in literature here we perform a comparison between what is done with what must be done we determine what needs to be done changed in order to achieve what is desired and introduce certain changes once we find a low level of quality  maybe standards are not observed or are unsuitable  then we plan specific activities to alter practice and the circle begins again nursing standards standards are important elements of quality assurance and at the same time elements of contemporary nursing according to donabedian  standards are professionally designed specific quantitative requirements that define something good with respect to nursing standards in the nursing profession itself one often uses elizabeth masons definition  which states that a nursing standard is a valid definition of nursing quality and includes criteria which can be used to assess efficiency  quality is assured only by those standards that are valid a standard is invalid if it does not contain criteria to assess nursing the definition of criteria can be taken from the dictionary of the slovene written language  as something that serves as the basis for evaluation comparison or judgement  a standard standards are established at the level of • the profession  these are general standards vital for the nursing profession in the broadest sense • field of work hospital homes for the elderly health centre and • specialist  local level clinic hospital wing health centre service aim and applicability of standards nursing standards specify nursing practice and represent the content of excellent  very good nursing they show what kind of resources are necessary structure what should be done procedure and what benefits the patient has result from good nursing the purpose of standardisation in nursing is • to provide a standard term of the profession in an institution in the broader social environment • assistance in evaluating nursing • higher quality of nursing • a standard basis for teaching and practical work with pupils and students • aid in planning implementing and evaluating nursing and seeking improvements • assist in determining staffing requirements work allocation and raise job satisfaction and • give an insight into the process quality and results of nursing  characteristics of standards these must reflect the aspects of modern nursing the latest research findings supported by practical experience professional training and powers and responsibilities of members of the nursing team at the same time they must express the specific nature of an individual field of nursing standards also define the conditions to perform nursing and the anticipated results  standards contain criteria that permit us to evaluate them the criteria must be measurable specific comparable comprehensible clear and uptodate standards of the structure refer to circumstances in which nursing is to be performed this is revealed in organisation education and the qualification structure aids and equipment these are sources input to perform good excellent nursing standards of the process define the quality of performing nursing we specify what has to be done for the good of the patient and when and how often with the aim of achieving the greatest impact on changing or maintaining the patients state of health functional abilities and psychophysical condition in this process sources are used for the purpose of achieving the best effects  excellent nursing within process standards we can form content standard  for health education and therapeutic communication we specify what to teach or what to advice standards of the outcome define the anticipated changes in the patient and his environment after performing nursing the quality of nursing is seen both in the positive results and in the absence of possible negative results in the outcome we see the actual achievements output types of standards standards are classified in four groups being structure standards process standards outcome standards and content standards  structure standards • structure standards answer a questions • where it will be done • with what materials and aids • which organisational model is the most suitable   process standards process standards answer questions • what will be done which action or intervention • when and • how often it is necessary to perform an individual action or intervention  outcome standards outcome standards answer questions • what kind of result to expect as the achievement of the nursing performed • when we can expect the result • how this result is recognised  content standards content standard answer a question • what will be taught the answers to these questions give the criteria of structure process and result standards levels of quality in nursing care standards are means for quality assurance in nursing despite the standards already made in every case of nursing they have not been produced to the highest level of quality we are familiar with the threetier system of quality in nursing  level  acceptable nursing  minimum standards all patients are cared for according to a routine plan  level  comparatively good  optimum standards nursing is planned but the patient is not directly involved in planning and assessment  level   excellent  very good nursing  maximum standards nursing is planned and assessed together with the patient and his relatives the patient is an equal partner in the nursing process nursing that cannot be placed at any level is unacceptable  poor nursing  level   characteristics of good standards the features that are characteristic for good standards are shown with the aid of the acronym rumba which means • r  relevant  real and appropriate with regard to − universal standards − the unit which is being standardised − intervention which is being standardised − the group of patients and − abilities and responsibilities of the nurse • u  understandable for − nurses who perform and evaluate nursing and − students and pupils  • m  measurable  which is achieved by designing clear criteria in − structures − a procedure oriented to the nurse and − the result

healthcare comprises measures and activities that are performed according to medical doctrine and employing medical technology by medical staff and colleagues in protecting health preventing disease discovering diseases and curinghealing diseased and injured people this is performed at the primary secondary and tertiary level primary healthcare is the comprehensive action of all elements of the community for the health of its inhabitants the common goal of all these endeavours is to achieve a level of health of people that would permit them to live a socially and economically productive life even in the transition to a new millennium health remains the highest value and is an important factor in the strategy of the world health organisations health  the health for all for the st century for the european region strategy  in realising this new strategy for europe nursing staff play an important role predominantly in the field of primary healthcare an integral part of this involves basic health activities where besides other tasks prescribed by legislation governing these they perform nursing care and health education in healthcare services for individual groups of inhabitants as well as community visits nursing care and the treatment and rehabilitation of patients at home nursing care nursing care is a fundamental component of healthcare as a comprehensive system it is a professional discipline that is enhanced by other health disciplines it can be broadly defined as care for the health of the whole population an activity whose task is to assist the individual family and community in all states of health and disease the nurse assists both healthy and diseased people in those tasks that contribute to preserving and returning health or a peaceful death and perform them independently if they have the will strength and knowledge to do so in this field the nurse is an expert and has the right to take the initiative and gain supervision the nurse takes part in implementing the plan involving diagnosis and therapy initiated by the physician she is a member of a broader health team in which she collaborates in planning and implementing the whole healthcare process nursing care definition according to the definition of the world health organisation nursing care is a comprehensive activity that is involved with the individual family and social community and with their extensive functions in a time of health and sickness   nursing care goal and mission the goal of nursing care is to enable the patient to be independent if he or she has the necessary strength will and knowledge for this its tasks must be set so that the patient is given back independence in the shortest possible time the mission of nursing care is defined as assistance for the individual family and group in order to fulfil their physical mental psychological spiritual and social potential in the environment where they live and work nursing care also includes planning and implementing nursing activities between illness and rehabilitation and comprises physical mental psychological and social aspects of life as factors of health disease disablement and death it provides care in all periods of the life cycle  from conception to death conventional and contemporary nursing the essential difference between conventional and contemporary nursing is to be sought in its elements philosophy education a nursing process nursing diagnoses theoretical models of nursing care pertaining standards and documentation organisation management staffing professional terminology research legislation etc the philosophy of nursing care cannot be transferred from other social and cultural spheres but must develop in a given environment knowledge is a prerequisite for the development of the profession which is acquired in the process of formal and informal education and conveyed in practice nursing process the nursing process which dictates the working method of nurses in the modern nursing profession contributes to the high level of organisation and a systematic comprehensive and individual approach this is a progressive method of ascertaining the nursing requirements of subjects ie the patient family and community it actively integrates all nursing subjects and members of welfare and health teams systematic work leads to critical judgement and sensible and planned nursing care it operates in four phases which in practice can run in parallel or simultaneously assessment planning performance and evaluation  theoretical nursing models permit nurses to develop nursing components in all areas of its operation they represent the elements of independent and separate action by the nurse  creating nursing standards and nursing diagnosis together with prescribed nursing documentation contributes to the establishment of procedural working methods and consequently the prominent position of nursing care in society  documentation ensures continuity gives the basis for assessing nursing emergencies that have already been performed and is an integral part of safe and efficient nursing care without modern organisation independent management and staffing in nursing care one cannot speak of a modern and independent profession  developing professional terminology allows a uniform understanding of expert terminology that is used in professional literature as in the everyday consensus between members of the nursing and medical teams research into nursing is essential for the development of the profession and to raise it from  the occupational to the professional level duties responsibilities and competence must be defined by legislation  community healthcare community healthcare is defined as a special form of healthcare that deals with active health and social security of the individual family and community due to their biological characteristics specific ailments or being unaccustomed to a new environment they are sensitive to its harmful influences  community healthcare is organised as an independent service or organisational units of primary healthcare in health centres community nursing care community nursing care forms an integral part of primary nursing care and therefore primary healthcare it is performed in the patients home health centre local community and inthefield the community nurse who is a member of the nursing and health team operates at all levels of health education primary secondary and tertiary and promotes the health of the individual family and whole population health education and health promotion health education is a permanent process that accompanies a person from conception through pregnancy birth the period of childhood and adolescence to adulthood and old age for each period there is a specific need for knowledge the community nurse must monitor and adapt to the needs and circumstances or state of the individual family group or community and satisfactorily meet their needs while working together with them  health education at the primary level refers to the treatment that strengthens health thereby preventing illness it is intended for a healthy population the healthy individual and his family and seeks to achieve a higher level of health awareness and interest or motivation in this field as well as responsibility to ones own health  health education at the secondary level is intended for threatened groups and individuals it delineates risk signs of illness disease and treatment participants are trained in selfobservation and selfhelp as well as providing assistance to others with advice or alternative action threatened groups or individuals are therefore ready to take appropriate action discover early signs of anomalies and thus contribute towards an early diagnosis which results in swifter and more successful treatment and the earliest possible return to ones original state of health  health education at the tertiary level is connected with the prevention of the return of illness and a reduction of possible consequential ailments it is intended for patients invalids and their relatives and involves measures to reduce or abolish longterm injuries or incapacity reduce suffering and improve the patients adaptability  under the term of health promotion one comprehends the preservation and strengthening of health which has a much broader objective than primary  preventive care this is a process that involves training people to monitor and improve their own health by themselves it embraces all inhabitants is directed towards an active lifestyle and includes imparting a certain way of life moreover it also involves designing a social and economic environment and personality factors that are useful to health  by promoting health the community nurse encourages people to place health in the highest position on the scale of human values actively provide for it and have the greatest influence on the economic and social impact on it it includes all areas of health promotion preventive care work in the local community organisation environmental protection public health policy and areas of the economy legislation and education goals of community nursing care the community nurse with her colleagues endeavours to achieve and increase positive health of the individual family and community and reduce or prevent negative health the goals of community nursing care are • physical mental spiritual and social health and wellbeing in the social and environmental context • preserved and improved health • a healthy lifestyle • a healthy improved environment • increased human potential for selfhelp and neighbourly assistance • decreased burden of illness • prevented or reduced consequences of illness and risk factors and • recognisable human physical mental spiritual cultural and social needs during a time of health and illness human incapacity and dying fields of work in community nursing care in the entire process of community nursing care the individual his or her family and community is the subject of treatment the individual and members of the narrower and broader community are informed about everything ready for active cooperation and have faith in the work of the community nurse the fields of work in community healthcare are • the health and social treatment of the individual family and community • nursing care of woman in childbed and newborns at home and • nursing care of patients at home subjects in community nursing care in practice community healthcare is of paramount importance for a healthy or sickinjured individual his or her family and community they are treated in an environment where they live learn play and work nevertheless whether the beneficiary of nursing care is an individual family or community a uniform methodological approach or a procedural working method is employed  the individual the community nurse treats individuals from the following groups of inhabitants women woman in childbed women in labour women in the  fertile period and in menopause children newborns infants young and preschool children elementary and high school children adult patients employees patients who have chronic incurable diseases inhabitants of large cities and industrial centres invalids senior citizens and socially deprived groups refugees romas the homeless the community nurse uses an individual and comprehensive approach that includes physical mental spiritual and social aspects together with the individual whether healthy or ill the community nurse determines what the individual and important others can do for each other by themselves the activities of the community nurse are directed to studying and seeking ways to establish uptodate knowledge on health within the context of efforts to lead a healthy life and strengthen and improve health a good state of health of the individual is a prerequisite for social economic and personal development and a decisive component for a quality life the most common concept employed is that of the working elements philosophy of community nursing care scope and working method in the nursing models of virginia henderson and dorothee e orem  they are both oriented to developing responsibility for ones own health and to supporting risk groups of inhabitants the henderson model of nursing defines fourteen basic living activities orems model is based on the level of selfcare selfhelp of the individual family and members of the community the community nurse must assess in an individual each basic living activity and on the basis of the determined condition plan implement and evaluate the achieved state she must also assess the level of selfcare and health education the individual himself as well as the broader social community is responsible for preserving and enhancing his health  the family the family plays a vital role to ensure the health and quality of life of the individual and society the family comes into being once the partners begin to discuss having a common life together with their network of relatives the family represents a specific social and cultural institution in which social bonds and individual freedom are connected in a special way with regard to the definition of this concept the family can be considered as • a primary group  the cradle of human nature in which as the result of intimate association and personal contacts one acquires the first social and personal experiences • a social group in which relations between individuals are deep and continuously linked individuals in this relationship experience fullness and contentment relationships of communities by blood are labelled as original and natural and • a social institution that fulfils important social goals sexual satisfaction reproduction educating children and maintaining emotional ties like each social institution the family has material wealth cultural symbols and recognisable values the community nurse encounters different forms of family core extended and singleparent as well as families in various periods of development thus one can distinguish between the periods of newlymarrieds birth of the first  child a family with schoolchildren and adolescents creation of a new family empty home once the children have left and an old family the community nurse must be acquainted with • the characteristics of individual periods of development the most common health problems and social and material conditions as well as • maslovs hierarchical scale of needs adapted to the family − basics needs for survival and physiological ones state of health and health education of family members as well as conditions of hygiene − safety and protection living conditions and economic standard − love disposition and sense of belonging communication in the family and with the broader environment − respect relations between family members and with the broader environment and − selffulfilment education and employment of family members using this data the community nurse determines together with the family members the position in the family plans and implements nursing care and establishes values this is important to maintain the dynamic equilibrium in the family and ensure a high quality of life for it many people live in communities that are not ranked among the abovementioned families yet the functions they perform are the same in these groups the problems which they meet and ways of solving them are similar to those in conventional families that is why the community nurse treats as a family all those groups who think they are indeed a family  the community nurses have long treated the community as a subject or customer despite the relatively large emphasis the concept of community as customer is not suitably defined for this reason it neglects nursing care in the field of the community as customer nursing care is intended to assist a community in determining expressing and successfully solving problems associated with health the health of a community means meeting common needs by determining problems and managing reciprocal effects within the community as well as between the community and broader society this demands devotion efficient communication a presence and settlement of conflicts collaboration solving relations with the broader society and mechanisms to ensure interaction among the participants and adopt decisions the health of a community means the joint achievement at the highest level of physical mental and social health which corresponds to the knowledge and resources attainable  the activities of a community nurse in a community are preventive at the primary secondary and tertiary level the first two incorporate the promotion preservation and strengthening of the communitys health disease prevention and risk factors extending life and raising the quality of life the working characteristics of a community nurse in the community are • orientation to the group • promotion of health  • preventive care before curative • interdisciplinary and intersector operation • support for an active role of the individual and important others in the nursing process • a holistic approach • continuous nursing and observation of the principle of organisation and • management while respecting ethical principles teamwork in community healthcare in community healthcare teamwork is indispensable the community nurse works together with the nursing and health team teamwork is defined as the work of a group of people in which each individual contributes his or her professional knowledge and is responsible for his or her work which is directed towards a common goal an important role is played by the team leader who plans organises and coordinates work the behaviour of the team members their motivation and level of association depend on the method of leadership the team members communicate among themselves and work interactively the team in basic healthcare consists of health staff and other professionals with whom they first join together members of the nursing team in community healthcare are nurses with college and higher level professional qualifications specialists in community nursing care and health technicians who are integrated in performing nursing care of the patient at home the health team includes specialist physicians nurses from healthcare services covering various individual groups of citizens dispensaries as well as the community nurse and health technician on the basis of the assessed health and social circumstances condition or problems of an individual family group or community other experts are involved physiotherapists occupation therapists hospital psychologists social workers and others the aim of teamwork is to provide nursing care or healthcare for the individual family group or community whose goal is to achieve optimum health the paths and directions of communication of nursing team members are many as the nursing team must collaborate with members among themselves patients and their family members or relatives members of the health team important others neighbours and friends and other services in health centres clinics and outside of these institutions nursing team members solve complex unique and unrepeatable problems of the individual family group or community the model of primary nursing care which is developing in community healthcare permits an ongoing and coordinated process it provides a holistic team approach while respecting the needs benefits and will of subjects and their active role a prerequisite for this is an efficient information communications system which is also computer supported and the good operation of all services  case study community and dispensary nursing care in slovenia regulation of nursing care in slovenia community and dispensary nursing is relatively well regulated as such it is regulated by several legal documents two of the being of utmost importance  health care and health insurance act we should start by one of the most important legal acts – the health care and health insurance act in slovene “zakon o zdravstvenem varstvu in zdravstvenem zavarovanju”  which was adopted in  according to this

preventive healthcare of individual groups of inhabitants and patients treated in community care  community nursing care the community nurse plans performs and evaluates nursing care of the individual family and community in a state of health and wellbeing and in a state of illness injury incapacity distress and undesirable conditions the health and social treatment of the individual family and community as well as nursing care of women in childbed and newborns at home is ranked as preventive whereas nursing care of the patient at home is regarded as curative treatment preventive community nursing care preventive community healthcare comprises the following  • eight community visits to a newborn or infant of up to  year of age and two further visits to blind and disabled mothers • one community visit to a child who is  or  years old • two community visits per year to persons who are blind or who have poor eyesight with other disturbances and who are  to  years old if they are cared

reports on given tasks seminar paper and oral examination through defending results of given tasks  human development and health practice želimir jakšić theoretical background the world is changing in traditional way of thinking by redistribution of political power and economic development scientific advancement and technical possibilities but recently it is recognized that social relations culture and ways of communication human and social capital have a distinct role learning and use of existing knowledge should be part of solution there is not a simple and safe way to solution but we have to simplify and first define what one would like to achieve based on our estimate of needs and available resources development was during s used to describe the process of economic growth and changing in economic structure e g division of labour industrialization increase in per capita national income and that predominant understanding may be traced even now in utilitarian approach to relations of economics and health however the adverse results of social inequities after abrupt introduction of neoliberal economies human costs of structural adjustment programmes weakening of social networks “social capital” and growth of social evils crime corruption insecurity violence wars in spite of apparent economic growth at the beginning of s resulted in reviving the philosophical political and socioeconomic expectations of the better future for humanity human development concept was introduced mahbub ul haq human development report  as idea of advancement of the richness of human life human development index hdi was designed as a measure combining life expectancy education and income the broader approach to human development was underlined importance of human capabilities and freedoms “enabling them to live a longer and health life have access to knowledge and a decent standard of living and participate in the life of their communities and decision affecting their lives” a sen development as freedom oxford university press  in this way human development shares common vision with human rights because in both of them freedom is essential and the basis of selfrespect and dignity of all people the importance on economic inequity poverty deprivation illiteracy and injustice as breaks in the process of development are recognized culture and knowledge innovations and human creativity became important stimulants of progress besides economic incentives human resources management human resources are gradually placed in centre of interest particularly in health care provision however major changes emerged during the last decades • human resources management developed from previous personnel administration and manpower planning and development activities even the titles explain the character of change at present a new slogan indicates further steps “working together in teams and with patients” administration  disciplined and clear formal regulations control and accounting of resources frequently with bureaucratic tendency is superseded by management with priority in better resource utilization decentralized decisions related to health care implementation and followed now by entrepreneurship creating new opportunities innovation orientation toward the future result orientation and risk taking in resource mobilization and allocation • another direction of change is from “scientific management” to “human relations” to “human capital” and “ethical leadership” in case of motivation for work it is another intended change from stimulation by money and incentives to encouragement by recognition of achievements and relying on responsibility table  simplified presentation of dominant approaches to management of people at work “scientific management” taylor  “human relations” mayo  people do not like to work they work only for money simplify tasks and strictly control performance develop standards and regulations people like to feel important but under supervision discuss plans and listen to complaints expected development of selfcontrol “human resources” olsen et al people like to contribute to common purpose fully develop participation in plans and decision motivation will grow through participation “leadership based on principles” covey et al  people are responsible when accepted and free leadership has to be honest based on ethical principles satisfaction at work will enhance quality of work “knowledge society” the xxist century is meant to have several essential problems to solve unequal progress in different countries and in depreciated groups and individuals in countries growing environmental problems including shortages of water and energy ageing of population double burden of health risks as result of epidemiology in transition social and cultural changes in an global postindustrial and information world with not yet known health and social consequences for this entire problem starting with economy the solution is found out in creative production and use of knowledge the problem is how the knowledge is understood and how it could be measured is it factual knowledge an objective truth or proper knowledge presenting individual or group ideology do we need scientific knowledge or wisdom is heart of the problem recognising true or false results or application of what we know both factual and from experience today dominate measures of rigorous but formal criteria academic or administrative competitive comparisons more about production then about use and utilization of knowledge as p liessman critically observed the concept of knowledge society was transformed into a postulate of informed society “information age” and consequently a necessity of lifelong learning ethics ethics remain the most important frame of human aspects and quality of health care the main traditional human ethics ordered doing well but in the modern times the  dominant rule is doing right this is a deep change at the beginning of st century when most of human values are shaking and uncertain it is not clear which type of rules will prevail the increased gap between those who have material goods and power and those who are poor depreciated and marginalized is producing critical situations in political social and health matters in individuals frequent stress addictions social isolation and suicides in communities diminished solidarity and increased violence in states market orientation uncertainties crisis of democracy bigger mortality damage to environment domination of more powerful wars and terrorism the problem is aggravated by abrupt introduction and imposing of formal rules and concept of justice strange to local culture in many developing countries including those in transition the major intention is for instance formal introduction of bioethical codes and request of individual decisions in societies in which is culturally deeply rooted communitarian familial tribal approach besides described and often discussed “big” ethical problems related to life and death artificial insemination abortions suicide euthanasia etc for health practice are often important daily “small” problems often hidden by daily routine or covertly present as special care and interest for benefit of offended like private interests of professionals imbalance in power of health worker and patients inequity of arrangements and attitudes toward patients by age gender social position private relations finding balance between quality and costs etc on the relation and trust between professionals and people in need frequent “small” ethical problems may finally have a greater impact then scarce “big” problems case study “dom narodnog zdravlja” home of people’s health community health centre medical policlinic  growing big and loosing soul community health centre domovi narodnog zdravlja dnz was an original concept in organization of primary health care the first root of that concept one can trace more than  years back  when the first health centres were organized as an active part of “hygienic services” a štampar in the former yugoslavia they had the following departments for hygienic education and propaganda for epidemiology and for “social medicine” ie preventive services and integrated dispensary care for priority risk groups and “social” illnesses maternal and child health school hygiene and malaria tuberculosis venereal diseases trachoma et similar the principle of “dispensary medicine” was integration of prevention social support and curative medicine dnz covered one or more districts operated health posts in small communities and were responsible to regional hygienic institutes in yugoslavia in  were  institutes of hygiene  dnzs and  health posts out of them in croatia  hygienic institutes  dnzs and  health posts a small number for more then  local communities principal source of financial resources was state budget with only some examples run by health cooperatives major change started in  when new health centres “domovi zdravlja” dz financed through health insurance was organized they incorporated all outpatient services at the primary care level including previously private general practitioners and all special dispensaries working for a short time as self standing institutions the law on  organization of health services  established them as “selfmanaged organizations” founded by commune and financed through compulsory health insurance they continue to contribute to health education but started also during sixties to participate in medical education undergraduate and postgraduate for nurses and physicians the dz were besides the cradle of a new specialization of generalfamily practice in  and remained the most important basis for organized postgraduate teaching and research in primary health care in  health insurance was decentralized to the communal level at that time health centres were expected to deliver comprehensive primary care based on dispensary type of work they were either self standing organizations or merged with all other health units in a district ie also with specialized medical services based in outpatient departments of hospitals the regular technical meetings of professionals in best of dz contributed to development of a system of permanent vocational education during the years period of  the numbers show restructuring of organizations and an increase of dzs in comparison with the mcs and particularly with the independent smaller heath posts zdravstvene stanice” zs table  table  number of medical centres mc health centres dz and health stations zs in croatia in   and  year   mc   dz   zs       the average size of individual health centres was also rising so that in  only  dz have been staffed up to  physicians  dz employed  physicians and  more than  physicians of them  had even more then  employed physicians and two more then  the false philosophy was that big organizations are more efficient however the opposite was true the “soul” of an original “home of health” was lost team work was replaced by bureaucratic management and control the additional contribution by local community diminished what combined with general economic crisis lead to dissatisfaction of health worker and consequently clients the analyses showed that integrated approach to health care was successful around general practitioners only in small dzs but preventive and social aspects were poorly treated in big organizations where prevailed polyclinic treatment the participation of people and close relation with community were also disrupted and formally performed only on “higher” administrative and political levels this was the way how the last days of selfgoverning socialism demonstrated inefficiency in yugoslavia during the severe aggression on croatia after partition of yugoslavia  mc and  dz were destroyed but the decentralized system and devotion of health professionals contributed to successful protection of people after the war during the time of transition the main solution for described weak points of dzs otherwise adequate organizational pattern of primary health care was found in “privatisation” the preventive services and important public health nursing became part of centralized state public health services and teams of general practitioners persuaded to start independent “private” contractual relations with the croatian state health insurance previous dz in that way remained only an administrative shell caring for premises the integrated approach to health care remained only a traditional attitude  of some of general practitioners and some of mch and school dispensaries it happened right in time when in many developing and of the most developed countries ideas of group practices and small health centres became popular the case is interesting because demonstrates how sociopolitical and cultural factors influence not only public health principles but also organizational patterns besides the health technology based on human relations obviously is suffering from big organizational structures exercises task  a changing world first think about necessity and available resources your task is to write a mission statement of your organization b vision statement of your organization mission is declaration of existing general

realistic according to experience of some economists d salamon the time needed for change in technology is  years in the market behaviour and habits of people  years in management  years     the criteria for assessment of your written statements will be clear and easy understandable not ambiguous realistic and rational not just idealistic jingle socially ethically and culturally acceptable and memorable and vibrant not bureaucratic and dull what you have learned during this exercise reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues task  big issues of “small” ethical problems in routine health practice one may argue that all ethical problems are “big” because of their gradual but growing influence on identity and moral personality of professionals the trustfulness of whole profession and behaviour of people they are usually a slippery slope between normal traditional and “expected” behaviour and corruption of basic moral conventions sometimes people do what is far from their declared principles the best way to learn about ethics is not to know by heart principles but to discuss the experiences of daily practice your task is to “discover” the main daily ethical problems in health practice you know discuss the reason they are present and how one may prevent them to reach the risky level to list them you may first reflect on the following short and oversimplified stories cases  case  confronting interests “i may trust only in tests done in laboratory where i can supervise the quality of work you have been already in two other laboratories but you can see that results although falling in the same range slightly differ this is the reason that i have to ask you to repeat the tests and this time in laboratory i am supervising new results will not necessarily change your treatment and the diagnosis may remain same but it is better to test again and be sure and safe if you do not follow my sincere recommendation i believe you better find another doctor” said the doctor who is a famed specialist what the patient will do case  restricted choice an elderly woman with osteoarthritis of her knee is trying to find a new doctor because two previous doctors she consulted recommended her almost only to observe diet and reduce weight and did not listen to her experience of beneficial massage with an ointment she has forgotten name they also repeatedly insisted on physical therapy in spite of her complaint to the health administrator they offended her because she is sure they would listen to her more carefully when she could pay them some money the third doctor who was asked to take her on his list refused her telling that his list is full case  hidden external influences after talks with the representative of a wellknown pharmaceutical firm the physician was persuaded that a new drug for diabetics type ii would be better for his patients and he decided that all of them should change therapy and use the new recommended drug because of his interest the representative of the firm decided to facilitate doctor’s attendance to an international congress in rome paying him the air ticket has doctor accepted that offer case  ethics of public programs the public media announced invitation to all women over age  to report for a mammography test for early diagnosis of breast cancer the procedure is safe and lifesaving they stated and all women with positive and suspicious results will be immediately advised to find an expert for further treatment for those who cannot pay for further treatment there would be a chance to get help by charity organization is it correct that the invitation does not tell anything about possible drawbacks case  priorities a policy is discussed about the way to arrange the list of priorities for some surgical treatments in short supply the usual points are discussed to keep strictly and only the order in which patient came to ask for treatment or would it be necessary to look for some additional facts under discussion were judgment of relevant experts about medical factors eg urgency expected best results age and gender familiar conditions eg number of dependents other social factors socially recognized important people experts creative artists national symbols etc and sponsors able to materially contribute to the development of similar services by additional equipment or training of health workers  although the group was aware that the existing practice will not be in accordance with principles of their choice they agreed that only the order of coming and age of patient younger have advantage may be used as criteria of priority was this a correct decision case  informed consent the informed consent of patient is important and the requirement was introduced that patients should sign a printed statement before a number of important medical procedures asked to sign such document an elderly man asked for  days time to consult members of his family it was explained to him that it should be a personal decision and a shorter time can be given to him for thinking it over but the final decision has to be his own after explanation the man refused to sign was anything wrong in described procedure case  life is multidimensional a middle aged man worker living alone with chronic respiratory problems was frequently coming to his doctor for new drugs and few friendly words one day quite unexpectedly he brought a sum of money not complaining and not asking for anything but telling to the nurse and doctor who came into the nurse’s room that this money he prepared for them surprised doctor and nurse felt offended because they never asked money from their patient and asked “but why are you doing this have we not been always kind with you” “indeed and this is the reason that i brought to you this small amount of spared money” the doctor and nurse refused money and after a short argument patient took the money back and left after several days the doctor and nurse heard from neighbours that the man committed suicide the life is multidimensional and simple rules are not always adequate case  how to assure equity how to decide whether a health unit is contributing to health equity among people obvious answer is that a no cases of discrimination are recorded this is however only the peak of the iceberg to be confident about the sustainable fight against inequity there must be fulfilled also other conditions b like guaranteed universal access regardless of personal characteristics physical and geographic restrictions ability to pay et similar c adequate knowledge and skills empathy and concern of professionals for patient ie style of work are an additional but probably the most important prerequisite the additional requirement includes d personal relations observing privacy and dignity of people understanding of cultural and social differences even more is required by the further task e full responsibility and participation in the process of health care both by health professionals and patients the crucial measure f would be advocacy of health needs of people in front of higher authorities and fair distribution of resources among the broader scope of other services representing the disadvantaged and handicapped people proactive attitude is the most difficult additional duty requiring political skills and full engagement in the life of community it is partly out of reach of local powers but without raising that voice the chances for benefits remain doubtful using the described scale try to estimate how is a certain health unit you know contributing to equitable health of people  case  inequity as avoidable inequality in a school all children are treated equally school lunch physical activity learning conditions but their health growth and development never end as equal and they are disappointed in another school the children are treated in an equitable way and their health growth and development have a tendency to be comparable and they feel satisfied illustrate what is happening in these schools and how you understand difference between equality and equity case  ethical intervention ladder there are always many complaints that the general conditions state policies role of industries media and other parties are responsible for poor health care should public health programs organized or supported by state persuade people to start participate in health programs and coerce adults to lead healthy lives by antismoking laws traffic regulations etc actively intrude into personal and familial life or opposite has state be just a careful observer simply monitoring the current situation provide information enable healthy choices providing incentives for healthy behaviour and restrict and eliminate free choices of people only in cases when the health risk of others is endangered along what is called the “intervention ladder” look for “stewardship model“ of public health application of ethical principles nuffield council on bioethics public health ethical issues a guide to the report  internet wwwnuffieldbioethicsorg the criteria for assessment of your result  your awareness of hidden “small” ethical problems in practice  demarcation of ethical problems personal and professional balancing interests of professionals and those in need formal consent and free decision of choice quality and costs of medical procedures equity and equality  group reflection on origins of unethical behaviour and ways to prevent it  group opinion on intervention among colleagues eg in case that one of colleague is alcoholic corrupt prone to fraud patients unacceptably poor in knowledge and skills what you have learned during this exercise reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues learning by reflecting life stories as opposite to learn principles references  jakšić ž ed experiences in primary health care selected case

as part of health practice želimir jakšić herman r folmer luka kovačić theoretical background the health system is complex and dynamic education and training is a common starting point in most of interventions aiming towards improving health care practice however choice of contents methods and educational technology is part of local health culture general cultural social and political conditions fragmentary introduction of new element into existing system might be not only inefficient but also introduce confusion and even damage therefore one has to understand essential policies and realities of the whole system here are described possible wrong managerial decisions in two directions acceptance of circumstances as a fixed structure not open to any change conventional error and opposite to this assuming that everything is open to change utopian error figure  complexity of the health care system the right approach is obviously somewhere between these two errors but it is often hidden by tradition all kinds of ideologies and direct political utilities one has also to consider that the system is dynamic and changes may occur unexpectedly because usually not all facts are known and local circumstances change under influence of broader environment a changing world “knowledge society” the xxist century is meant to have several essential problems to solve unequal progress in different countries and in depreciated groups and individuals in countries  growing environmental problems including shortages of water and energy ageing of population double burden of health risks as result of epidemiology in transition social and cultural changes in an global postindustrial and information world with not yet known health and social consequences figure  the knowledge society for all of these problems starting with economy the solution is found out in creative production and use of knowledge the problem is how the knowledge is understood and how it could be measured is it factual knowledge an objective truth or proper knowledge presenting individual or group ideology do we need scientific knowledge or wisdom is heart of the problem recognising true or false results or application of what we know or both factual and from experiences today dominate measures of rigorous but formal criteria academic or administrative competitive comparisons more about production then about use and utilization of knowledge as p liessman critically observed the concept of knowledge society was transformed into a postulate of informed society “information age” and consequently a necessity of lifelong learning learning learning is by itself not a simple process of acquiring new information and remembering facts but a complex transformation of personality and development of new ways of behaviour because of that it has to be acquired it is not possible to transfer it it is an interaction of experience and reflection abstract conceptualisation and practice d kolb’s model of learning  one has to differentiate training acquiring a skill and learning acquiring of knowledge and education imparting and accepting of knowledge but also becoming cultured first is memorizing facts and knowhow but it needs further reflection and interrelation with own experience what is leading to interpretation and understanding of meaning followed by obtaining proper attitude of mind and finally gain the whole integrity oversimplifying that process or interrupting it to early create disappointments one well known related to health care was in seventies of last century when funcionalists tried to simplify  education of frontline health workers training them what needs to be done in certain conditions without understanding why “medicina simplificata” many textbooks have been printed in form of cookbooks it was shown however that such training could be successful only when supplemented with education about rational of processes and significance on the given task for the role of health worker the other unfortunate example is at present under severe pressure of copious information when facts are received without context and interrelation what is producing a feeling of learning and knowledge and is quite opposite producing “halfeducated” intellectuals insecure or not critical to suggestions so that marketing messages could be accepted as important new knowledge figure  the educational media centre network in croatia as a support for education in primary health care educational goals have often to combine quite opposite capabilities and attitudes how to become critical and trustful how to be proactive and thoughtful how to collaborate with others keep own believes and tolerate opposite how to decide in emergencies or under threat of uncertainties without relevant data how to combine scientific rigor professional dignity and political skills how to participate in and lead teams developing them from hierarchical to functional and to interdisciplinary ones the content of learning is special item to be considered new technologies facilitate approach to new information distance learning internet etc but in the same time open an important question how to escape of an avalanche of information potentially interesting but not necessarily useful how to chose what is valid and credible important and relevant for practice applicable and acceptable  the scientific facts are not sufficient for their interpretation the cultural and ethical values are necessary culture culture is one of the most complex expressions with many connotations the term may be understood as just production of arts cultural industries or as traditional folklore or ultimately all manifestations of social life such as customs religions rituals habits of association and institutions the controversies might appear between for instance between national and international understandings in search for identity among intellectualism spiritualism and aesteticism as different approaches or ideologies of expected social progress between cognitive and emotional reactions in creation of personal style and manner figure  film as a attractive media used in health education a separate feature is identity of health culture it is built from many layers of people’s experience and believes years of interaction with health and medical professionals complementary alternative and antimedicine obsolete slogans and commercial messages lasting persistent and resistant to change for countries in transition a widely spread attitude that health may be sacrificed for economic development is difficult to change in believe that contrary health is of vital importance for economic development it is a worldwide problem in many developing countries collectively as well as in families and even individuals education and development the different connotations exist in many essential factors connected with the role of education in development there is not one rule and one truth to be implemented  therefore it is wrong to transfer and import solutions but necessity to harmonize approaches in a tolerant way and most important to analyse not only short living policies and economic suggestion but also cultural and ethical aspects learned people should not only become knowledgeable and aware of new possibilities but also better understanding the own position capabilities and interests educated personal attitude is decisive indifference of those who know little is most hazardous but equally dangerous are utopianism and despair of sophisticated academicians without touch with practice figure  education for health is important factor contributing to the development case study international postgraduate course “planning and management of primary health care in developing countries” introduction from  until  at the andrija štampar school of public health school of medicine university of zagreb organized  international courses of  week duration each course was attended by between  to  participants  of them in total from  mostly developing countries the participants attended the courses were medical doctors nurses environmentalists economists and other professionals usually younger than  from middle level management the courses were organized as a joint cooperative program between the governments of yugoslavia former until  and croatia  and the netherlands  the course was designed to link planning and management with specific technical procedures and social functions of health workers more than theoretical considerations of techniques in planning and management course aim and objectives the principal aim of the course was to train professionals in the field of planning and management of primary health care in developing countries the course was designed to link planning and management with specific professional contents of primary health care and the understanding of social processes which play an important role in decisionmaking and cooperation in the field of primary health care according to the stated aims participants experienced in management of primary health care were recruited the specific objectives of the course were • to develop and support positive attitudes towards primary health care as a part of social development and towards the people as the main active element in the health system to reinforce positive attitudes to rational methods in the planning and administration of services • to develop skills − in analyzing and solving technical and organizational problems of health services and techniques in the judgment of alternative solutions − in resource allocation and health planning particularly development of adequate health manpower − in communication team work and leadership • to increase knowledge to be used in − listing and assessment of technological and managerial problems encountered in primary health care − problemsolving methodology − analysis of status of health trends in community development and health priorities relation of health to other sectors of development − orientation as to the position and involvement of the community in health care planning and practice − planning and management of integrated comprehensive primary health care services tackling typical problems such as maternal and child health and family planning prevention and control of epidemic and endemic diseases nutrition health education organization of medical care − health manpower planning development and leadership − monitoring and evaluation of health services and control of implementation of health plans − training and research in primary health care course content the course was organized in blocks which last on the average about one week every block combines theoretical parts of teaching individual reports by participants and working group results practical exercises and field visits planning and management were linked with the contents of primary health care and actual examples so that  individual programs developed into more complex ones and finally into the whole system the final choice of contents and order of presentation were adapted according to the needs of participants block  introductory block dealt with the refreshment of fundamentals of planning and management it was an opportunity for the participants to get to know each other indicators for particular countries are compared and problems of the development of the policy and strategy “health for all by the year ” and “primary health care” were discussed block  dealt with general social and economic components and conditions for the development of primary health service as well as with general social and economic aspects of planning and management the process of policy formulation and broad programming was analyzed the first two blocks include experiences of the health system organization and development including field visits block  covered questions of selecting topics of appropriate technology and development strategy this part includes certain phc components such as environmental problems sanitation and communicable disease control field visit were included examples of specific programs such as endemic disease control programs were used to discuss the problem of integrating these programs into comprehensive primary health care block  covered the health program formulation and detailed programming the comparisons were made between programs under different circumstances rural urban settings migratory population etc the relations between phc and different parts of health services especially hospitals and specialized medical care were analyzed field visits and exercises were organized to demonstrate different working conditions block  dealt with maternal and child health regarding measures and strategies and particularly manpower planning training and management of phc practice special attention was given to dilemmas of health manpower at the grassroot level and to the profiles of the middlelevel managers at the district and provincial level block  dealt with major resources such as a community participation b coordination supervision communication and leadership c health economics and management of material and financial resources d mental health health education and operation of health services block  covered planning and management methods as applied on different models a model province from a developing country was used for studying indicators problem analysis assessment of development trends and priorities resource allocation organization supplies and monitoring of services based on the knowledge from previous blocks participants were taking part in a system of managerial games and exercises and evaluate the results and outcomes by real experiences from their own countries block  dealt with a synthetic approach to phc from the point of view of contents of work and components as well as from the point of view of organization and management major problems of phc implementation constraints and obstacles were analyzed by working groups of participants at the end of the course a final conference was organized during which participants presented their plans in solving actual problems of phc in their field for the coming year  teachingtraining methods participant’s responsibility during the course was to participate actively in the teaching program in several ways to conduct joint sessions working groups and discussions and to describe problems and experiences of their country as well as to give short lectures on topics they have experience in according to the assessment of teachers and participants the recruitment of candidates and their active participation in most of cases was very successful lecturers were in a position to discuss problems with participants and not to merely give lectures the main information blocks lasted usually  minutes and were followed by discussions and further solving of specified problems work in small groups of  participants was a frequent and regular form of teaching with the aim to elaborate specific primary health care managerial problems in details the participants were split into  working groups problems were presented in a form of a panel discussion very interesting and motivating for the participants were role playing and games  the participants also had a task to write the final paper being a plan of action in phc management in their position at home for the coming short term period the final conference was held under several topics in order to achieve the objectives of the course on an average oneday visit to different institutions per week was organized every field visit was organized so that participants had specified tasks in observation surveying and reporting the health care settings and functions for the course participants the course manual consisting of ten chapters following in general the structure of the course by blocks was edited and distributed to the participants as the handbook for the course the manual has  pages and was distributed in the related teaching blocks the course manual was reedited each year the participants were also provided with various materials of the world health organization “who leadership development for mental health” “management development for primary health care” “primary health care towards the year ” “the health centre in district health system” “acute respiratory infections in children” “technical bases for the who recommendation on the management of pneumonia in children” as well as from almost every institution they visited the basic concept and terminology used in the course were in accordance with the terminology of the world health organization “managerial process for national development within the strategy health for all by the year ” evaluation the evaluation process includes a formal evaluation organized at the end of each training block and a more detailed one at the end of the course block evaluation consists of anonymous answering to standard questionnaires based on fao questionnaire recommended by a holland group of experts in  and followed since followed by oral evaluation in which all participants in turn comment the last block and suggest changes to be made in the blocks to follow final evaluation of the course follows the same procedure only using a more detailed questionnaire evaluation of the  course as an example of the evaluation regularly used in the international course “planning and management of primary health care in developing countries” here is presented part of the official  course report related to evaluation  final evaluation questionnaire   the size and the composition of the group  out of  participants assessed the size of the group to be just right for the purpose of the course  participant found it to be too small and  big regarding the composition by professional qualifications most answers are also in the category of “just right”  answers but  of them answered the group was “too mixed” and  “not mixed enough”  the contacts during the course practically all the answers to the questions on contacts are positive both regarding professional and informal ones it is interesting to note that the participants of this year course assessed their contacts in both categories as the same positive while in the last year course the contacts within the participants were less positively assessed than the contacts with the staff  the duration of the course most participants evaluated the duration of the course to be just right both with regard to the program covered  and with regard to their own requirements   the program of the course all the participants assessed the course program to be well balanced neither too rigid nor too lax most of them were satisfied with the balance between free time and amount of homework assignments but  of them assessed to have had not enough free time and only one to have had too much of free time  the relevance of the course in this section of the evaluation questionnaire the overall relevance was assessed as well as the relevance of lecture notes and manual field visits and the equipment used most of the participants rated the course as relevant  “very high”  “high”  “acceptable” and  “low” the average was  on the scale from   very high to   low the answers regarding some specific aspects of the course also fall in the same categories regarding the training topics the participants most frequently mentioned the following subjects as the ones most useful for their future work comprehensive diagnosis community participation management techniques resource allocation health manpower development and health education it should be noted that in answering this question they listed as much as  subjects  subjects were mentioned as not so useful for their future work but almost all of them only by one participant this indicates that the choice of topics was very well balanced and matches the interests of the group members  lectures and practical  participants evaluated the theoretical level to be just right  too high and  too low  of them also judged the practical level to be right neither too complicated nor too simple for  practical were too complicated the share of both theoretical lectures and practical work was assessed as appropriate and accordingly the time available for each of these training forms was perceived as balanced  the teaching methodstechniques the participants when asked to assess to what extent had individual teaching techniquesaids been effective in contributing to increase knowledge insights and ideas ranked the following ones as the most effective field trips discussions case studies practical work most or all of the lecturers were perceived as responsive stimulating participants initiative using their experiences and prepared to discuss about what they said  organization and facilities  the administrative and secretarial support was assessed as very good  good  and satisfactory  and with only one participant assessing it as unsatisfactory the average rating for the lecturemeeting rooms was  ie between very good and good the average rating for the quality of accommodation was  lunch was organized in the school restaurant as well as dinner in the first week upon arrival after that money for dinner was given to participants in order to give them more choice to prepare it according to their own wishes the organizers provided the participants with all the relevant information on cultural and sporting events in the city a guided city tour was organized as well as the visit to the croatian national theatre participants had the opportunity to play table tennis at the school premises various other forms of social activities were also going on such as the international dinner dances parties etc as usual but most of participants expected more experiences and proposals for the  a general observation for this years course was that the course corresponds to the needs formulated by candidates and on the other side the group composition is responding to the policies objectives and methods of work announced in the course  the main orientation of the course to the middle level management is internationally recognized as one of the most important strategies for the implementation of policies of health for all and strengthening of primary health care the world health assembly has stressed the district action programming as one of the essential elements in national health development and this is exactly the policy followed by the course in zagreb this is well reflected in the criteria for the selection of candidates course objectives and type of training activities during the course  the essential influence of the type and kind of candidates was evaluated several times before this year the candidates were on a good professional level and were a very motivated group all the group members were participating very actively which was achieved through different types of active assignment field and group work exercises and structured round table discussions as well as through individual contacts with teachers and institutions of interest  the general schedule of the course seems to be adequate the course is very concentrated and requires maximal effort from every participant the printed manual has proved to be of great help  the participation of foreign resource persons has again proved to be very satisfactory j eshuis from the royal tropical institute in amsterdam n sartorius from the world health organization zuhal amato from turkey and p reitmaier from the university of heidelberg germany a tradition of inviting guest teacher and resource person from developing countries was continued also this year this practice to have the firsthand experienced expert from developing world as well as to continue the practice to inform and activate the world health organization and other international organizations to support the course in proposing candidates following them helping in evaluating the course and actively participating in course performance and cooperation among similar training institutions is viewed as very useful for that reason a proposal for further participation of teachers from developing countries is forwarded annex   the world health organization the royal tropical institute in amsterdam the ministry of science and technology and the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of croatia were of great help in informing and recruiting potential course  participants with their help the number of applicants was bigger than expected due to political situation in this part of europe the ministry of health of the republic of croatia was very ready to take the sponsorship of the course  this year close cooperation with the zagreb international fair continued with organization of panels and practical at their premises and this was a great opportunity to practice the assessment of world medical technology  missing participants from americas which probably happened mostly due to shortage of time between announcement and the beginning of the course was regarded by other participants as failure of the course organizers list of

economist nov    your task start or improve work in your “learning organization” “learning organization” is a more or less stable group of small number of colleagues who regularly meet to reflect on the experience in practice or data from other steady and carefully chosen sources better not directly from well known experts but from documents journals and also through new technologies such as kinematics distance learning teleeducation internet webbased training besides important is horizontal communication and partnership with users patients students and public media they should know what you are working and you should reflect on their experiences organizational learning is based on the team learning open system thinking stimulating individual capabilities building cohesive vision and cultural values see d schön c argyris  consider attitudes the group should accept • people need to understand the purpose and meaning of what they learn enrich functionalist task analysis of the group deliberate role functions and tasks without further elaboration if it is difficult to start recommend that reviewing daily professional activities of group members • recognize intellectual expert cognitive capital and discuss the road from facts to wisdom accept that knowledge could be an object of management knowledge management km • admit the importance of capability in performing health care because knowledge alone is not sufficient the capabilities of group members might be different and this is beneficial for group learning all capabilities like also all factors of intelligence might be of equal value capability is as intelligence a balanced ability in solving problems at work and in life however the importance of emotional and social intelligence is particularly large for health professionals • agree to survive the flood of information escape playing around with vague and ambiguous terms and “interesting” but not relevant information for critical choice of readings one may use ebm evidence based medicine  criteria the content should be  valid and credible  important and relevant for practice  applicable and acceptable • • • it might be useful to refresh understanding of learning processes differentiate factual knowledge what consciously reproducible procedural knowledge how largely unconscious instinctive” forgotten experience personal knowledge assimilated into own cognitive processes case analysis and problem solving ps definition and analysis of the chosen problem generation and comparison of several alternative solutions application and evaluation of consequence and finally most important recapitulating what we have learned experiential learning el especially important in postgraduate and continuous learning major dysfunction is separating “theory” and “experience” effective learning is not just memorizing facts other important conditions are • involvement in practice and group reflection about cases and experiences • choosing multum instead multa especially when learning skills • stimulating creativity eg by trying out suggested new techniques actively participating in research playing problemsolving games by writing articles etc • besides technical reading and other books not only newspapers and not only journals • practicing physical activity and regular relaxation the criteria for assessment of your plans to improve the “learning organisation” you have to include regular work at least one hour each month involvement a small group of   members with similar interests and possible different experiences securing steady input of technical information stress on essential process of group reflection on specified actual cases implementation of new knowledge into practice is decisive criterion in evaluation what you have learned during this exercise reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues task  development of a teachinglearning module a teachinglearning module is an element of teaching and learning treating a defined problem in health practice and aiming to solve it by increasing knowledge and experience of involved health professionals stimulate modification of their attitudes and changing their behaviour it is usually a part of a larger educational program or of continuing learning your task design a oneweek seminar to improve management of primary health care teams consider format for constructing the teachinglearning module  • identify what you should change choose a concrete problem out of actual practice in a setting members of the working group know use individual reports or “brain storming” of participants • estimate possible improvements feasible under given conditions one week of organized teachinglearning • define educational objectives overall and specific regarding knowledge skills and attitudes • choose title of the module it is best to be in form of a question and easy remembered –it will be probably later revised several times • write short introduction describing rationale • choose the target group of participants students particularly those from whom one may expect to implement what was taught • list tentative subject contents • discuss appropriate teachinglearning methodology it should be regarded as a whole dynamic way not just a list of teachinglearning forms learning should be active and taskoriented a kind of learning by doing the seminar itself should demonstrate what is recommended as methodological approach sometimes a short lecture or description of a case is a good starter the most important is to be realistic and available time has to be considered it is not recommendable to cover by information a vast territory without planning time to for “digestion” and reflection about relevant issues • think over how will be assessed what students have learned and how they could demonstrate their capacity to implement it in practice • allow time for evaluation and answer of the group to the question what we have learned solve logistics and organizational problem estimate costs and find the way they are covered find premises and places for field work provide and check necessary equipment make certain that teaching materials are ready and available think about accommodation and provisions entertainment and free time of participants • solve formalities invitations and information of those concerned invitation of celebrities publicity catering etc • • • • • format of presentation • written rationale and title • list of specific objective and how they will be assessed • schedule of teaching activities by contents form and time • oral explanations comments and justifications criteria for assessment of your result • are the objectives relevant to the identified problem and do the solution follow contemporary tendencies in human resources development • is the way of assessment related to objectives • do contents and methods of teachinglearning correspond to objectives  • is the teachinglearning schedule realistic and feasible what you have learned during this exercise reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues task  supervision and control are important parts of teaching and learning your task read the description of an event from practice answer and discuss the following questions and others you guess as important the young health technician has come back from his first supervisory tour he complained to the medical officer that community is very unhappy with the way in which field workers are collecting data and advising people how to improve hygienic conditions in their households and preserve food their behaviour will have repercussion on the whole programme of rural sanitation in this region he states several people complained that damage was done to smoked meat and other food conserved for winter sometimes quite large samples have been taken and some rotten parts have been destroyed instead used to feed animals he asked the medical officer to intervene one of experienced field workers meets the doctor in charge the next day he is a mature person and works in that locality a long time he is wellknown to everybody people like him and give him sometimes small gifts consisting of their home products he states that some of people do not yet understand the meaning of new sanitary measures but are following all requests because they are nervous and afraid due to recent outbreaks of food poisoning and trichinellosis he complains that the young supervisor although coming from the higher schooling does not know how to communicate with people he has seen several families and apologised for bad work of field workers who do not only explain what has to be done but also inspect take samples and destroy immediately rotten food he asked medical officer against the new supervisor who is not only inexperienced but also arrogant doctor promised to organise a meeting to discuss situation • • • • • • discuss in the group the following and other relevant questions is such case an exception or a typical case what is the essential cause of described tension whose side you think doctor should take is a general meeting the best way to solve the problem who is actually responsible for described conflict how you would solve a similar case   the criteria for assessment of your result answers to questions explanation and justification of conclusions special attention and weight will be given to the last two questions what you have learned during this exercise reflect on your experience and discuss it

would need for professional medical help at which level of health care every health care system has its medical doctor of first contact who works in the interface of the population and health care the development of primary care went in creation of health care teams organised according to the need of the population the approach to health care in primary care is different from the approaches in secondary in tertiary care the emphasis should be put on comprehensive care of the health problems from the viewpoint of the person and from the viewpoint of the disease the approaches health problems the patients and the organisation of health care are different from the ones we know in secondary care characteristics of primary health care primary health care has the following characteristics  • long term relationship with the population it serves • personal contact with the patient and his family and • comprehensive approach to health problems  it is characteristic that primary health care takes care of health problems that are common quite often these problems are dealt with in a specific way morbidity in primary health care an average primary care physician deals with at least  of all health problems presented to him and only a small minority is sent to other specialists or to hospital usually the patient is referred to hospital or the specialist through a referral letter and discharged from this kind of care through a discharge letter the referral can be done either for a specific short intervention eg specific examination consultation or a more long term cooperation is envisaged when the specialist is involved in a long term management of one of the conditions the patient may have eg a diabetic patient in an advanced stage of the disease may require support from a diabetes specialist for that disease primary health care task profile the specific morbidity in primary care influences the tasks performed by this service the content of primary care consists of the following measures  health promotion and disease prevention especially within the vulnerable groups of the population children women at childbearing age and with specific diseases and conditions  management of diseases  emergency situations  palliation organisation of primary health care professionals these tasks are performed in an organisational structure that is variable from setting to setting traditionally primary care was mainly delivered by general practitioners in offices or at home with the development of medicine and the changing requirements for health services the following profiles were developed for primary care  the general practitioner the main driving force in primary care is a general practitioner who traditionally took care of all the health problems and all the groups of the population in some countries his role was seriously challenged and some of his tasks were given to other primary care specialists  other physicians involved in primary care some countries have introduced specialist care at primary level as well therefore we have primary care dentists paediatricians taking care of the children school medicine specialists occupational medicine specialists primary care gynaecologists ophthalmologists and internists they usually take care of either a specific group in the population or they take care of a specific health problem  nurses adequate primary care can not function without proper nursing support in general two kinds of nurses exist  • practice nurses are employed to work in practice and take care of the administration of the practice • community nurses are a specialized health care profile that works in the community their main role is taking care of people at home coordinating care of patient requiring constant care  other health professionals a host of different health professionals may be involved in primary care the list includes laboratory workers physiotherapists emergency car drivers and others  nonhealth professionals in order the primary health care to function other nonhealth care workers are necessary they perform their tasks according to their original education and adapt their knowledge according to their work eg economists organisation all these professionals may be organised in a dispersed manner through a network in the recent times coordination of services within group practices is more common some countries eg former yugoslavia have developed health centres as organisational form of delivering primary health care this system has proven to be a good innovation regardless some of the limitations it has encountered conclusions adequately organised primary health care is the cornerstone of every health care system if organised properly it is able to provide high quality health care for reasonable prices with good health results for the population this is why it has always received a high priority in health care policy exercise primary health care can be taught at various levels using different teaching methods depending on the level of students’ knowledge and the teaching aims the following example of exercise entitled “patient in primary care” could be used as a module for students at the beginning of their study the timetable suggestion is presented in table  table  timetable for the exercise entitled “patient in primary care” day day  day  day  days  day  introduction

specific recommendations for teachers assessment students of  primary health care želimir jakšić luka kovačić theroretical background primary health care is essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford it forms an integral part both of the countrys health system of which it is the nucleus and of the overall social and economic development of the community alma ata declaration  introduction the strengthening and further development of primary health care is a policy accepted in many countries the question is how this concept is implemented in practice in the difficult economic and social conditions to mention only increasing unemployment and international debts there is both a need for adequate socially sensitive and well balanced primary health care and also a growing opposition to these ideas under financial restrictions the weaker partner usually suffers more this is a decisive moment for future of primary health care and for the health of people in general there is no time to delay decisions or wait the social aspects of primary health care are essential primary health care has to be organized according to social realities in which communities live and work because of that a variety of solutions might be expected principles have to be applied with full understanding of conditions and with expectation of changes in the period of dynamic development the socioeconomic relations community structures differences in power and interest existing communication and other social networks have to be taken into account there are also specific ecological conditions which influence the differences in epidemiological situation health risks and needs the orientation of health care towards the needy and the underprivileged rural populations youth elderly etc is one of the important principles the growing inequalities in health have to be opposed by an essential change in socioeconomic relations the problem cannot be solved by establishing a second  class service for such groups as it is often in reality primary health care has to be differentiated from primitive health care  adapted from jakšić z folmer h kovačić l šošić z eds planning and management of primary health care in developing countries training guide and manual zagreb andrija štampar school of public health medical school university of zagreb   another social aspect of primary health care is covered by community participation and involvement communities have to decide what they want in the way of health care and how to achieve it more than in any other field there are many false and disappointing ways by which this concept is put into practice unrealistic expectations are raised without changing the general social and political conditions new approach to the technology of primary health care is needed in some instances it will be sufficient to adapt existing technologies to needs but many new ones have to be developed selfcare group care and community care are few examples in reality however hightechnology approach has suppressed primary health care considering it only as a vehicle for delivery of services primary health care should be developed as a health discipline in its own right research and education should support this development primary health care is expected to build a bridge between traditional and contemporary specialized medicine therefore it should be organized using the intermediate and combined type of technology it has to be different from haphazard practices of traditional medicine and also from specialist polyclinics which are regarded as the prototype of medical industry the organization of volunteers and support of free initiative might be examples of success in practice but continuity of activities should be secured the reference and communication with other parts of the health system provided and profit making malpractice avoided organizational forms of primary health care different organizational solutions in implementation of phc have to be expected under different conditions ie in individual countries and health systems this does not mean however that every solution is appropriate integration of health programmes interaction and coordination of work of health and other sectors continuity and building of permanent infrastructure are intended principles in reality a strong confrontation among different programmes is a common finding the controversy between selective and comprehensive primary health care reflects deep differences in political interests and social policies primary health care is envisaged as a general solution for all types of communities and all people it was repeatedly stated that primary health care approach should be the general answer to health needs of all people regardless whether they live in better developed areas or in poor and underprivileged circumstances in urban or in rural settings however very often primary health care is wrongly conceived as a special project for delivery of health services for poor rural population some of these population groups really need to have priority but they should not be considered in isolation primary health care is not a second class service for the underprivileged different intentions are covered under the same name of phc for instance the role of hospitals in phc is a very sensitive point declarations and realities have to be differentiated a system of community  based health centres provide a working model but bureaucratization and over institutionalization have to be avoided without strong  political commitment and planned intervention under the name of phc a service will develop with emphasis on medical cure and care the communityoriented health workers and family practitioners volunteers auxiliaries nurses midwives and physicians their team work and leadership in the health field should be the focus of the system they should be accepted and close to local culture and because of that accepted by people in reality their attitudes interests and training are often far from peoples interest and culture besides their power and position in the hierarchy of health services are very low the implementation of phc demands active support by the whole health system among the most important requirements are the appropriate political atmosphere planning of adequate resources reorientation of health workers intersectoral collaboration and networking of the involved institutions verbal support is usually given to these phc principles but restrictions are imposed sometimes the financial and best human resources are oriented to other parts of the health system besides this phc is often organized as a special project to other vertical health programmes the networking is often formal and every sector carefully watches its own resources there are differences between intentions and realities in implementation of phc but at least intentions are now well formulated they have to be protected from corruption hard work and a long way are ahead the question is why the difference the gap between intention and real practice is still widening in many places is it because the economic conditions diminished implementation simply because not enough was done by responsible groups or because there is another intention hidden growing a “new vine in old bottles” case study organization of health care in croatia health care services in croatia are organized on three levels primary secondary and tertiary primary level generalfamily medicine paediatric

citizens have health insurance based on the equal entitlement to overall health care with a high level of solidarity health care in croatia is financed from several sources a major part of the croatian health system is financed according to the national health insurance model the funds are collected from the contributions from employees salaries that are paid by employers based on salary percentage from the farmers contributions and from transfers from the central government budget or county budget for certain categories of the population croatian government budget is providing more than  of funding for health care services croatian health insurance institutechii funds are collected from compulsory health insurance contributions that are paid from salaries of insured persons in croatia health care allocations amount  of its gdp which is significantly higher in comparison to the cee and see countries according to the health insurance act in croatia there are three main health insurance schemes basic supplementary and private health insurance basic health insurance is compulsory and is provided by the croatian health insurance institute chii supplementary health insurance is also provided by the chii as well as by private insurance companies private health insurance provides higher standard of health services than provided by the basic obligatory insurance coverage the chii insurance scheme provides basic health services to insured persons through their legal right on the socalled packagebasket of health services this packagebasket strictly identifies health care services covered by the chii as well as health services that are paid through the supplementary health insurance scheme apart from the participation charge some health services are paid directly by the patients such as non  prescription drugs the citizens pay full price for some health services in private health institutions this especially refers to dental health care specialistconsultation service and some services provided at private polyclinics special stateowned or private hospitals  access to health care every citizen has right to choose hisher own primary health medical doctor general practitionerfamily physician or paediatrician for children and gynaecologist for control of pregnancy and gynaecological problems parents can also choose the gp for their children this is mostly the case for the rural and underserved areas but recently also for urban areas in the case that gp is family physician specialist individuals with chronic diseases are followedup by general practitioners family physician or paediatrician for children gp can ask advice from the specialist if  shehe can not solve the problem of the patient diagnostic procedure recommendation for treatment prescriptions for the chronic patient are done by gp for acute patients the procedure is the same as for the chronic patient in the case of emergency the emergency service is called by the patient or family emergency cars ambulances are equipped by physician technician and driver after health problem is solved by emergency services and hospital if needed patient will continue hisher care by hisher own doctor patients with long term care use the health services in the same way if they stay at home if they need the nursing care there is community nursing service what can do nursing services in the home patients gp is asked to prescribe such services if patient needs such services for longer period than health insurance administration should confirm such needs if patient is not able to live at home there is possibility to be hospitalized in the hospital for long term care r she or he can go to elderly home each elderly home has rooms for bedridden patients nursing care in such situation is taken by nurses and assistant nurses employed by elderly home medical care in the elderly home is provided by gp dental care is at primary level and the access to this care is free for everybody te most of dental care practices are private but they have the contract with the health insurance for free treatment of population physiotherapy is organized at community level patients need the referral ticket from gp to the specialist physiotherapist who can order physiotherapy patients can be seen by gp free of charge before april  patients had to pay tax of  kunas per visit – up to  kunas per month for the use of specialist service patient have to pay certain amount this payment is covered by additional voluntary insurance and patients who have this type of insurance will not pay tax exercises care task  compare of intentions and realities in primary health primary health care is a crucial term for the studies in public health and related specialties it well known descriptive definition and explanation of meaning is described in the declaration of alma ata  there are several layers in the meaning of that term in this exercise we shall simplify it by speaking about principles and components or elements of primary health care dividing these two aspects may help in clarifying the exact meaning as we conceive it in practice you should answer the questionnaire individually and then compare the answers with the opinion of others in the group individual and group attitudes estimates and judgements of principles and elements of primary health care as they appear in theory and “in practice” will be specified in expressing your own opinion in the questionnaire you should consider real circumstances there are no good or bad answers but differences in attitudes and individual experiences you will find that some questions are ambiguous and general so that it is difficult to answer them in such situations you should try to think in examples if you find differences between your answers and answers of your colleagues you will discover that speaking in concrete examples and pictures contributes to mutual  understanding far better than sophisticated abstract discussions you will also find that the same example may be judged differently from different points of view when summarizing the experience in the group consider that the most common “miss – interpretations” of primary health care fall in some of the following categories phc  primitive health care phc  peripheral rural health care phc  personal health care primary medical care besides there are deep ideological controversies hidden under the term of primary health care is it meant to be the same as basic health care or is it selective or comprehensive integrated phc

urban areas and for rural areas with dense as opposite to scattered populations this exercise is aiming to summarize your observations table  comparisons of different organizational patterns of primary health care specific and typical characteristics urban setting old urban setting new population structure social networks community organization and participation specific health risks and services needed phc levels and health institutions main organizational problems and dilemmas  rural setting dense rural setting scattered using notes and impressions as well as results of discussions with colleagues after different visits summarize specific and typical characteristics of visited places in relation to population structure specific health risks structure and organization of primary health care the task has to be fulfilled in small working groups and reported to the plenary session of participants for consideration the organization of health services is directly or indirectly dependent on population structure and dominant health problems but also on tradition and leadership consider interrelations of these factors what you can learn after comparing the visited places with your own circumstances have you identified some elements or details which would be useful for your services have you learned some negative experiences to know what has to be avoided expected outcomes for the task  the table  has to be completed and compared with observations of colleagues references  jakšić z folmer h kovačić l šošić z ed planning and management of primary health care in

teaching methods specific recommendations for teachers assessment students of  selective versus integrated primary health care želimir jakšić theoretical background introduction a very frequent practical problem in planning and promoting health care is finding a balance between selective and integrated special and general it is for instance a choice between developing an infrastructure of primary health care units or stimulating specific “vertical” programs theoretically balancing special and general does not represent a problem both are needed and interrelated apparently very selective programs can stimulate other health activities in the community and in fact operate as a nucleus of an integrated program programs which are called integrated may simply be just a collection of selective and parallel programs in practice the dilemma has its social roots and one has to understand what lies behind one or another strategy centrally initiated projects usually have to show success in a short time under these conditions selective programs may actively destroy the existing health culture and infrastructure but also blindly insisting on integration and development off infrastructure to demonstrate achievement for political benefit of local administration may also disrupt existing social networks and discourage peoples participation another important aspect is the cost of integration integration and the resulting complexity of services will increase the visible costs but less compulsiveness and less formal regulation will reduce human costs of integration different types of dilemmas one may recognize at least four different types of headings under which appears the described type of dilemma preventive versus curative services the major division of health care appeared in many societies between privatecurative and publicpreventive health care this influenced all types of health services hospitals and primary health care units as well as education of professionals and research the opponents of integration have been pointing out negative experiences with integration because preventive services often have been eaten up by curative services there have been reports eg that community health workers are spending all their time in curative activities in contrast to isolated vertical programs in which they performed preventive activities but isolated preventive activities like screening without intervention have not been unaccepted by people and are a technical and ethical disgrace the dispensary type of work was proposed as a model  of combined activities and health centres as a combined organizational unit however a permanent effort is needed to maintain the right balance vertical programs versus health services of primary infrastructure a special service is used in vertical programs as a vehicle to provide necessary procedures and activities to cover groups at risk this approach is based on a concept of functionalism an assumption that there exists a potent and available technology for major health problems by division of labour and procedures one may increase the effectiveness and even more the efficiency of services solving one problem after another this proved true in some instances where assumptions were correct but failed in most of others some targets were reached faster but the effect was only temporary the coverage was increased on many occasions but contacts were intermittent selflimiting and superficial services were often expensive and the beneficial consequences died out after the project was finished the problem of integration of vertical programs in general health services was widely recognized during the sixties and the general disappointment with the effects was strongly expressed during the seventies and in almaata conference however resistance to integration is often very strong either because of bureaucratic powers running special programs or because of different groups in the shadows interested in promoting a certain technology specialist approach versus generalist holistic approach a special case of disintegration and selectiveness in general health services developed with specialization of health workers and particularization of health sciences in many separate disciplines this disintegration was also developing inside some of the special vertical programs mentioned above traditional medicine was and is also now often specialized with the development of new technologies the process has speeded up on one hand it is a sign of progress but on the other we can observe negative phenomena examples include the development of technologyoriented frontline health workers crippled by a failure to understand their role in society work of high level specialists on specific lines in artificial circumstances less and less interested in seeing the health problem as whole and personal problems of the patient there has been an increase in such dehumanization of medicine and malpractice of utilization of available resources in which both patient and specialist are victims of the system this problem was recognized  years ago in many countries but solutions have been accepted with difficulties unequal distribution of the most expensive technology is a consequence of social pressures and preserved under the pretext that high quality has to be guaranteed by specialization a consumer approach predominates in many circles stating that the most expensive is also the best these problems are very pressing in both developing and developed countries although with different numbers of people and on different levels health services versus community approach and selfcare this is disintegration of health services from other aspects of community life and health from other sectors this aspect of selectiveness is widely present but not yet fully recognized and completely understood it is a complex problem involving understanding of social change in  communities and their influences on health distribution of power decision making recognition and acceptance of alternative organizations in the last  years a breakthrough was made in better understanding that lay people themselves are and should be active in health care it is wrong to choose only one side prevention or cure vertical programs or general services specialists or generalists health services or community involvement it is always both but with different balances and a different focus according to circumstances such as population density kind of health problem training of health staff and changes in time the decisive circumstances the effects of special vertical programs are related to the fact are they connected with an existing general permanent infrastructure in the community or built in a vacuum the permanent structure has to be reliable from the standpoint and experience of people the structure can be any of the following social institutions local government health units schools political organizations voluntary organizations etc there are several characteristics of vertical programs which determine their role in primary health care one of them is the prevalence of health needs and technology capable to solve the problem example smallpox eradication time needed to solve the problem and terminate the program may be the critical issue the examples are centrally planned vertical programs to control some of the endemic diseases with resistant problems in which the solution require active contribution of people and changes in their behaviour it is most important that special vertical programs interact with local people and existing permanent communal services like schools health units voluntary organizations etc this is best seen in some experimental and evaluation studies in the field of nutrition and sanitation in a situation where health services grow it is common experience that some of the vertical programs coexist side by side with general health services to overcome this separation a formal integration is proposed so that working groups of a vertical program are organized as separate units inside regular services at least some information and coordination of work are forced and the problem of status or differences in wages and salaries is diminished organizing such integration is often very difficult because of changes in authorities and responsibilities and a double command arising as a management problem a similar situation may be produced following the division of labour inside general health services when some parts of programs grow fast and gradually organize themselves as separate service units we have a phenomenon that growing produces disintegration maternal and child health dispensaries for special diseases or separate population groups occupational health services preventive services etc can demonstrate such a tendency inside primary health care if they additionally have or develop a separate authority on a higher level of services or administration there is a very similar situation which can happen after formal integration of parts of vertical programs into general services this is then an apparently integrated service but actually functioning as a selective program  examples are common in services providing permanent health care for problems considered to have great importance mch tuberculosis control cardiovascular diseases etc how to make the best balance selective approach and integrated approach may both have positive and negative consequences depending on time and circumstances in that sense the two strategies are not completely opposed positive consequences of selective approaches include • • • • momentum in motivating people fast results increased coverage efficient use of certain specific resources among negative consequences one may list • • • • • limited duration of effects tendency to develop petrified structures waste in manpower development of narrow professional interests separate kingdoms inefficient use of resources and poor participation of people in the long run the integrated approach building into the permanent general infrastructure has these potential advantages • • • • interaction with people and supporting participation permanent longrange results equitable coverage if this is one of the chosen aims motivating local resources and stimulating selfreliance as negative consequences one may consider • • • • the drop in the sea effect unfavourable results such as prevention suppressed by curative services slow development poor quality in real life selectiveness and integration are the poles of the same system and the time dimension is neglected the transformation of services from differentiated to integrated and than again to differentiate is overlooked the essential differences are shown in table  in decision to foster one or another approach the following arguments are important  type of health needs which are prevalent or most important in circumstances in which chronic diseases and long lasting problems prevail when many multiple diseases and problems appear when prevention has to be stressed  when psychological and social aspects are important and when continuity of care is needed  in all these situations an integrated approach has advantage  participation and involvement of people when a free choice of services and a closeness of services are needed when equity needs to be stressed when one has to utilize potentials of primary groups families voluntary organizations etc for health care and when an intersectoral approach is needed  the integrated approach again should be the first choice table  two

derived from the quality of individual work and assessment of the contribution to the group discussions  the role of hospitals at the beginning of the new millenium želimir jakšić theoretical background introduction the future of hospitals and health services is a fashionable subject in the current discussions at the turn of the century and the millennium  nevertheless it is a necessity because of different technical and economic pressures anyhow it is a challenge because of the complexity and uncertainties in dealing with one of the oldest social institutions deeply rooted in every culture while forecasting dreamers and entrepreneurs meet to express their desires and interests history has to be called upon and future quested the facts reviewed different practitioners everywhere hope for new solutions however we know that most of predictions are regularly wrong even in the short run in spite of that the exercise is useful as a chance for critical consideration of complex facts so let us enjoy carefully once again our myths and expectations past experience there is an old saying that those who do not know their past do not have a future hospitals had a glorious past  it may strengthen selfconfidence and our myth that it has been one of the basic institutions of our civilisation it will continue to fulfil certain essential needs of people being one of the strongest features of humanism solidarity and charity as well as of creative potentials in science and technology during a long history hospitals were continuously changing so that diversity is one of their characteristics being a part of a local culture they also reflect general global trends at present the winds of globalisation are stronger following an overall trend in technology and economics this is producing social tensions and problems in extreme examples some prestigious hospitals in many countries serve only the needs of powerful minorities and many expensive technologies are misused at the expense of relevant primary health interventions for a broader circle of poor people hospitals are here to stay but appropriate “social diversity” has to be protected for the benefit of people and efficiency of resource utilisation a review of different types of hospitals speaking about types of european hospitals we should consider them in the broadest way not only their shape and organisation but also the main structural traits like mission and aims or position of staff and patients for our purpose we will choose some which have played a greater role in the history of europe and which have influenced our thinking today  when we start thinking about established institutions we have to describe some of the famous ancestors of hospitals  • the aesclepieian temples in ancient greece where in front of statues of “saintmortal” aesclepius his daughters hygiea and panacea and other members of his families priests and priestesses interpreted oracles and ordered treatment figure  “temple of asclepious” in split and hospitium in zadar • valetudinaria originating from latin word valetudo – health and thermae in roman times where soldiers and civilians were searching for health this early recorded examples were sacred places combining the powers of gods and nature for recovering from illnesses but also strengthening health and capabilities of people in the same places and with the same idea we today have spas rehabilitation centres thalassotherapeutic recreational and tourist centres etc following these old european roots we come to immediate ancestors • • hospitia original latin meaning of places offering hospitality were predecessors of a number of hospitals developed by christian religious orders in monasteries widespread in the middle ages hospitia and these hospital served pilgrims travellers poor people and others following the traditional hospitality and seven works of mercy as in the previous times the main aim was to reduce suffering but even more important was to save souls very similar arrangements but at a smaller scale as a shelter for very old and chronically handicapped or ill or very poor were organised by priests and nuns in rural areas close to parish churches and sometimes by neighbourhoods for people without relatives some of these continue to serve until now  figure  “aquae iasae” varaždinske toplice figure  hospital close to church northern croatia • a completely different mission had quarantines lepperhouses army creases military lazarettes and poorhouses organised by local and urban governments at  about the same time the aim was to protect the community and prevent the spread of epidemics figure  the first quarantine dubrovnik • younger hospitals in urban areas were offsprings of hospitals related to monasteries and poorhouses organised by public authorities to shelter ill people who could not afford it themselves they were run by physicians and sisters so that treatment and care were organised according to a new experience of medicine on one hand it were help to suffering patients and on the other serving to protect the urban community to satisfy feelings of justice solidarity and charity in the th century they started to be separate from asylums and it was a real beginning of an institution which we now call a hospital it is difficult to regard present hospitals as direct successors of all these institutions because medical science technology and management changed thoroughly in spite of that some of the principle perceptive can be found in most types of the present hospitals general hospitals homes for the elderly and handicapped and similar sociomedical institutions acute and longterm hospitals modern hospiciums for palliative care etc are all closely related by origin modern technology the birth of scientific medicine and development of complex diagnostic and treatment technologies influenced several types of institutions • specialised hospitals dispersed cottage hospitals and paviliontype hospitals reflect also specialisation in medicine different types of patients’ needs and relevant technologies difficulties in transportation in some areas and better feelings of patients  figure  city hospitals zagreb figure  sanatorium for tuberculous patients zagreb mountains • “industrial” or monoblock hospitals were the result of concerns for costs best use of expensive technologies and experts monoblock hospitals are still most preferred a typical industrial hospital is efficient but presses the staff to work onlines in an industrial manner contributing to developing narrow specialism  figure  “industrial” monoblock hospital zagreb clinical hospital lately for various reasons such as a changed medical technology a growing urbanisation better means of communication multimorbidity etc the division of hospitals to special and general hospitals has gradually changed to classification of hospitals to acute shortstay and chronic longstay hospitals this is a possible reminder of hospital heritage what may one conclude let us underline only general and lasting characteristics  importance deep cultural influences and social embedding of hospital  distinct closed and powerful structure beyond the role as a unit of health services  diversity based on different mixtures of continuously same missions caring for the needy enhancing social security and quality of life of ill people protecting community and collecting experiences and teaching medical arts  capability of adapting to deep changes under the influence of external developments in spite of solid general structure numerical data describing the present situation in europe is working about   hospitals and they employ the largest part of health workers representing  of the total workforce of europe making one of the largest industries  during the last decade in most european countries one can observe an increase of beds in longstay hospitals while in acute hospitals the number of beds is slowly falling and in the same time the number of admissions is increasing figures  and  illustrate changes in the period  in europe  in spite of the recent reforms and containment policies around  of physicians and  of health expenditures are spent by hospitals figure  illustrates recent situation in europe   figure  number of hospital beds per   inhabitants figure  inpatient care admissions per  inhabitants the differences among countries are evident and largely understandable especially between the north and the south and the east and the west  they are understandable  because of the past developments and can be seen in most properties of care arrangements and delivery patterns figure  percentage of physicians working in hospitals as an illustration of striking differences in hospital data interesting data are shown in figure  northern countries count higher numbers of longstay hospital beds and eastern countries shortstay hospital beds although negative correlation has been demonstrated between the number of the first and the other the relation is not strong and may be explained by several extreme results and by the way how the beds are classified many countries in europe except for nordic countries face the shortage of beds for low intensity longterm care this shortage combined with growing needs undeveloped conditions to support home care unresolved tensions in financing and running a sociomedical institution between health and social care authorities has pressed general hospitals by necessity to mix together short and longterm care and consequently work apparently inefficiently last available data for  in comparison with those of  are shown in table  because of changes in administrative arrangements the comparisons during a longer period are difficult or even impossible one can recognize differences between established market countries eu and cee countries rates describing admissions and length of stay in acute care hospitals are higher in cee countries there is however even a greater difference between mediterranean and nordic countries higher rates of admissions and shorter length of stay one has to interpret it carefully because weighted averages are calculated from data coming from different sources in spite of that one has to accept the fact that the differences exist not only between the european east and west but even more between the north and the south    beds in nursing  elderly homes  relation of numbers of hospital beds in nursing homes and acute hospitals  y  x   whoeuro

countries and groups of countries in europe but there is also a general trend towards more admissions shorter length of stay and a growing number of beds in longstay hospitals an important additional fact is that in most countries around half of physicians and  of expenditures are used by hospitals  factors influencing the shape and type of hospitals hospitals have symbolically followed the path from a temple to a cathedral and further on to an industrial enterprise and “recreational” centre always following the leading historical trends and being close social powers however hospitals of europe live under rather different conditions predisposed not only to different health needs and economic conditions but influenced even more by traditional social and cultural factors one important european issue was the role of the family and consequently religious political and social way of life including the use of social institutions etc  a number of factors were described in literature as influencing and gradually shaping the hospitals figure  and table  advances in medical technology factors influencing prospects communication technologies provision of services economics health policies health needs higher education social policies figure  factors influencing prospects of hospitals the influences may be formally divided into factors affecting hospitals in different ways as it is presented the inner circle has a direct an immediate effect and factors in the outside circle have an important influence which is visible only a longer period possibly several decades the intermediate group of factors is most visible and re presents the main concern for managers most of factors usually start influence from outside but they launch internal processes and may present themselves as being genuine the factors related to technological and managerial changes spread fast and affecting many countries usually starting from the richest and often frustrating the poorest most experts a priori regard them as progressive advancements so they create a fashion and express themselves as obvious internal needs their impact is direct and mostly connected with essential technologies medical and other interfering with basic procedures  table  a tentative lists of factors influencing prospects of hospitals intermediate circle • rising costs of medical procedures and interventions  social inequalities and poverty  problems of privatisation and market mechanisms in heath fields  government charity economics and social policies • health policy  general and family practice  home care  doctors and patients’ rights  quality management outer circle • social circumstances  diminishing family ties and breaking down of social networks  age structure and transcultural migrations of populations  mounting of violence and insecurity  complex collaboration of charities nongovernmental organizations free initiatives • changes in health needs  health problems of affluence behavioural obesity …  alarming numbers of impaired handicapped and dependent people  higher pressure towards prevention and rehabilitation  returning problems of infections and ecological threats  addictions and mental problems • higher level of education information and expectations of people  active partnership and participation in medical decisions  awareness of limits of medicine and utilisation of complementary services  protection of personal rights and moral concerns in relation to experts  increasing prevalence of “minor” psychosociomedical problems with severe consequences  tightly packed mixture of scientific facts and advertisements the next group of factors often causes tensions and subjective responses because they are understood not as an objective necessity but individual or group decisions and policies expressing their interests in that way they operate as external and also as internal factors they appear to be dynamic but often looking for dynamics without change usually their essential nature can be recognised and judged only after some time the outer circle of factors is producing slow changes regularly not noticed or ignored as unimportant for some time however in the long run these factors are the most decisive ones they are bound to local conditions and might have a variety of meanings in different countries regions or situations the majority of described factors start as external but some is initiated from the inside of an institution by a successful scientific or managerial group or a purposely built rd department recently the total quality management tqm has demonstrated an ambition to stimulate such processes in considering the future changes of hospitals one may systematically consider all factors recognise those most influential and find strategies to utilise them  in summary we may state several at the first glance contradictory statements • hospitals as deeply rooted cultural institutions will survive all main types of hospitals acute longstay community and teaching will continue to exist but will probably follow different ways this statement may be illustrated by monitoring of data about acute and longterm hospitals as well as about the number of admissions • nevertheless the old “citadel cannot hold”  a wave of alterations in medical styles becoming gradually more active in diagnostics and treatment will influence the opening towards community besides the fast change of medical technologies will ask for extremely flexible and permanent innovations the shift of functions substitution of techniques and relocation of places is under way as can be illustrated by a shorter average length of stay in hospitals emerging of hospices spread of dayhospitals growth of hospital outreach services etc it is pending that some types of hospital should be reinvented or developed • in a society longing to become hospitalfree and declaring against institutionalisation one third of people might need traditional hospital help epidemic of old age persistent poverty at the level of  of people socially induced pathology violence stress unemployment insecurity addicts the infirm and handicapped all produce a wide range of needs oriented towards social and health institutions because social support and family resources are scarce a great number of different types of institutions working units associations selfhelp groups etc increase the need for improved communication and a greater effort for improved collaboration waves of health reforms during the last decades there have been permanent waves of health reforms initiated by international organisations and powerful political and economic centres  during the seventies health for all policy hfa was globally spread together with all other “for all” egalitarian policies initiated by united nations it stressed the importance of community based primary health care and was critical to the medical establishment it gained support in governments of many especially developing countries but it faced resistance by groups of medical experts and some international organisations it was implemented in some developing countries as selective vertical primary care in most of developed countries it was transformed to a kind of primary medical care based on teams of general practitioners the reorientation of hospitals was requested towards embedding it within the frames of health care as a support and consulting agency of primary health care the reduction in the number of hospital beds was seen as important strategies to turn upside down the triangle representing the health system with hospitals on top and primary health care at the bottom particularly regarding health expenditures the most important point was equitable distribution of services the impact of hfa policy was slow but improvements were globally documented in the meantime the economic and political situation changed from favouring egalitarian to libertarian manner it was largely ideological and political based on ideas of neoliberalism the earthquake produced by the fall of the berlin wall prompted a tsunami of health reforms not only in countries being previously behind the iron curtain but also in all other countries it also divided international  agencies on one side world health organisation and on the other side world bank and other bretton woods institutions table  timeline of major health policies modern times postmodernism libertarian conservative right health policies structural adjustment health reform globalization new integrated transitions  hfaphc new phhealth promotion new hfa strategies egalitarian socialist left health policies structural adjustment as a new economic and social policy produced the health reform as a policy for health sector health reform was an attempt to raise health concern of people and stimulate medical productivity of health services by pushing health into the area of private interests and competitive state of affairs governments were under political and economic pressure from inside and from international agencies to reduce “target” social provision and introduce competitive and contractual conditions in public funds specifically in the health field the arrangements were made to separate providers from purchasers and to foster competition among the providers health was largely regarded as a private good and health care as a commodity trade the expectations were to reach better quality of services and higher productivity by spending less public resources it was welcomed in many countries of central and eastern europe as a sign of freedom a chance for entrepreneurship and personal achievements after years of shortages suppression and imposed discipline although in a number of countries hospitals were partly protected from radical changes there were attempts in others to strengthen the competition among them as providers by different means including their “privatisation” these efforts were not always successful so that already in mid nineties the pendulum was swinging back however the tendency to reduce the number of acute hospital beds continued and their substitution by other types of services was promoted the described health reforms changed the previous picture of health services in many countries but also destroyed some of the traditional resources without empirical proof of advantages of market relations in comparison with bismarck or beveridge principles in the field of health care besides many reforms were under influence of  shortterm expectations based on efficiency and narrowly conceived vertical health programmes as is usual in projects influenced by outside donors a considerable part of liberated energy of health experts was lost in reorganisation and financial management instead being used to improve health care provision the greatest cost of reforms was seen in the field of growing inequalities in health between the rich and the poor and also in ethnic majorities versus ethnic minorities between genders and among different age groups deterioration of health condition of deprived social groups was demonstrated in many developing and developed countries the political monetary and trade powers supported irresistibly the spreading of libertarian ideas to all corners of social life it started to be a global phenomenon during the last decade of the past century it should have brought benefits through liberalisation of trade and fast exchange of information because it is targeted towards growth and productivity the potential threats have been recognised in deterioration of ecological conditions suppression of local cultures and prescription of political solutions by big powers because it appears that some people are more global than others direct health damages are possible in human trades migrations unemployment spread of social diseases and violence epidemics power of transnational corporations with trade and not health interests in medical industries and similar in table  possible perspectives of health systems in modern and postmodern times are tentatively presented  selected trends in technical and managerial aspects of development are listed mostly those in which changes one could witness every day table  perspectives of health systems development selected technical

in such a way it becomes clear that many and various results could be foreseen different developments are possible in the future our individual activity in searching for the best solutions might become the most relevant issue one has to conclude that the issue of health in the recent changes of health policies remains unsettled a search for a new balance between productivity and equity in health is persistent is a third sustainable way just another utopia or a valid possibility although it is a general political question there is plenty of room for technical innovations which will finally decide the way of hospital perspective and social practice two ways of thinking about the future mission missions declaring the outlook towards future are the result of different combinations of two major ways of value systems these diverse approaches developed to satisfy different human needs and were presented already in the ancient myth about daughters of asclepious panacea and hygieia in the life of stationary health institutions they were pictured in old hospicia and valetudinaria they are evidently present also today in different health policies and consequently in different types of hospitals table  table  an ancient dichotomy panacea’s highlights hygiea’s emphasis from ancient temples to acute and some long stay hospitals passive patients’ role resting and treating healing diagnosis technical relieving from valetudinaria to rehabilitation hospitals sanatoria and some hospices active patients’ role activating health promoting application human strengthening gods and science people’s necessity authority individuals specialists power and excellency nature and experience people’s utility support communion experts trust acceptance and fairness today basic issues focus around two expressions quality and equity   we may describe them in terms of presentday “sacred cows” the most au courant concepts so often quoted in the form of acronyms table  however it is difficult to differentiate them clearly because the terms have changed their connotations quality and equity are the best examples  quality has changed from the traditional meaning of a technical excellence of services towards market oriented meaning of “satisfying people’s perceived needs and demands” equity has changed from the traditional concept of an essential part of  human rights to equity in legal rights fairness “the art of possible” and partnership “shared responsibility”  table  current opposite views in terms of “sacred cows” quality equity ebm  evidence based medicine pr – patients’ rights tqm – total quality management hfc – homefamily care pel – professionalism leadership ethics lo – learning organisations and phc – primary health care pp – patients’ partnership ss – sustainability and subsidiarity ee – efficiency and effectiveness so we have to conclude that in searching for the best definition of hospital missions there is a tendency of moving towards integration an attempt at least to break through the traditional institutional walls in spite of many real life difficulties current policies and their criticism the missions are translated into policies among important policies expected to solve problems and also open new lasting perspectives we may identify the following • new health market reforms informed patients’ participation  the patientcentred hospital • the change in contents orientation towards health and quality of life  the healthy hospital • quality management based on “learning organisations”  the learning hospital • conservative elitist approach hospital as the centre of excellence • close relations inside the health system especially primary health care supporting initiatives such as “hospital at home”  the collaborative “well embedded” hospital there is a positive intention in each of the mentioned policies and in some of the examples of their implementation a combination of them in different quantities may fit to needs and wishes of hospitals in different situations at the same time they raise opponents and consequently difficulties and constraints patientcentred hospital patientcentred hospital in its full meaning should not be just a hospital where all services are organised around patients but where both the patients and the public are well informed about their work and performance and could participate in decisions on strategies for development  it obviously could help in communication and “marketing” but the decision making process should not be delayed or distorted it also raises a far reaching question how much of medical “secrets” one should “disclose” to the public nobody is apparently waiting for the answer the process is already running see for instance web sites of national committee for  quality assurance health care report cards etc the time will tell us if it is going to be related to benefits and detriments of patients medical experts and hospitals as institutions the pending questions about tactics remain  is it wise to change the tradition at the time of growing alternatives emerging in the market not even thinking about presenting the objective results of their work  are all parts of the health system willing to start the same and how could it be controlled health promoting hospital the european pilot project supported by world health organization is now over then  years old  the budapest declaration of  specified strategies and responsibilities of potential participants in an international network it was followed by a formal agreement  and vienna recommendations the core group of  hospitals evaluated and reported an impressive set of subprojects subprojects were related to health of patients patient satisfaction nutrition health education rehabilitation hygiene and safety to health of staff to health of community promoting children health prevention of accidents control of alcoholism young people information service etc and to metaphorically conceived “healthy organization” of hospitals effective communication with patients decentralization networking etc largely the projects are improving and complementing hospital services building outreach services and better networking with others aiming to involve or influence a broader group of european hospitals most of the participants at present are in the group of hospitals with  beds obviously one has to consider new roles of different types of hospitals to avoid a change of terms only and to avoid mixing of roles with different other partners in the health system particularly primary health care the critical points consider a potential problem in building new hospital based outreach services using the existing resources in an expensive way learning hospital the development of learningteaching networks supported by modern technologies of interactive telecommunication seems unavoidable sooner or later most health institutions will be interconnected “virtual integration” without vertical integration grounding great potential gains  as a simple start one may describe a project called eurotransmed it involves a growing number of several hundred hospitals in europe for lunchtime interactive lectures every tuesday during the teaching semesters these are coded satellite lectures and discussions in real time several similar national networks exist in countries of europe many worldwide possibilities are open through the internet the critical point is not how to get information but how to choose the right ones and organise their use the flood of information may be counterproductive thus increasing the danger of hidden control by sponsors and others looking for their individual interests and not for common benefit it is not at all an easy task for users to judge the quality of information the clearing and control of information on the other side may destroy all potential benefits some applications of telemedicine might suppress the local expertise and experience instead of supporting it often it is easier to teach others than to learn ourselves centres of excellence centre of excellences are important as references for quality and as the only way to organise and protect one’s own values and rationality in the field of technology transfer under pressures of global economics there are many unresolved questions  should centres of excellence be nominated or let to develop they could get more resources and a “trade name”  so that many would like to be considered for such a position the essential factor for success is an able team of experts with a wide understanding of local health culture and policies potentials and needs and at the same time practicing scientific approach and rigour experts have to show outstandingly firm integrity such teams develop over years further structural questions are would it be better to concentrate teams in one place centralised approach or distribute and disperse them in several institutions are teaching hospitals by definition centres of excellence there is not a pattern showing definitive advantages and the answers depend on local conditions  therefore this policy will be open to permanent local struggles and a political issue in most countries collaborative hospital collaborative hospital is the objective of a broadly supported policy one can state that it is widely accepted but rarely realised  the immediate problem of collaboration is that all those who should collaborate are counting on the same resources and because of that they do not trust each other the other problem is that often hospitals are bigger and stronger institutions and may dictate conditions for collaboration one of the major difficulties is rather deep mutual misunderstanding with others because of multiple essential differences one can demonstrate it by considering just a few basic differences between hospitals and primary health care units table  table  some characteristics making difference between hospitals and primary health care units characteristics hospitals phc units system’s property environment closed medical establishments open community priorities focus of activities diagnosis and treatment solving problems solving health problems work with people feeling of safety way of thinking higher convergent lower divergent there is no chance to overcome these deep systemic differences by nice words in summary all described policies look acceptable and sound well however they have their shortcomings it is understandable that many hospitals are cautious as well as their partners in health field and in circle of policy decisionmakers how could somebody believe that the most powerful of all health institutions will start to change beyond what is necessary for marketing purposes and their own interests the way to show a substantial interest is not to declare intentions in big words but to start changes and evaluate them step by step should one consider new types of hospitals the form and name of hospitals will change we already observe spring ups such as “hospital substitutes” “hospitals without beds” day care hospitals “hospitals at home” “virtual hospitals” “telemedical hospitals” etc  there is a great interest for comparing and evaluating inpatient hospital care and home care   one has to conclude that new types of hospitals are probable and one has to be prepared for changes it might be important to consider new types built on foundations of the existing hospitals deep changes have to be expected because of changes in technology there are already experiences how to deal with them after a certain time of adaptation finally one has to build a new structure which is new in spite of carrying the old name the other kind of change is under pressure of people’s needs and demands in this case new buildings might be constructed  based on old concepts but often under a new attractive name the new name shows a tendency to cover bad feelings and experiences with the traditional institutions although the contents might be similar under such circumstances the answer to the posed question whether reforms or reinventions would be needed should be – both is probable for instance reform of teaching hospitals might be needed invention of health oriented contemporary valetudinaria as it is described bellow and reinventing of new community hospitals as it is described later under the title of case study the teaching hospital a traditional teaching hospital fulfilled tasks in research training and the most complicated part of medical treatment “tertiary health care level” it was always complex and difficult but now it has become almost impossibility as a consequence one may observe a movement in different directions in most teaching hospitals the research part became the biggest and started to dominate the other two functions among other reasons not an unimportant one is to get resources from research funds in many countries more copious than health and educational funds consequently the stay of patients in teaching hospitals is shortened and applied technologies are sophisticated medical services are focused on diagnosis most complicating treatment procedures and critical events in that way clinical training of undergraduates is narrowed to demonstrations using training environment suitable mostly for postgraduate training of specialists teaching hospitals encompassing larger parts in different research fields and absorbing more experts became large institutions or a system of interconnected institutions in some examples this caused them to play a role of a separate part and isolated them from the general health system the problem of relative isolation led them away to research irrelevant for practice of health care for the time being and oriented more towards international relations than problems at home a related problem is that teaching hospitals are linked to health sector in the government and to universities to solve that in the few countries where teaching hospitals have not grown too big teaching hospitals alone with all other capacities for education of health workers were put in the centre of the system in charge to manage regional health care that was reported to be beneficial for relevant teaching quality of regional health care research oriented towards current local problems but hindering capacity to follow advances in basic biomedical sciences and guarantee prompt and safe transfer of technologies in other cases the system was purposely dispersed and diverse hospitals and institutions took over parts of previous tasks of teaching hospitals in training or research coordination and rational use of resources became a problem and efficiency was questioned in spite of that for most countries a decentralised system is a necessity the empirical evidence has not provided proof that large institutions are more efficient in the times of globalisation it has become more important how the teaching hospitals will serve as a bridge between countries while protection against hostile international market is growing therefore the reform of the complex traditionally called teaching hospital is on top of priorities even though the solutions are not obvious the experience from croatia today demonstrates a situation of a small country with a recent war and poor economic situation and a system in transition to libertarian market conditions our teaching hospitals are largely decentralised poorly coordinated and so far mostly swinging between tasks of tertiary care and education some important research  institutions have been built separately our teaching hospitals have a certain regional influence but not a builtup responsibility neither for development of services nor for interregional and international collaboration the shortage of resources for all sectors covered by teaching hospitals scientific research health care and education is at present hiding deficiencies and diverse interests inside institutions diminishing the total production and generating inappropriate quality of work the new valetudinarium a public rehabilitation and training centre it is well known that the change in population structure of europe and increased longevity produces greater need for care of the infirm disabled and lonely persons as well as a growing concern for health fitness and interest for active recreation more people need help to warrant better quality of life rehabilitate their physical psychological and social functions to prevent the deterioration of their conditions and to care about themselves these demands are not new but we have recently been in the middle of an epidemic situation and reasonable forecasts tell us that after  and later it has to be expected to become a normal endemic situation in all countries of europe a new understanding for these needs will certainly develop because no feasible solution is possible following traditional or modern approaches the vicious circle should be transformed into virtuous circle  figure  “from vicious to virtuous circle” g wistow “substitution” and outreach services higher acute hospital admission rate s h o s r t t a y icreased needs insufficient rehabilitation pressure on longstay and nursing insufficient home care valetudinaria figure  from vicious to virtuous circle the role of hospitals in turning the vicious to virtuous circle is multiple and important it has to prevent the increasing admission rates by developing better relations with primary services and develop “substitute” and outreach services community hospital the longstay hospitals and nurseries need to intensify rehabilitation efforts and assure the continuation of rehabilitation at home and in the communities these core tasks in caring for the elderly infirm and handicapped have always been distributed among families neighbourhoods and special kinds of public institutions like valetudinaria spas and asylums usually supported by voluntary and religious organisations  as the family role diminished dramatically particularly in countries and in a period of unseen increase of material standard of life the pressure for social intervention increased and produced a panic among governments and social services the pressure is felt also in hospitals reaction to that is seen in three directions a development of hospices specialised for palliative care b various attempts to combine health care with recreational tourist climatic rehabilitative enterprises aiming predominantly to health protection and promotion c support to home care like “hospital at home” etc in all these developments there is a common denominator in the basic philosophy assisting and enabling for better quality of life and a similar set of techniques originating from rehabilitation of disabled persons it is characterised by personal approach to mental and physical functions of each individual but also care for his work opportunities home and social environment to these are added clinical experiences in dealing with specific functional problems and introduction of proper behavioural attitudes towards preventive and promotive health activities an outstanding role is seen in activating the handicapped themselves in all spheres of life and particularly in appropriate physical activities what is still restrained in contemporary medical practice one could say that in the coming years the rehabilitation and prevention will become a relevant general medical approach and unavoidable for successful treatment and healing the question is how on the basis of the present institution one could envisage structure and functions of a new valetudinarium supporting home and primary care services in helping people to sustain their functional abilities and what is fashionably called “quality of life” it might be looked upon as a dominant and appreciated institution in the circle of the hospital family many technical and organisational questions are left to be answered and answers might be different according to local cultures what should prevail the nordic activism the mediterranean takes it easy art of life or the centraleuropean orderly regime the main challenge would be coordination and support of resources existing in the families neighbourhoods and communities as well as primary health and medical resources case study an experience from croatia as in many countries in central europe there was a popular tradition in croatia to treat people in spas so that inns and traditional hospices later hotels and hospitals and finally rehabilitation centres were raised around them moreover rehabilitation was organised in hospital departments of general and some special hospitals eg traumatology and at last also in special institutes connected with teaching hospitals the popular treatment of rheumatic troubles of the elderly and other handicapped of a growing number of injured in traffic accidents etc was performed in hospitals or by outreach units of hospitals while primary health care was largely left out and treated the major group of the same patients by pharmacological means this was a double expensive and disintegrated way of rehabilitation process gradually discouraged by limitation of insurance funds during the last war because of many wounded and disabled persons a project was launched with international help to start community based rehabilitation  it started in difficult times and developed as a separate project with evident advantages however misunderstandings and resistance were strong based on traditional attitudes about medical rehabilitation as a hospital specialty and little interest of primary health centre to be involved many other needs and demands have been identified in local communities besides disabilities of war victims it was also shown that community based rehabilitation was an effective and  efficient component making the whole rehabilitation system less expensive and improving the final results in spite of that after the greatest postwar needs have been over the project lost support the question remained if community based rehabilitation could survive competition misunderstandings and all kinds of passive and active resistance it might happen that a new type of open door institution has to face the same type of difficulties a new communitybased personal hospital when we consider possible changes of hospitals expecting benefits for the entire health system a community hospital may have the priority it should become a centre for regional coordination of health services a local focus for accumulation and transfer of knowledge and experiences the idea is that smaller regional or subregional hospitals should be transformed into an institution functioning as a vital local support of primary health care and generalfamily practitioners as well as social care and sociomedical institution for palliative care community based rehabilitation units etc this might be a new community hospital  the community hospital itself should be a combination of a traditional general hospital a health promotion hospital and a learning hospital its characteristics might be described with the following attributes • shortterm neither ultra acute one day hospital without beds nor predominantly a longterm hospital • general not specialized for any particular disease • middle sized  beds  • active in health promotion prevention and rehabilitation • community oriented transparent and visible to the community • performing and supporting some of outreach homecentred health care activities • flexible in organization and arrangements • keeping open door policy for local health experts • performing and supporting teaching and research as part of quality assurance the dynamics of changes in the described direction will differ but probably speedingup in the coming years this is clearly a common and important element of a renewed system of hospitals we will describe now our experiences in some details a warning from the croatian experience the history of hospitals in croatia was similar to those in the southern europe and later in the th century to the middle europe namely the habsburg empire the strongest impulse to organization of health care at the territory of the former yugoslavia was the work of a štampar after the world war i his sociomedical views were oriented towards “people’s health” with great energy and skill he created a system of institutes of public health and health centres active in the league of nations and having been one of the founders of the world health organization stampar was known as a “bear of the balkans” because of his energy and recently as “the grandfather of primary care” because of his principles  hospitals were not his stronghold and he could understand them only as a supportive part of a comprehensive health system in his time hospitals were isolated as centres of medical and social power to balance that power and private practitioners his strategy was to develop health and equity oriented primary care on these foundations it was not by chance that later “andrija štampar” school of public health started in zagreb the first vocational training of general practitioners  “specialization” in general practice professor a vuletić a network of health centres was spread throughout the country consisting of services provided by gps and by dispensaries for socially important maternal and child health tuberculosis and other public health activities at the same time “stationary capacities” were built as an expression of a tendency towards regional selfsufficiency the tensions between hospitals and primary services well known in many countries were pronounced in those circumstances integration of hospitals with other services was early recognized as a problem in regional centres for a territory up to   inhabitants the merge of general hospitals with all other outpatient public health and primary care units into one organization started in  and was in full strength in  the organization was called “medical centre” and  of them comprised practically all general hospitals in provincial towns except  in four biggest towns of the republic  medical centres were meant to functionally interweave prevention and care in and outpatient services even allowing interchange of physicians in and out of hospitals in the same disciplines or services the marriage existed for more than  years with ups and downs but rarely fully meeting their original objectives evaluation studies showed that the success shown in better efficiency was largely dependent on local managers who could envisage and insist on a mission of integrated health care without that additional leadership the organizations were lost in solving individual problems separately further dividing interests with an additional problem of hidden transfer of resources to the stronger part which was the stationary part in the hospital finally just before the divorce the flow of resources was legally stopped so that only administrative frame remained from the original idea of integration this experience might be important in consideration of the future of hospitals as a warning not against the idea but about the difficulties in the implementation unfortunately because of coincidence of many external economic and political factors influencing the described outcomes the main reasons for failure have never been clearly identified concluding summary  considering the future we have to understand our limits we may put together our best wishes but we will never reach the actual future surprise and shock however by formulating our expectations we contribute to the wide stream of development the future is not only in adaptation to turbulence of history and solution of present problems but in contribution by innovations experiments and daring to change the solution is in openness to new perspective while swimming in the main stream and not in protecting the old citadel  the hospital will continue to exist as an important part of a health system rather it will develop in many diverse types of hospitals in the four main classes • group of highlevel institutes and hospitals enabled for scientific research and advanced teaching • “innovated” communityregional hospitals making the backbone of stationary services built into the local network of health and social services with special concern for acute and critical episodes of medical and personal needs of patients • longterm hospitals in many forms of combined health and social institution according to local traditions and cultures • group of institutions “valetudinaria” concentrating facilities oriented towards health promotion relaxation and rehabilitation attracting a wide range of people and placed in attractive natural resorts   the hospitals share the destiny with other social institutions influenced by • socioeconomic factors such as ageing structure of populations economic inequalities immigrants growth of tensions and violence problems of affluence • fast medical and technological changes in surgery genetic and molecular interventions and other altering deeply the present medical treatment • needs expectations and attitudes of patients customers and the public • shortages in appropriate staff for human personal care interdisciplinarity of staffing and other shifting in human health resources  in spite of strong influence of the globalization trends there will continue diversity in attitudes and runningstyles of hospitals in different parts of europe in accordance with different social cultural and religious traditions social policies role of states position of families and local communities etc there will be unstable mixing of five historically developed pivots nordic and mediterranean east and west with a discrete middle with possible addition of substantial newcomers outside europe  relations and opening to surrounding community might be a promising strategy for most of hospitals except some national teaching hospitals in the long run it might prove superior to closing defending the gained position or relying predominantly on transnational medical and pharmaceutical power structures in sustaining lasting relations with communities winwin strategy should dominate relying on proper initiatives collaboration stimulation and support avoiding whenever possible the winlose philosophy based on replacement or suppression of other local resources and tendency to market domination  it is time challenging leadership and management of hospitals openminded flexibility and entrepreneurship has to be combined with wisdom and critical professionalism the investment in development of experts and stimulating work conditions has to be balanced with comfort privacy and satisfaction of personal needs and rights of patients support of inter and transdisciplinary teams and networking with other institutions are among the most difficult tasks equal only to survival in flood of information and diversity of unexpected daytoday running problems exercise recipe for the future firm mission and flexible management let us for a moment to be a captain steering a big solid ship such as hospitals are standing at its commanding deck the captain is carefully watching the main the map and the instruments what will he find he will easily spot many swimmers around trying to climb the deck of the ship but also many small boats and rafts trying to catch those swimmers for good or for bad it will disappoint him to observe how some of the passengers for non understandable reasons jump into the water and swim to small rowing boats and rafts at the same time he will continuously feel in the air strong winds pushing forward new technologies the instruments will show him the high atmospheric pressure of globalization for good or for bad looking forward he is aware of dangers threatening his ship by under cliffs and reefs of publicizing data dealing with safety and efficacy of his services besides the members of his crew repeatedly warn him that water is penetrating different parts of the ship and that it is very difficult to follow exactly his orders and manoeuvres  task what can he do and how would he like his ship to be transformed first one has to consider the actual situation the situation because varies in different countries local circumstances and is permanently changing prepare data for selected country analyse and discuss the situation in small group and present it in panel point of consideration however in all conditions there will be time to respond along with general managerial rules and local style in most cases a rather aggressive readaptation will be necessary  here are recalled several adequate rules • changes in technologies will induce changes in management “new plants do not survive in old pots” for instance new imaging technologies need a better clinical feedback and the pattern of “industrylike” hospital where specialists work in their narrow fields on a productionline becomes inappropriate for them • human resource management becomes more important than economic and technical management dominating at present • innovations and flexible organisation become more important than maintenance and survival strategies so often applied in critical situations • autonomy responsibility and accountability is needed but more important are agreed rules of behaviour than encouragement of anarchy management has to develop magic communication skills what types of skills being sensitive to requirements of patients customers to appreciate professional freedom of experts and to improve relations with competing

assessment of students  mental health care vesna švab lijana zaletelkragelj theoretical background definitions and explanation of basic terms mental health according to world health organization who mental health is more than the mere lack of mental disorder  the who states that mental health conceptualize a state of wellbeing perceived self efficacy competence autonomy intergenerational dependence and recognition of the ability to realize ones intellectual and emotional potential it is also a state in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities can cope with the normal stresses of life can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to hisher community  in this positive sense mental health is the foundation for wellbeing and effective functioning for an individual and for the community this core concept of mental health is consistent with its wide and varied interpretation across cultures  mental disorder mental disorder refers to a psychological or physiological pattern that occurs in an individual and is usually associated with distress or disability that is not expected as part of normal development or culture it is any of various conditions characterized by impairment of an individuals normal cognitive emotional or behavioural functioning and caused by social psychological biochemical genetic or other factors such as infection or head trauma  mental health care according to last et al  health care are services provided to individuals or communities by agents of the health services or professions to promote maintain monitor or restore health health care is not limited to medical care which implies therapeutic action by or under the supervision of a physician according to this general definition of health care mental health care are services provided to individuals or communities by agents of the health services or professions to promote maintain monitor or restore mental health mental health services according to last et al  health services are services that are performed by health care professionals or by others under their direction for the purpose of promoting maintaining or restoring health in addition to personal health care health services include measures for health protection health promotion and disease prevention according to this general definition of health services we could define mental health services as services that are performed by mental health care professionals or by others under their direction for the purpose of promoting maintaining or restoring mental health of a population  community mental health community mental health is a decentralized pattern of mental health mental health care or other services for people with mental diseases accessible and responsive to local needs because it is based in a variety of community settings community mental health assessment which has grown into a science called psychiatric epidemiology is a field of research measuring rates of mental disorder upon which mental health care systems can be developed and evaluated  mental health prevention general concept of disease prevention and its levels primordial primary secondary and tertiary detailed description of these levels is out of scope of this module  can be applied to all different fields of population health also to the field of mental health mental health prevention could be described as interventions to avert the initial onset of mental disorder interventions to treat these disorders and prevent comorbidity and interventions used to prevent relapse and disability mental hygiene in public health the concept of “mental hygiene” is more and more important felix and bowers  defined mental hygiene as knowledge and skills requisite to reduce mental disorders and maintain mental health levels of mental health prevention before discussing levels of mental health prevention according to public health classification we need to expose one of most important supportive elements not only for primordial level of prevention where is usually classified but for all levels of mental health prevention  a healthy mental health policy  a special document containing the goals for improving the mental health situation of the country at all levels  like mental health policy also stigma as negative companion and one of the most responsible causes for social exclusion of people with mental disorders and undertreatment is penetrating all levels of mental health prevention combating stigma should be present at all levels of mental health prevention and public education in this respect should be one of the most important efforts of public health there already exist programmes for combating stigma one of the most prominent being world psychiatric association “schizophrenia open the doors” that mission is to dispel the myths and misunderstandings surrounding schizophrenia stigma creates a vicious cycle of alienation and discrimination which can lead to social isolation inability to work alcohol or drug abuse homelessness or excessive institutionalization all of which decrease the chance of recovery  on the other hand those affected need to be encouraged to seek mental health prevention treatment eg psychotherapy and support groups similarly as in prevention of other disease groups also in mental disorders we divide prevention in four groups being primordial primary secondary and tertiary  primordial prevention primordial level of mental health prevention is aiming at keeping mental disorders from ever occurring activities at this level are mainly focused at total population and are acting by using nonspecific measures the most important activities are taken at the field of  policy in this category mental health policy healthy mental health policy and social policy targeting reduction of social exclusion unemployment and stigma are classified stable and supportive political system secure environment supporting violence prevention good housing conditions good and accessible educational system good employment policy and good care for occupational health are of great importance for wellbeing of an individual and population and also determine mental health of a population reducing unemployment and enhancing job security that both proved to be one of the main primary prevention actions in mental health since unemployment is strongly connected with anxiety depression and substance abuse  health promotion mental health promotion with providing mental health supportive social environments especially to endangered and vulnerable population groups eg mothers and young children workplace mental health promotion addiction prevention programmes etc as well as promoting healthy environment on general healthy food supplies accessible transport etc is the next category mental health promotion is defined as a process of enabling people to increase control over the determinants of their mental wellbeing and to improve it  it covers a variety of strategies all aimed at having a positive impact on mental health like all health promotion mental health promotion involves actions that create living conditions and environments to support mental health and allow people to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles this includes a range of actions that increase the chances of more people experiencing better mental health at the community level  examples of mental health promotion interventions include  • improving the social environments in schools • designing facilities to encourage meeting and social interaction in communities • promotion of healthy lifestyle • follow up and support for healthy and good parenting • promoting healthy upbringing and education • workplace mental health promotion campaigns etc the key areas of mental health promotion in the community to be addressed are therefore directed to • reducing workrelated stress including unemployment and underemployment but main focus is in reducing stressful working  conditions educational programmes for employers and employees about mental distress and mental disorders and prevention are recommended the scottish programme health on the workplace for example rewards employers for their interest in healthy and motivating environment and for preventing sick leaves similar initiatives are emerging also in slovenia in last years • campaigning for access to education and fighting against poverty and social exclusion are cornerstones of social policy directed towards better mental health of the population  programmes for reducing poverty and social exclusion this is programmes for reducing homelessness racism discrimination and stigmatization are one of the main weapons for reducing the rising mental health morbidity in europe as well as in slovenia  • social support with friendship good social relations and strong supportive networks improve mental health good social relationship reduce the physiological response to stress • stress prevention programmes with campaigning for leisure and recreational activities are further preventive measures access to relief and rest and recreation in leisure time are included bodymind techniques for relaxation could prevent a great deal of distress and consecutively outbreak of mental disorders in some individuals as well as other diseases  selfcare at the individual level taking measures of selfcare by practicing healthy lifestyles and learning of skills for coping with stress mental hygiene is very important part of good mental health  primary prevention primary level of mental health prevention is like primordial level also aiming at keeping mental diseases from ever occurring but it is dealing with endangered and vulnerable population groups eg adolescents pregnant women people in employment disabled old people etc and is acting by using more specific measures like health education examples of primary mental disease prevention interventions include  prenatal care and education about parenting  support after childbirth with counselling and practical help in breastfeeding and reducing tension and fatigue  financial and social support to families at social risk  childabuse awareness and preventive programmes  drug and alcohol free parenting programmes in endangered groups  counselling for crime victims and  somatic disease prevention since chronic somatic illness increases likelihood for ill mental health  secondary prevention secondary level of mental diseases prevention involves the early detection of mental disorders and early intervention to reduce the risk of chronicity disability and suicide early detection and treatment in all mental disorders improves their outcome and prognosis  screening especially important is this kind of prevention in the field of depression and alcohol disorders • early detection of depression as most common mental disorder proved to improve outcomes and reduce suicidal rates as confirmed by many studies us preventive services task force uspstf recommends screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems in place to assure accurate diagnosis effective treatment and followup but the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening of children or adolescents for depression  screening for depression and educating general practitioners gps for recognising signs and symptoms of depression has become one of the most widely used preventive tools all over the world this kind of education of gps proved reduction in suicide rates because of such educational campaigns are strongly embedded also in the slovenian education of family physicians and proved similar results • screening and behavioural counselling interventions to reduce alcohol misuse by adults including pregnant women is recommended as well  it is used in many primary practices as well as in some ngos and social settings through self help and counselling early recognition is of course to be followed by proper and evidence based treatment being mostly parallel psychopharmacological psychotherapeutic and educational on the other side uspstf concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening by primary care clinicians to detect suicide risk in the general population   other types of secondary prevention but not only screening programmes are secondary prevention other types of secondary prevention are case finding and health risk assessment  in some cases also an individual can help to try to find signs of disease himherself self examinations and self help are routine techniques to be transferred and encouraged with individuals with mental disorders especially when reoccurring the educational courses and individual counselling on recognising warning signs of disorder and coping strategies as well as self help groups are valuable tool in the hands of the individuals at risk and their close ones this is similar to the case in selfexamination of breasts in women to find early signs of breast cancer tertiary prevention tertiary level of prevention of mental diseases is dealing with treatment and care for people with clinically expressed mental disorders we distinguish between acute primary or early phase and chronically late or rehabilitation phase   psychiatric or primary care treatment psychiatric or primary care treatment is aiming at reducing the signs and symptoms of mental disorder improving coping abilities of patients and families and in improving adherence to treatment process the ultimate goal is also to improve functioning and the quality of life of patients  psychiatric rehabilitation psychiatric rehabilitation aims to reduce disability because of mental disorder in the patients natural surroundings which is most often hisher home environment psychiatric rehabilitation targets patients assessed and clearly defined personal needs needs of hisher carers and relatives and uses methods of empowerment and participation to achieve as high level of personal satisfaction as possible multidisciplinary team work is used to define clear rehabilitation goals and steps to achieve them with careful monitoring and follow up coping strategies are taught and discussed with patients and family member distress is managed and medication is maintained almost inevitably these methods are combined with counselling motivation self help sheltered accommodation sheltered employment and education if needed majority of rehabilitation takes place in the community even though this process is started already in the phase of psychiatric treatment the needed level of rehabilitation support varies enormously and depends on the patients perceived needs an current functioning more importantly than on the signs and symptoms of hishers disorder epidemiology of mental disorders in europe general considerations mental disorders contribute  to the total burden of disease the expected burden will rise to  in  this is  million people worldwide mental disorders contribute from  europe to  usa to the total disability adjusted life years  the prevalence of mental disorders in europe is increasing months prevalence is estimated to  in  european countries every second european will develop mental disorder once in hisher life women more often than men    almost half of the people with mental disorders have more than one diagnosis comorbidity with somatic illness and with psychoactive substances abuse and dependence are most common comorbidity of depressive disorder with coronary heart disease is    of somatic symptoms are connected with depression  which present difficulties in early recognition and treatment and consequently highly burdens medical services produces over prescription of different medication and increases the cost of treatments overall costs of depression involving direct cost of treatment and indirect cost of sickleaves absenteeism and underproduction are rising in developed countries  most common mental disorders are anxiety depression and substance abuse disorders  one fifth of women and one tenth of men will develop depressive disorder at least once in their lifetime   a who study performed by murray at al  identified depression to be heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries following by abuse of alcohol figure  figure  results of the who study “global burden of disease” source european alliance against depression eaad  the research proves that the prevalence of common mental disorders connects itself with the lower socioeconomic status or social inequality  unequal distribution of wealth is more strongly connected with worse mental and physical health and with early mortality than the gdp  the cost of mental disorders in europe amounts to  billion euro mental disorders remain underrecognised and undertreated in european union eu only  of people with mental disorder get proper treatment among reasons for undertreatment are poor accessibility of services for mental health underrecognition and stigma associated with mental disorders  the most severe consequence of mental disorders is suicidality suicidality more than  of suicides occur in the context of a psychiatric disorder depression being by far the most important one annually more than  persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide suicide rates number of people died of suicide per  population per country range from  per  in italy up to  per  in slovenia whodata  figure   figure  suicide rates in eaad partner countries source european alliance against depression eaad  europewide dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women about  of all suicides occur in the age range of – report on the state of young people’s health in the eu ec working paper compared to the number of suicide deaths the number of suicide attempts is assumed to be much higher estimates for the younger aged range from  to  suicide attempts on every suicide given this situation interventions aiming at the prevention of suicidality and thereby especially focusing on children adolescents and young people are urgently needed mental disorders are also connected to harmful alcohol consumption in addition to having a direct impact on drinkers it also poses a threat to others drinkdriving and working under the influence of alcohol drinking during pregnancy and violence related to alcohol consumption too often cause early death of mostly young people invalidity and social deprivation harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption causes more than  per cent of early morbidity and mortality in eu which represents an enormous economic burden to society at her speech at the rd european conference on alcohol policies  building capacity for action  the minister of health of the republic of slovenia zofija mazej kukovič pointed out that the estimated annual costs at the eu level resulting from harmful use of alcohol have been estimated to eur  billion or  percent of the gross national product child and adolescent mental health in eu in europe one adolescent out of five has cognitive emotional and behavioural difficulties and one adolescent out of eight suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder the prevalence of these disorders is increasing decade by decade suicide  associated with depression substance abuse eating disorders conduct disorders attention deficit hyperactivity disorders adhd and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd in children deserve concerted action developmental psychiatric disorders rarely have a spontaneous remission and may cause difficult social adaptation or mental disorder in adult life if not early diagnosed and treated  mental health on the who and eu agenda mental health is the whos agenda of priority as well as the european commission regarding eu populations health  in »health « adopted in  the target  is dealing with improvement of mental health  according to this target by the year  peoples psychosocial wellbeing should be improved and better comprehensive services should be available to and accessible by people with mental health problems preventive clinical and rehabilitative services were supposed to be of a good quality  in  who report  the following recommendations were accepted • provide treatment in primary care  the management and treatment of mental disorders in primary care is a fundamental step which enables the largest number of people to get easier and faster access to services it needs to be recognized that many are already seeking help at this level this not only gives better care it cuts wastage resulting from unnecessary investigations and inappropriate and nonspecific treatments for this to happen however general health personnel need to be trained in the essential skills of mental health care such training ensures the best use of available knowledge for the largest number of people and makes possible the immediate application of interventions mental health should therefore be included in training curricula with refresher courses to improve the effectiveness of the management of mental disorders in general health services • make psychotropic drugs available  essential psychotropic drugs should be provided and made constantly available at all levels of health care these medicines should be included in every countrys essential drugs list and the best drugs to treat conditions should be made available whenever possible in some countries this may require enabling legislation changes these drugs can ameliorate symptoms reduce disability shorten the course of many disorders and prevent relapse they often provide the firstline treatment especially in situations where psychosocial interventions and highly skilled professionals are unavailable • give care in the community  community care has a better effect than institutional treatment on the outcome and quality of life of individuals with chronic mental disorders shifting patients from mental hospitals to care in the community is also costeffective and respects human rights mental health services should therefore be provided in the community with the use of all available resources communitybased services can lead to early intervention and limit the stigma of taking treatment large custodial mental hospitals should be  • • • • replaced by community care facilities backed by general hospital psychiatric beds and home care support which meet all the needs of the ill that were the responsibility of those hospitals this shift towards community care requires health workers and rehabilitation services to be available at community level along with the provision of crisis support protected housing and sheltered employment educate the public  public education and awareness campaigns on mental health should be launched in all countries the main goal is to reduce barriers to treatment and care by increasing awareness of the frequency of mental disorders their treatability the recovery process and the human rights of people with mental disorders the care choices available and their benefits should be widely disseminated so that responses from the general population professionals media policymakers and politicians reflect the best available knowledge this is already a priority for a number of countries and national and international organizations wellplanned public awareness and education campaigns can reduce stigma and discrimination increase the use of mental health services and bring mental and physical health care closer to each other involve communities families and consumers  communities families and consumers should be included in the development and decisionmaking of policies programmes and services this should lead to services being better tailored to peoples needs and better used in addition interventions should take account of age sex culture and social conditions so as to meet the needs of people with mental disorders and their families establish national policies programmes and legislation  mental health policy programmes and legislation are necessary steps for significant and sustained action these should be based on current knowledge and human rights considerations most countries need to increase their budgets for mental health programmes from existing low levels some countries that have recently developed or revised their policy and legislation have made progress in implementing their mental health care programmes mental health reforms should be part of the larger health system reforms health insurance schemes should not discriminate against persons with mental disorders in order to give wider access to treatment and to reduce burdens of care develop human resources  most developing countries need to increase and improve training of mental health professionals who will provide specialized care as well as support the primary health care programmes most developing countries lack an adequate number of such specialists to staff mental health services once trained these professionals should be encouraged to remain in their country in positions that make the best use of their skills this human resource development is especially necessary for countries with few resources at present though primary care provides the most useful setting for initial care specialists are needed to provide a wider range of services specialist mental health care teams ideally should include  medical and nonmedical professionals such as psychiatrists clinical psychologists psychiatric nurses psychiatric social workers and occupational therapists who can work together towards the total care and integration of patients in the community • link with other sectors  sectors other than health such as education labour welfare and law and nongovernmental organizations should be involved in improving the mental health of communities nongovernmental organizations should be much more proactive with betterdefined roles and should be encouraged to give greater support to local initiatives • monitor community mental health  the mental health of communities should be monitored by including mental health indicators in health information and reporting systems the indices should include both the numbers of individuals with mental disorders and the quality of their care as well as some more general measures of the mental health of communities such monitoring helps to determine trends and to detect mental health changes resulting from external events such as disasters monitoring is necessary to assess the effectiveness of mental health prevention and treatment programmes and it also strengthens arguments for the provision of more resources new indicators for the mental health of communities are necessary • support more research  more research into biological and psychosocial aspects of mental health is needed in order to increase the understanding of mental disorders and to develop more effective interventions such research should be carried out on a wide international basis to understand variations across communities and to learn more about factors that influence the cause course and outcome of mental disorders building research capacity in developing countries is an urgent need   in  a mental health declaration for europe was adopted in helsinki  the ministers of health of member states in the european region of the who in the presence of the european commissioner for health and consumer protection together with the who regional director for europe recognized that the promotion of mental health and the prevention treatment care and rehabilitation of mental health problems are a priority for who and its member states the european union eu and the council of europe  according to this declaration it is a priority of every country to design and implement comprehensive integrated and efficient mental health system that covers promotion prevention treatment and rehabilitation care and recovery  this declaration was followed by the mental health action plan for europe  this action plan sets out  priority areas of action being • promoting mental wellbeing for all • demonstrating the centrality of mental health • tackling stigma and discrimination • promoting activities sensitive to vulnerable life stages • preventing mental health problems and suicide • ensuring access to good primary care for mental health problems  • offering effective care in communitybased services for people with severe mental health problems • establishing partnerships across sectors • creating a sufficient and competent workforce • establishing good mental health information • providing fair and adequate funding and • evaluating effectiveness and generate new evidence it stresses the need for mental health activities capable of improving the wellbeing of the whole population preventing mental health problems and enhancing the inclusion and functioning of people experiencing mental health problems  case study mental health care in slovenia epidemiological data on mental disorders in slovenia in slovenia the burden of mental disorders in is measured only indirectly and only some proxy variables allow us to infer about extensiveness of the problem on one hand we have the data on health care resources and health care utilization which tell one story about the problem by observing the number of outpatient visits on the primary and secondary level hospital admissions retirements and absenteeism due to mental disorders on the other hand there are data on determinants the third part of the story tells us morality data precisely the data on suicide thus the problem of epidemiological data in mental disorders in slovenia is that we do not have morbidity data incidence and prevalence of mental disorders since we do not have corresponding registries but this is not only the case in slovenia measuring mental health is very difficult since the data on mental disorders are tightly connected to personal data protection on the other hand measuring the burden of mental disorders isn’t a financial priority nor in slovenia nor elsewhere mindful project leaded by slovenian authors  tried to make the methodology of supervising of mental health prevention equal in several eu states but did not find common indicators for measuring positive mental health in eu adult mental health data  data on determinants of mental disorders results of cindi health monitor survey for  showed that  •  participants reported depression males  females  •  participants reported insomnia males  females  during the last month prior the survey •  participants males  females  took sedatives or sleeping pills during the last week prior the survey •  participants males  females  perceived tension stress or heavy pressure every day or frequently and had at least minor difficulties in coping with these feelings  • global prevalence of heavy alcohol drinking for slovenia was  males  females      suicide every thirtieth death in slovenia is due to suicide which is approximately  persons committing suicide per year and represent one of the nine highest suicidal rates in the world with standardized death rate of about  per  population in total population males  females   the most affected parts are štajerska prekmurje koroška and dolenjska which are placed on the east and eastnorth of the country the gender difference is  in males versus  in females which is in line with other high risk countries suicide is connected with metal disorders depression alcohol dependence and schizophrenia with old age unemployment and poverty  in conclusion we could say that in adults two major mental health problems in slovenia at the moment are prominent being alcohol addiction and suicide while depression and stress are still under study child and adolescent mental health data in children and especially in adolescents the major problem is alcohol use and abuse and possible addiction later and illicit drugs abuse several kind of evidence proves increase in alcohol and other addiction in young people and adolescent group  alcohol consumption and other addiction data from the european school survey project on alcohol and other drugs espad for the year  showed that the percentage of slovenian students who had been drinking any alcohol during the last  months was  while the proportion of students who have used marijuana or hashish was  the use of other illicit drugs was about  the use of inhalants was  and the use of tranquillisers or sedatives without a doctor’s prescription as well as alcohol in combination with pills was  and  respectively  other results could be found in earlier reports   other data show that smoking behaviour in adolescence was connected with truancy substance abuse suicide attempts and infrequent engagement in sports thus being a part of problematic behaviour in this life period and indicating that smoking is a life style of more vulnerable part of the population   depression and self esteem the study on risk factors in slovene secondary school students performed on representative sample in  showed clinically important level of depression in  of boys and in  of girls evaluated by zung selfrating depression scale the average value of results on the depression scale was  indicating that depression is rather prominent characteristic of secondary school students along to these results average value of selfesteem on the  selfrating scale was in boys  while in girls it was  on general girls expressed higher level of depression and lower level of selfesteem than boys   suicide suicide in adolescent population is among the first three causes of death in all countries that have reliable health monitoring data in slovenia   adolescent die because of suicide each year the number of boys being four times greater than the number of girls the research proved that suicidal adolescents  of girls and  of boys were experiencing family dysfunction and confrontation with unresolved problems prior to suicidal attempts and that they used dysfunctional strategies for their resolution  which provided grounds for several preventive actions on the field sport and physical activity were defined as protective factors relating to adolescent suicide attempts being a coping style in distress even though they had not proven to have a direct effect on nonsuicidal behaviour  needs assessment the need for research in mental health in slovenia is in spite of all described initiatives still enormous we actually do not have randomized clinical trials on various programmes on prevention it is also true that recommendations for evaluation of prevention are still not developed on eu level but should be prepared by eu taskforce on evidence in mental health shortly primordial and primary level of prevention mental health policy for the time being a national programme of mental health has not yet been adopted in slovenia mental health it is the responsibility of the council for health a government advisory body which includes experts from the fields of both health and social security in slovenia the former national programme for public health prevention which was operative until  did not include mental health priorities and prevention the new is in preparation and is should be adopted this year in its draft mental health is mentioned several times as important field of public health action however national programmes have been suggested for preventing suicide and dependence on alcohol and drugs the guidelines for alcohol addiction prevention were developed by the ministerial task group and finished lately actual implementation of preventive programmes still lacks continuity the mental health act which regulates system of health and social care on the field of mental health holders of activities and rights of persons under treatment including voluntary and involuntary admission to treatment advocacy and care planning was recently adopted  what can be regarded as very big step forward mental health promotion and mental health education efforts in slovenia there are several health promoting activities which include also mental health component among actions that increase the chances of more people experiencing better mental health the “wind in the hair” programme could be classified this programme is a very successful national prevention programme implemented in local communities with support of national sports association  sport activities  with concerts befriending and rewarding healthy lifestyle activities was successful enough to get a european certificate and to be implemented in several eu countries there are also many activities which could be classified on one hand among mental health promotion activities and on the other among primary prevention  programmes for infants and toddlers programmes for infants and toddlers influence above all parents’ behaviour and upbringing but they should also target social injustice prevention of physical abuse violent behaviour and provide psychological counselling at crisis for example in divorce in the neighbouring austria the literacy of parents regarding developmental phases conflict solving parenting styles and their access to relevant information about needed help are targeted in slovenia these programmes are strongly connected to primary health care teams and community nurses nationally all kinds of prevention programmes are also developed through obstetric dispensaries those providing counselling and help in prenatal and immediate postnatal periods the social and psychological interventions are still often lacking  school children and adolescents mental health prevention the concern about ill mental health of children and adolescents is one of the main areas of interest of slovene psychiatry from s  until now slovenia developed a network of mental health services for children and adolescents which were until a decade ago affiliated with the national health care service the majority of prevention and treatment was developed within the framework of educational and social care provision school counselling services with psychologists and pedagogues are today part of each school workforce these experts are strongly connected with child and adolescent psychiatric services which are in last years more often part of private psychiatric outpatient clinics than the public ones the development nevertheless follows the principles of holistic and community care with involvement of educational social and medical institutions in care planning in line with the child or adolescent mental health needs the role of parents in this process is strongly supported even stronger when the mental health problems are difficult to manage  “that is me” project in celje region “that is me” in slovene to sem jaz project was lunched for health promotion among youth in    it showed that greatest adolescents’ problems are lack of selfconfidence and optimism lack of selfrespect and fear of failure the website was launched to provide information about health and well being and to influence adolescent views and values about their health and well being and to prevent risky behaviour  “taking brain to the party” programme the programme called “taking brain to the party” in slovene z glavo na zabavo had much success in last years in illicit drug prevention  it is strongly supported by media and targets places where young people gather have parties and exercise risky behaviours  healthy schools schoolchildren mental health prevention is targeted also to the teachers who should develop sensitivity to emotional needs of children schools should develop  programmes preventing violence abuse and bullying adequate counselling is part of the psychological support to victims and perpetuators if children these programmes are being developed also in slovenian network of healthy schools this programme makes an important improvement at early recognition and treatment of eating disorders anxiety and depression substance abuse prevention is included in many local school programmes and developed on the national level as a set of educational interventions in schools mental health prevention for children and adolescents in slovenia is providing counselling workshops and seminars for teachers school counsellors and parents about psychopathology suicidality social skills training and healthy lifestyle the programme includes also drug prevention mainly through education it is performed in primary schools with the guidance of national institute for health prevention and some regional public health institutes and with prominent slovenian child psychiatrists the central psychiatric hospital and child guidance clinic are organizing professional crisis interventions in need for example on occasions of suicidal attempts suicide or unpredictable violent behaviours in schools  the “european alliance against depression eaad” network eaad is an international network of experts with the aim to promote the care of depressed patients by initiating communitybased intervention programmes in  european countries including slovenia it aimed to prevent depression and suicide  results of the nuremberg pilot study have already shown that the communitybased intervention following the levelapproach was clearly effective in reducing suicidal acts about   when evaluating the efficacy of the eaad intervention programme the primary outcome criterion is in general again changes of numbers of completed and attempted suicides in eaad intervention regions in slovene regions celje and koroška which have the highest social exclusion rates and highest suicidal rates the project included an educational programme about treatment of depression and suicide prevention with general practitioners and medical nurses the prevention programme has also been implemented with police officers social workers and priests the project was evaluated and showed important suicide reduction the regional programme for suicide prevention in region of celje conducted by zavod za zdravstveno varstvo celje a serial of preventive mainly educational activities for suicide reduction from   problems in mental health promotion and primary prevention the main implementation problem of evidence based prevention is lack of human resources and the educational gap among their acquired and needed knowledge and skills mental health promotion and prevention workforce is the people who already work in primary or secondary medical services or the people who work as teachers psychologist or pedagogues in their school working environments in last years some initiatives are emerging in educational institutions for example in the faculty of health sciences of ljubljana university study programme nursing and in the  faculty for education of ljubljana university study programme social pedagogy for developing mental health prevention and promotion educational programmes at undergraduate and at postgraduate level programmes and projects already described are not a part of regular curriculum and therefore not accessible to all children and adolescents similarly to other eu countries and us we witness in slovenia lack of resources for training and lack of working posts for prevention and promotion educational curricula do not follow quickly developing mental health promotion and prevention science and evidence this level of prevention is underdeveloped since slovenia’s health care system is still mainly oriented in treatment of diseases and we could hardly say that it is in its way to reorienting health care services towards more comprehensive  secondary level of prevention secondary level of prevention is to be performed by special units of community health centres majority of primary care physicians underwent additional educational programmes on recognizing depression and suiciudality and improved their diagnosis lack of human resources impedes the development and implementation of early recognition and treatment of mental disorders that proves to be most important preventive mental health tool as described in many documents and papers  there are around six socalled counselling centres for children adolescent and their parents in slovenia which offer different activities in the filed of mental health especially early diagnostic of mental health and learning problems individual and group therapy in these centres interdisciplinarity and muldisectoriality is a method of work with a child adolescent and their patent some of these centres are active also in the field of research education and prevention also there exist other activities which could be to the certain extent classified as secondary prevention  crisis telephone lines as for example “call in mental crisis” in slovene klic v duševni stiski could be seen as special form of secondary prevention this service seems to becoming more and more used also in slovenia and it is also increasingly reachable through information technology communication tertiary level of prevention psychiatric services before presenting the current situation of psychiatric services in slovenia we would like to present some historical points of view history of psychiatric services in slovenia the historical context of slovene psychiatry and psychiatric rehabilitation is important for understanding the development of mental health prevention in our country the beginnings of psychiatry in slovenian lands reach as far back as the year  when the first ward for mentally ill monks was established in the general hospital of ljubljana in  the first specialized ward for the treatment of the mentally ill was founded within the general hospital of ljubljana in  a large psychiatric hospital was built in the manner that was at the time regarded to be the right one outside the town in unspoiled nature and  tranquilizing greenery before the  slovenia had  bed per  population the german and postwar psychocide reduced the capacities by one half after the war and nowadays we made do with  psychiatric hospitals  including the university psychiatric hospital  and  beds per  population and the average hospital treatment period of  days during the second world war slovenia was occupied by nazigermany who in  enforced the socalled euthanasia programme with about  patients from one of the slovene psychiatric hospitals during the war the university psychiatric hospital in ljubljana helped the antinazi resistance in every possible way it also contributed by diagnosing antifascists who were in danger as mentally ill and hiding them among the “real” patients it offered medical help to wounded fighters of the resistance and helped antifascists escape the nazi controlled areas and join the resistance psychiatrists also tried to use “psychiatric diagnosis” to help a jewish family that tried to escape from croatian fascist ustasha across slovenia to italy two leading psychiatrists were liquidated by the occupator for their cooperation with the resistance the principal was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment many of the staff members were interned and some died in the liberation war it is a historical paradox that after the end of the war in slovenia psychocide went on for another ten years patients were treated so badly that the mortality was almost as high as it had been towards the end of the war ie about   due to famine and tuberculosis for hitler patients had been “lives unworthy of lives” for communists they were an obstacle on the way to better socialist future but in general the communist regime of exyugoslavia was much “softer” than those in other east european countries political intervention a case of intervention from the part of the communist authorities after the war was the following an internationally renowned author and politician fell from grace and became a kind of dissident he then fell ill with alzheimers disease and was hospitalized at the clinic for distinctively disturbed behaviour at the wish of his wife and children the authorities often inquired whether detention was still necessary and whether he could not have been taken care of outside the psychiatric clinic they were truly afraid of the reaction of the international public and the possible reproach that they used psychiatry to do away with political opponents personal communication with jože darovec former director of ljubljana psychiatric hospital  the practice of detention of “dangerous people” during foreign statesmen visits was abolished only in  by prof miloš kobal he was educated in great britain and used his experience from there  as well as his own ideas  for an extremely early reform of the slovenian psychiatry as early as   much earlier in fact than many other more developed european countries he diminished the number of beds by sending patients to other suitable institutions not to the streets like president j f kennedy and f basaglia in italy opened the majority of the uptothen closed wards founded the centre for mental health the day and night ward the family care within a family other than a patients own established specialized wards for the treatment of addictions in all psychiatric hospitals designed the dispensary psychiatric care introduced psychiatric counselling service in most old peoples homes and asylums introduced the longterm therapy by fluphenazine depot in  and the lithium therapy already in  personal communication with jože darovec   current state of psychiatric services psychiatric service is in slovenia given in all levels of health care system  primary mental health care acute treatment of all mental disorders is available at the primary health care level but in a limited way as described previously primary health care is delivered by community health care centres and private practitioners at the moment there is about  community health centres in slovenia some of community health care centres but not all unfortunately has specialized units called dispensaries – psychiatric dispensary for adults and mental hygiene dispensaries for children and adolescent the reorientation towards more comprehensive primary health service is questionable since it is under rapid transformation towards privatization  secondary and tertiary level of mental health care at the secondary and tertiary level of mental health care there are altogether six regional psychiatric hospitals including the university psychiatric hospital all have wards for general psychiatry psychogeriatrics and the treatment of alcohol dependency the university psychiatric hospital also has wards for adolescent psychiatry drug dependency and psychotherapy there is also the child psychiatry ward in the paediatric clinic in  the number of all psychiatric hospital beds was   about  beds have been allocated for child and adolescent psychiatry in the period  beds actually in use per  population all psychiatric inpatient institution decreased from  in  period to   there are  child and adolescent psychiatrists in the country hospital treatments are becoming shorter and more intensive with complementary services providing day hospitals and participation in selected activities for time limited follow up in table  psychiatric secondary and tertiary services

rehabilitation methods are developed in institutions and in the community and these systems are connecting themselves with the method of care planning this is achieved by communication among inpatient and community services as far as possible since there is no community psychiatric treatment available in slovenia yet except from an attempt of the psychiatric team in the central hospital to perform community psychiatric treatment these endeavours are sporadic and not available to everybody in need but rather exceptional and due to personal engagement of mental health workers the legislation and financing are however anyway being prepared and close to adoption right now in  in ljubljana the capital a rehabilitation unit of the psychiatric hospital was therefore established to follow up the patients with severe mental illness with high risk for relapse and dual diagnosis this service is well connected with nongovernmental ngos and social services as well as primary health care services these connections are widely used also by other hospital departments but nevertheless can not reply to the needs of patients and their families crisis interventions are organized by the central primary health care service providing urgent interventions this service need better collaboration with psychiatrists in the cases of involuntary referrals but this is not achieved because of lack of psychiatrists and other psychiatric personnel professional and user organizations and associations of interested experts have been founded for the group of patients with severe mental illness the largest are šent altra ozara and paradoks which are together with the psychiatric profession involved in preventive mainly antistigma programmes among the psychosocial services offered are housing facilities with support day centres vocational rehabilitation development sheltered employment and education for professionals patients and carers ngos providing support for people with anxiety depression substance abuse and dependence and for carers and families of people with dementia are emerging as well in last ten years with increasing influence to health and social policy the carers families organization has developed a network of interest for mental health prevention and promotion in slovenia at the level of republic and connected itself with international organizations of carers  here we will shortly introduce only two of ngos being šent and trading centres since detailed description of all of them is beyond the scope of this module  slovenian association for mental health šent šent is the largest nonprofit ngo in slovenia providing from  coordinated social care for patients with severe mental illness the difference to other ngos was at first acknowledging the need for coordination among psychiatric and social care services to improve quality and comprehensiveness of care for people in need the context of mutual respect provided grounds for quick and stable development of vocational rehabilitation education of patients families and professionals day centres and group homes all these services are intended for the group of patients users with disability due to mental illness and stigma and supported by carers and patients šent is today taking lead in anti stigmatization of mental illness education of professionals for newly emerging community psychiatry and community social work it provides also advocacy and self help groups mostly in day centres and among families of patients with severe mental illness the variety of needs opportunities and demands regarding mental health service development consumers’ movement legal and organizational issues provide a turbulent environment for continuous  development of this organization the programmes are comparable to other ngos listed above  trading centres for people with disabilities one of the rehabilitation initiatives is “trading centres for people with disabilities” one of the biggest trading companies in slovenia recently planned to implement a programme that would allow people with disabilities better access to their various facilities this programme labelled “kindly to disabled” focuses on all groups of people with disabilities including the physically disabled those with learning disabilities and people with disabilities caused by mental disorders the programme was developed in cooperation with slovenian association for mental health šent which provided counselling on the matter and education for employees about the needs of the disabled since the needs of different disabled groups are very different a series of adaptations including employees’ attitudes and communication skills was proposed beside technical adaptation of the shops’ environments this action seems to be becoming important preventive step for including the disabled in the society on equal terms the project should succeed because the disabled strongly participated in the assessment of the needed adaptations and in the education of the employees and employers results of some studies on mental health in slovenia there exist some different kinds of research on different aspects of mental disorders and their consequences the majority of programmes are evaluated regarding their efficiency in experimental circumstances among studies are following  delphi study on alcohol prevention in slovenia  alcohol abuse is an avoidable behaviour that can threaten health in slovenia only a few public campaigns against drinking alcohol are under way it is important to establish which community measures are acceptable to society in slovenia in order to reduce alcoholrelated risks this study was a delphi study with  professionals from different disciplines was conducted participants offered many suggestions to improve the current situation after three rounds of questionnaires  participant statements were accepted as a consensus results showed that actions such as state monopolies alcohol taxation legislative restrictions on availability and purchase of alcohol agerelated restriction on sales drinkdriving laws schoolbased alcohol education and media information campaigns are most likely to be achieved by consensus the main target populations for implementation of alcoholrelated educational programmes are children young people and employees the conclusions of this study were that as a result of the study a number of community actions against drinking alcohol that could be acceptable for society can now be suggested they vary across different target populations change agents individuals organizations and institutions and methods of implementation  outcome assessment   majority of longterm hospitalized patients with severe mental disorders considered resistant to standard hospital psychiatric treatment have been discharged during last decade from slovene psychiatric hospitals mainly due to economic pressure without any assessment of outcomes or patients’ needs rehabilitation unit has been established within university psychiatric hospital in ljubljana for inpatients with severe mental disorders the research was aimed at to find out characteristics and needs of patients with schizophrenia in order to develop hospital service in accordance with patients’ needs in the study fortyone longterm hospitalized and frequently admitted patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were followed through  months period by a public psychiatric hospital team due to discharge planning the patients were assessed regarding their needs clinical status global functioning and quality of life and thoroughly informed about their illness treatment and rehabilitation plan follow up assessments showed improvement in negative syndrome of schizophrenia better satisfaction in some areas of patients’ lives and a decrease in their needs in spite of considered resistance to standard hospital psychiatric treatment the study results prove rehabilitation programme to be successful for patients with severe mental disorders and present some information for further development of services for patients with severe mental disorders in slovenia  evaluation of stigma in slovenia there were several evaluations of attitudes of different groups toward people with mental disorders one of them is a study entitled ”does psychiatric education reduce stigma “ evaluation of discriminative attitudes of medical students towards people with mental disorders was evaluated by a questionnaire before and after the mental health curricula in several faculties that have mental health curricula the attitudes towards psychiatric patients didn’t change much after education except from lowering the level of fear perceived by students table  table  differences between students in discriminative attitudes towards people with mental disorders before the study of psychiatry and after the completion of the cycle of lectures and exercises in the year  variable they are dangerous they are incompetent i feel fear to meet them i feel reluctant to them i feel alienated to them n      mean           legend sd – standard deviation  sd           difference p           the attitudes of patients towards patients were also researched and showed higher discrimination scores among patients’ than in students’ group this was interpreted as self stigma but it might be better defined as an expressed reluctance to participate in the patients’ group which is characterised by extreme exclusion poverty and low life opportunities another study was undertaken by a medical student that organized a serial of films presentations of stories of people with different mental disorders the attitudes of student after these shows were somewhat better in certain areas of discrimination future steps for strengthening mental care in slovenia there are several challenges posed in front of public health and clinical sphere in the field of mental care in slovenia two of most important being • one challenge is of course adoption of mental health policy and national plan for mental health according to who  national mental health policies should not be solely concerned with mental health disorders but also recognize promotes mental health these would include the socioeconomic and environmental factors described above as well as behaviour policies for reduction of suicide anxiety and depression should develop evidence based approach towards improvement of early recognition of mental disorders with increasing sensibility of employers professional mental health workers and public about early recognition of warning signs of mental disorders suicidal behaviour recognizing triggers and circumstances connected with suicide dangerous behaviour and mental illness denmark for example achieved  reduction of suicide rate with combination of policies and preventive programmes in last  years among these are reduces access to suicidal means weapons with better treatment of somatic and mental disorders after suicide attempts with improved access to telephone counselling and emergency psychiatry and with increase in social and cultural stability  • another challenge is to reorient mental care towards more comprehensive one with more emphasis on mental health promotion and mental disorders prevention mental health promotion should be mainstreamed into policies and programmes in government and business sectors including education labour justice transport environment housing and welfare as well as the health sector particularly important are the decisionmakers in governments at local and national levels whose actions affect mental health in ways that they may not realize  one of the biggest challenges facing slovenia at the moment in the area of health promotion is increasing concern among both the general public and among experts and professionals about mental health  slovenia should build a strong network of experts institutions and consumers organizations that are responsible in the field of mental health promotion and prevention to intensify effects there is a need to harmonize programmes with a long term vision making them concrete through actions across different settings at different levels pointed to different target groups   exercise task  make a medline search on medical studentsstigmamental illness choose several most cited articles and try to propose a model for reducing discrimination in this group for your country task  search for available needs assessment mental health questionnaire and list it use the most cited one and exercise its implementation with a close person without diagnosis task  make a list of needed mental health services in your local area and try to explain your decisions task  design a substance abuse prevention programme for your local community acknowledgement the authors thank nuša konec juričič md specialist of social medicine on the

mental health services after completing this module students and public health professionals should • be aware of the mental health as a communitys public health problem • recognize the main determinants of mental health • understand the way public health can contribute to mental health improvement • have increased knowledge on the types of mental health services • identify the steps to be taken for developing community mental health services mental health is considered a public health problem due to the following particularities of the mental diseases high incidence and prevalence long term duration with consequences over family social and professional life cause severe disability high cost imposed on individual family and community associated stigma and discrimination the main determinants of mental health are socioeconomic demographic and psychological factors public health can bring a major contribution to the improvement of mental health by its main functions such as needs evaluation priority setting policy development health promotion and disease prevention mental health services research and development according to who recommendations mental health services should be organized based on principles of accessibility coordinated care continuity of care effectiveness equity and respect for human rights as well mental health care should be provided through general health services and community settings large and centralized psychiatric institutions need to be replaced by other more appropriate mental health services the shifting of patients from mental hospitals to care in the community should be based primarily on the existence of a mental health policy that promotes the development of communitybased care policies should be drawn up with the  involvement of all stakeholders and should be based upon uptodate and reliable information mental health policy and service provision should take into account the context of general health systems organization and financing for a successful implementation of the mental health policy political legislative financial and administrative support is required teaching methods specific recommendations for teachers assessment of students teaching methods include lectures group discussions group exercises role playing the students will be split in three groups and asked to work on three different subjects for undertaking a situation analysis the students will do a role play having assigned different roles in a ‘working group’ policymakers health professionals patients family members ngos and other interested parties appointed to formulate a mental health policy that includes development of communitybased care and to plan for a community mental health service  work under teacher

life silvia gabriela scintee adriana galan theroretical background  mental health – a community’s public health problem in the world health report   mental health new understanding new hope world health organization is making the following statement mental health – neglected for far too long – is crucial to the overall wellbeing of individuals societies and countries and must be universally regarded in a new light  mental health deserves special attention and it is considered a public health problem due to the following particularities of the mental diseases − high incidence and prevalence of the  million people living in the european region at any one time about  million people are estimated to suffer from anxiety and depression over  million to suffer from alcohol use disorders over  million from alzheimer’s disease and other dementias about  million from schizophrenia  million from bipolar affective disorder and  million from panic disorders  − long term duration with consequences over family social and professional life neuropsychiatric disorders also account for over  of chronic diseases in many countries mental health problems account for – of absenteeism from work  − cause severe disability it was estimated that in  mental and neurological disorders accounted for  of the total daly’s lost due to all diseases and injuries this was  in  by  it is projected that the burden of these disorders will have increased to   − high cost imposed on individual family and community there are very few studies that estimate the aggregate economic costs of mental disorders who  world health report quotes one such study rice et al  that concluded that the aggregate yearly cost for the united states accounted for about  of gross national product a study from the netherlands that has estimated expenditure on mental disorders as  of all health service costs meerding et al  and a study in the united kingdom that found that inpatient expenditure only was  patel  knapp  indirect costs arising from productivity loss account for a larger proportion of overall costs than direct costs however all the estimates of economic evaluations are most certainly underestimates since lost opportunity costs to individuals and families are not taken into account  − associated stigma and discrimination because of this stigma people with mental disorders experience limitations in employment education and housing this in turn affects their ability to gain access to appropriate care integrate into society and recover from their illness    main determinants of mental health as known the health status of a population is determined by a biological factors b environmental factors economical social and physical c lifestyle behavioural and cultural factors and d health care systems the main determinants of mental health are socioeconomic demographic and psychological factors  socioeconomical factors public health literature shows with evidence based arguments that the main determinants of poor health are poverty and inequity furthermore poverty and associated conditions of unemployment low educational level deprivation and homelessness are not influencing mental health only in poor countries but also affect a sizeable minority of rich countries data from crossnational surveys in poor countries brazil chile india and zimbabwe shows that common mental disorders are about twice as frequent among the poor as among the rich in the united states children from the poorest families were found to be at increased risk of disorders in the ratio of  for behavioural disorders and  for comorbid conditions  the poverty determines not only the onset but the evolution of psychiatric disorders as well the stigma attached to mental diseases creates a vicious cycle of alienation and discrimination – leading to social isolation inability to work alcohol or drug abuse homelessness or excessive institutionalization – which decreases the chance of recovery and normal life  demographical factors gender in general the behavioural and mental disorders affect equally the both sexes there are sex differences on each diagnostic category thus the depressive and anxiety disorders are more frequent in women while substance abuse and antisocial personality disorders are more common in men  among the reasons of higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in women there are hormonal changes as part of the reproductive life cycle the social role of the women that burdens them with higher responsibilities and exposes them to greater stress high rates of domestic violence and sexual violence against women high prevalence of physical disorders among women age mental disorders have a high prevalence among children and adolescents the most frequent disorders in children are the impairments or delays in the development of specific functions such speech dyslexia or overall pervasive development autism a high prevalence of mental disorders is also seen in old age especially for dementia and depression thus the increase in life expectancy of persons with mental disorders as well as the increasing number of persons who reach an age for which the risk of developing a mental disorder is higher determines a high prevalence of the psychiatric pathology urbanization this process is accompanied by increased homelessness poverty higher levels of pollution overcrowding violence rapid technological change and disruption in the family structures and loss of social support – factors that have a negative impact on mental health    psychological factors individual factors the presence of a serious physical disorder may affect the mental health of individual as well as of entire families because of psychosocial consequences such as an infirmity ie surgical removal of one breast or stigma and discrimination aids other individual factors refer to the different life events either positive such as unexpected substantial gains a great success or negative professional failures losses or even life change events job or professional responsibilities change migration familial factors unstable or disrupted family environments have a role in the outset and the evolution of mental disorders a well known example is the concept of ‚expressed emotions’ studied in the families of patients with schizophrenia ‚expressed emotions’ in these studies have included critical comments hostility emotional overinvolvement and warmth  as well family life events such as changes in family structure a serious disease or disability of a family member are affecting mental health environmental factors mental disorders are firmly rooted in the social environment of the individual at both microgroup level and the whole society level at the microgroup level the person could be affected by conflictual relationships or negative life events such as the disease the death the injustices or losses suffered by the members of the group friends relatives colleagues neighbours etc at the whole society level the wars civil wars natural disasters can traumatize entire populations and the effects are higher in the less developed countries with less problems solving capacity  even if the biological factors the factors from the physical environment and the health care systems have a smaller influence on the onset of the mental disorders these are not to be neglected almost all of the common severe mental and behavioural disorders are associated with a significant genetic component of risk as the many other physical illnesses the mental disorders are the result of a complex interaction of two or more factors  the contribution of public health to a better mental health of the community public health can bring a major contribution to the improvement of mental health by its main functions such as needs evaluation priority setting policy development health promotion and disease prevention mental health services research and development  needs evaluation and development of policies addressed to the priority problems until not so long accurate evaluation of the mental health status has been impeded on one hand by the difficulties in defining and identifying the mental disorders and on the other hand by the inadequacy of data collection systems advances during recent decades in standardizing clinical assessment made possible as mental disorders to be diagnosed as reliably and accurately as most of the common physical disorders structured interview schedules and diagnostic symptomsign checklists allow mental health professionals to collect information using standard questions and pre  coded responses the symptoms and signs have been defined in detail to allow for uniform application finally diagnostic criteria for disorders have been standardized internationally  data on mental health status of a population is not usually found in the routine statistical records and specially designed epidemiological and medicosocial surveys are necessary in order to get information on the incidence and prevalence of mental disorders besides information on mental health diseases information on major determinants of mental health and health care systems are necessary in order to identify priority problems and to formulate policies to address these problems in fulfilling its role of technical adviser to the member states in mental health related matters world health organization noticed that there was not enough information on mental health especially on the available resources to alleviate the mental health problems thus in  the world health organization launched the project atlas to address this gap the objectives of this project include the collection compilation and dissemination of relevant information about mental health resources in different countries the first set of publications from the project appeared in  and the second editions with updated information in  one significant addition in  was the inclusion of information on epidemiology of mental disorders for all low and middle income countries emphasizing the necessity of a wellfunctioning and coordinated information system for measuring a minimum number of mental health indicators for both the formulation and evaluation of policies on mental health world health organization mentions monitoring of community mental health among the ten recommendations for action in its world health report   mental health new understanding new hope   health promotion and disease prevention taking into account the high economic and social costs of mental diseases for the society mental health promotion and mental disorders prevention have a tremendous importance mental health promotion strategies have also a positive impact on other problems such as delinquency among youngsters school abandon and violence against children these strategies should take into account both the community needs and the social and cultural environments mental health promotion strategies could be classified in three main categories   interventions targeting factors determining or maintaining illhealth as an example – programmes that enhance the quality of childrenparents relationship given the fact that psychological and cognitive development of children depend upon the interaction of the children with their parents  interventions targeting population groups a population group that might need such programmes are elderly by  there will be  billion people in the world who are over  years of age close to threequarters of them in the developing world which represent an important determinant of mental health disorders increase  interventions targeting particular settings an example could be school targeted programmes besides family the school is crucial in preparing the children for life thus schools should teach lifeskills such as problem solving critical thinking empathy communication skills interpersonal  relations development and methods to cope with emotions as well schools should offer a friendly environment where the tolerance the equality between sexes ethnical social or religious groups the creativity the selfesteem and selfconfidence should be encouraged mental health prevention could be done at three levels  primary prevention is predominantly targeted to the mental health determinants and avoids the diseases development reducing in this way the incidence of the diseases community based primary prevention programmes can bring a huge contribution to the wellbeing of individuals by controlling mental health determinants that action at community level  secondary prevention has the purpose of early detection of diseases arrest the disease evolution avoid further complications and sequelae and limit disability through cure and reduction of disease duration secondary prevention reduces the prevalence of the diseases even if the main contribution belongs to the psychiatric services the primary health care services or services provided at the community level can help by early detection of the diseases and by monitoring the treatment prescribed by specialists  tertiary prevention reduces the handicap helps the socioprofessional recovery assures the independence and selfsatisfaction on the quality of life of the individual it comprises both interventions at the level of the individual and modifications of the environment the best interventions are the integrated tertiary prevention programmes in which community participates covering the social needs of the individuals  mental health services research and development mental health services have some particularities that make them different primarily in many countries they are not integrated in the general health services mental disorders are common and most patients are only seen in primary care but their disorders are often not detected as the medical team from the primary care level is not trained in detection of mental disorders the prejudice towards mental health service users together with the silent debut of mental diseases keeps a low level of addressability to mental health services as well denying their disease the patients do not address to health services until their disease is too serious and they need hospital care numerous studies show that rates of service utilization by people with mental health problems remain low for instance in the netherlands more than  per cent of people with bipolar disorder are estimated not to come into contact with mental health services the esemed study european study of the epidemiology of mental disorders covering six european countries belgium france germany italy the netherlands and spain concluded that there was insufficient use of both general and specialist mental health services relative to the prevalence of mental health problems in the population with only one in four people in need coming into contact with services although contact rates were higher for some problems such as mood disorders  for this reason the active detection of the mental diseases is very important a broad range of ingredients of care are requested to meet both medical and social needs of people with mental disabilities including medication psychotherapy  psychosocial rehabilitation vocational rehabilitation employment housing etc as well mental health services can be effective only when provided within a multidisciplinary care team psychiatrist psychologist social worker etc the complex needs of many persons with mental disorders cannot be met by the health sector alone intersectoral collaboration is therefore essential collaboration is needed both within the health sector intrasectoral collaboration and outside the health sector intersectoral collaboration  decentralization and health financing reforms have largely been driven by a desire to improve access to health care advance equity in health service provision and promote the use of costeffective technologies so as to obtain the best possible health outcomes for populations on the other hand financing reforms have also been seen by governments as a method of controlling the cost of providing health care and spreading the cost to other players especially the users of services health financing reforms include changes in revenue collection based on the concept of pooling and reforms in the purchasing of health services however general health reforms might have negative impact on mental health the fragmentation and exclusion of services for people with mental disorders through decentralization increased outofpocket payments that would harm the interests of people with mental disorders as they are unlikely to have the resources to pay for services exclusion from the treatment for mental disorders by introduction of pooling systems such as public and private insurance schemes  worldwide outofpocket payment is the most important method for financing mental health care in  of who member countries in  of who member countries the most important method is tax based in  of countries social insurance in  of countries private insurance and in  of countries external grants from international organizations and other countries in the european region social insurance is the primary method of financing in  of countries outofpocket payment is the second most used method of financing mental health care in  of countries in the european region  mental health services are widely underfunded especially in developing countries nearly  of who member countries do not have separate budgets for mental health of the countries that have such budgets  spend less than  of their health budgets on mental health expenditure on mental health amounts to under  of the health budgets in  of developing countries and  of developed countries thus there is a significant discrepancy between the burden of mental disorders and the resources dedicated to mental health services  in order to properly finance the mental health system decision makers should find ways to mobilize sufficient funds should use economic research methods to identify how the funds should be allocated to cover the needs and to find cost control tools   mental health care in community based services the provision of mental health care in community settings has been highly debated in the last two decades the starting point was the discontent with the long term care hospitals long term hospitalization was held accountable by progressive loss of life skills and accumulation of “deficit symptoms” or “institutionalism” other concerns included repeated cases of illtreatment to patients the geographical and professional isolation of institutions and their staffs poor reporting and accounting procedures  failures of management leadership and administration insufficient finances ineffective staff training and inadequate inspection and quality assurance measures the resulting response was deinstitutionalization  as there was no scientific evidence that community services alone can provide satisfactory comprehensive care the best alternative was considered a balanced care model balanced care is essentially communitybased but hospitals play an important backup role this means that mental health services are provided in normal community settings close to the population served and hospital stays are as brief as possible arranged promptly and employed only when necessary the balanced care approach seeks to provide services that  − are close to home including modern hospitals for acute admissions and longterm residential facilities in the community − are mobile including services that provide home treatment − address disabilities as well as symptoms − provide treatment and care specific to the diagnosis and needs of each individual − adhere to international conventions on human rights − reflect the priorities of the service users themselves and − are coordinated among mental health care providers and agencies  types of mental health services according to who recommendations mental health services should be organized based on principles of accessibility coordinated care continuity of care effectiveness equity and respect for human rights as well mental health care should be provided through general health services and community settings large and centralized psychiatric institutions need to be replaced by other more appropriate mental health services who does not make any recommendation on a specific model for organizing mental health services the organization and delivery should take into account the country’s social cultural political and economic context the various components of mental health services are grouped in three main categories services integrated to the general health system community services and institutional services   mental health services integrated into the general health system mental health services in primary care include preventive and curative services and it is delivered by primary care professionals general practitioners nurses community health workers and other health staff based in primary care clinics this requires significant investment in training primary care professionals to detect and treat mental disorders furthermore primary care staff should have the time to conduct mental health interventions clinical outcomes of primary care integrated mental health services depends on the knowledge and skills of primary care staff in diagnosing and treating common mental disorders as well as on the availability of drugs and of psychosocial treatment primary care services are easily accessible and are generally better accepted than other forms of service delivery by persons with mental health disorders this is mainly attributable to the reduced stigma associated with seeking help from such services both providers and users generally find these services inexpensive in comparison with other mental health services  mental health services in general hospitals include certain services offered in district general hospitals and academic or central hospitals that form part of the general health system such services include psychiatric inpatient wards psychiatric beds in general wards and emergency departments and outpatient clinics there may also be some specialist services eg for children adolescents and the elderly these services are provided by specialist mental health professionals such as psychiatrists psychiatric nurses psychiatric social workers psychologists the clinical outcomes associated with these services are variable and depend on their quality and quantity mental health services based in general hospitals are usually well accepted because general hospitals are usually located in large urban centres however there may be problems of accessibility in countries lacking good transport systems for service providers mental health services in general hospitals are likely to be more expensive than services provided in primary care but less expensive than those provided in specialized institutions service users also have to incur additional travel and time costs that can create additional access barriers in some countries  community mental health services formal community mental health services include communitybased rehabilitation service hospital diversion programmes mobile crisis teams therapeutic and residential supervised services home help and support services and communitybased services for special populations such as trauma victims children adolescents and the elderly community mental health services need close working links with general hospitals and mental hospitals with primary care services and informal care providers working in the community these services require some staff with a high level of skills and training although many functions can be delivered by general health workers with some training in mental health community mental health services provide an opportunity for many persons with severe mental disorders to continue living in the community and thus promote community integration high levels of satisfaction with community mental health services are associated with their accessibility a reduced level of stigma associated with helpseeking for mental disorders and a reduced likelihood of violations of human rights informal community mental health services may be provided by local community members other than general health professionals or dedicated mental health professionals and paraprofessionals informal providers are a useful complement to formal mental health services and can be important in improving the outcomes of persons with mental disorders such service providers usually have high acceptability and there are few access barriers as the providers are nearly always based in the communities they serve  institutional mental health services specialist institutional mental health services are provided by outpatient clinics and public or private hospitalbased facilities that offer various services in inpatient wards among the services there are those provided by acute and high security units units for children and elderly people and forensic psychiatry units specialist services are usually tertiary referral centres and patients who are difficult to treat make up a large proportion of their caseloads if well funded and well resourced they provide care of high quality and produce outcomes that are good enough to justify their continuation nearly all specialist services have problems of access associated with a  lack of availability with location in urban centres that have inadequate transport links and with stigma attached to seeking help from such services specialist services are costly to set up and maintain mainly because of the high level of investment in infrastructure and staff dedicated mental hospitals mainly provide longstay custodial services in many parts of the world they are either the only mental health services or remain a substantial component of such services mental hospitals are frequently associated with poor outcomes attributable to a combination of factors such as poor clinical care violations of human rights the nature of institutionalized care and a lack of rehabilitative activities stigma associated with mental hospitals also reduces their acceptability and accessibility  community care based mental health services community mental health services can include a wide array of settings and different levels of care provided by mental health professionals and paraprofessionals usually working in multidisciplinary teams  examples of services provided in community care settings are presented below communitybased rehabilitation and treatment programmes  aiming to assist people with mental disorders to live a full community life there are many models of communitybased service provision such as case management hospital diversion programmes intensive home support and outreach services in the case management model each patient is allocated a ‘case manager’ who assesses the patient’s needs develops a care plan offers linkages with the care providers and advocacy intensive case management services can be provided for a short period during a crisis in order to avoid or prevent hospitalization hospital diversion programme specialist mental health services for treatment and care of people with severe mental health problems in the community specialist teams need to be organized examples are specialist community services to care for people with severe problems such as schizophrenia bipolar affective disorder dementia and severe depression these services need to be accessible  hours a day  days a week and should comprise multidisciplinary staff housing services include supported residential and emergency housing  supported housing ensures the provision of affordable accommodation and a range of supporting services enabling patients able to live independently to maintain their living arrangements residential housing enables patients that cannot live independently to acquire skills and confidence in a group setting in order to maximize their independence emergency housing provides services to homeless patients who require intensive stabilization but no hospitalization crisis intervention services need to be provided in association with primary care providers who are usually the first “port of call” in a crisis this requires good referral and linkage systems with primary care services as well as with mental health services in general hospitals in some countries community mental health teams also provide homebased intensive crisis intervention services through mobile and outreach crisis teams hospital diversion programmes in other countries try to divert people in crisis from a hospital admission to other communitybased facilities such as crisis shelters  education and training community mental health services are usually involved in education and training of staff for their own services as well as of primary health care staff and mental health professionals working in general hospitals community mental health services need to develop good intersectoral collaboration because people with mental disorders have complex needs that cut across service sectors links need to be established with primary health care services and with services provided through general hospital settings community mental health services need to participate in research especially in the area of service delivery for example by investigating the effectiveness of different models of service delivery community mental health services have firsthand knowledge of delivering communitybased services and this can usefully feed into the framing of research priorities and questions people with mental disorders have multiple needs related to health welfare employment housing criminal justice and education for these reasons community mental health services need to work collaboratively with other sectors and establish clear referral pathways mutual supervision and training all these services could be combined in different community mental health care models from country to country depending on various factors including the sociocultural context how national health services are organized and the availability of financial and human resources  developing community mental health services community care facilities exist in only  of who member countries covering  of the world’s population across different income groups community care facilities in mental health are present in  of the low income countries and in  of the high income countries there were also significant differences between income group and the presence of community care facilities within countries  currently  of countries in europe do not have any communitybased mental health services there is wide variability according to levels of economic development only  of lowincome european countries have communitybased mental health services whereas  of highincome countries have such services among those countries that do report having community services the actual extent of service coverage also varies widely  recent developments in the understanding treatment and care of people with mental disorders have shown that the most effective care of people with mental disorders is provided at community level the importance of the community for mental health is highlighted by the world health organization in the world health report   mental health new understanding new hope where  out of  recommendations refer directly to the community  − give care in the community  ‘community care has a better effect than institutional treatment on the outcome and quality of life of individuals with chronic mental disorders shifting patients from mental hospitals to care in the community is also costeffective and respects human rights mental health services should therefore be provided in the community with the use of all available resources communitybased services can lead to early intervention and limit the stigma of taking treatment large custodial mental hospitals should be replaced by community care facilities backed by general hospital  psychiatric beds and home care support which meet all the needs of the ill that were the responsibility of those hospitals this shift towards community care requires health workers and rehabilitation services to be available at community level along with the provision of crisis support protected housing and sheltered employment’ − involve communities families and consumers  ‘communities families and consumers should be included in the development and decisionmaking of policies programmes and services this should lead to services being better tailored to people’s needs and better used in addition interventions should take account of age sex culture and social conditions so as to meet the needs of people with mental disorders and their families’ − monitor community mental health  the mental health of communities should be monitored by including mental health indicators in health information and reporting systems the indices should include both the numbers of individuals with mental disorders and the quality of their care as well as some more general measures of the mental health of communities such monitoring helps to determine trends and to detect mental health changes resulting from external events such as disasters monitoring is necessary to assess the effectiveness of mental health prevention and treatment programmes and it also strengthens arguments for the provision of more resources new indicators for the mental health of communities are necessary’ the shifting of patients from mental hospitals to care in the community should be based primarily on the existence of a mental health policy that promotes the development of communitybased care policies should be drawn up with the involvement of all stakeholders and should be based upon uptodate and reliable information concerning the community mental health indicators effective treatments prevention and promotion strategies and mental health resources mental health policy and service provision should take into account the context of general health systems organization and financing an analysis of the data gathered by project atlas  shows that only  of who member countries accounting for  of the population have a mental health policy in european region  of countries have a mental health policy most countries that report having a policy also have all the essential components incorporated into them treatment prevention rehabilitation promotion and advocacy intersectoral collaboration collaboration with ngos provision of social assistance human resource development improvement of community care facilities especially for the underserved are some of the other components also included in the policies of some countries the project atlas does not have data on the degree in which these policies are implemented for a successful implementation of the mental health policy political legislative financial and administrative support is required necessary investments have to be made in buildings staff training and the provision of backup facilities monitoring and evaluation are important aspects of change planning and evaluation should go hand in hand and evaluation should wherever possible have an epidemiological basis the policy will need to be reviewed periodically to allow for the modification or updating of programmes   the main principles that should guide the development of community mental health care services are accessibility comprehensiveness coordination and continuity of care effectiveness equity and respect for the human rights  the development of community mental health services should take into account the comprehensive and locally based provision of treatment and care accessible to patients and their families services should be comprehensive in that they provide a range of facilities to meet the mental health needs of the population if reshaping of large hospitals is envisaged developing of community services should come first deinstitutionalization can proceed in stages once communitybased alternatives are in place and all the functions of the institution are reproduced in the community planning for community mental health services should not be an isolated process service planners have to determine the exact mix of different types of mental health services and the level of provision of particular service delivery channels no matter how developed a community care network is in place there will always be a need for longstay facilities for an extremely small proportion of patients however most of these patients can be accommodated in small units located in the community approximating community living as far as possible or alternatively in small longstay wards in hospitals that also provide other specialist services  as the complex needs of many persons with mental disorders cannot be met by the health sector alone intersectoral collaboration should therefore be taken into consideration both within the health sector and outside the health sector also financing issues should be considered primarily the general health financing system should be well understood as even in the countries in which mental health financing is not distinct of the general health financing it is shaped or determined by this in order to understand the level of current resources and how they are used the entire mental health system should be mapped and the resource base for mental health services should be identified as well as the allocation strategies the selection of method for purchasing mental health services should take into account the increase of effectiveness and efficiency in services provision exercise task  – situation analysis the students will be split in three groups and asked to work on the following subjects − analyse the national mental health policy − analyse the country’s general health system organization and financing degree of decentralization − analyse the country’s mental health system organization and financing human resources task  – community mental health services development the students will do a role play having assigned different roles in a ‘working group’ policymakers health professionals patients family members ngos and other interested parties appointed to formulate a mental health policy that includes development of communitybased care and to plan for a community mental health service focusing on the following issues − what needs should be covered  − − − − what services will be provided what investments are necessary where the money will come from what would be the implementation strategy references  world

based on seminar paper and oral exam  hospital in meeting comprehensive health goals mitja košnik jerneja farkašlainščak theoretical background basics of health promotion health promotion is defined as the process of enabling people to increase control over and improve their health  health promotion goes beyond health education and disease prevention in as far as it is based on the concept of salutogenesis and stresses the analysis and development of the health potential of individuals  health in this context not only refers to the traditional objective and biomedical view of the absence of infirmity or disease but to a holistic view that adds mental resources and social wellbeing to physical health   the statement of principles known as the ottawa charter for health promotion  developed by the world health organization who in  is internationally accepted as the guiding framework for health promotion activity settings approach to health promotion based on the notion of health as a positive concept the ottawa charter for health promotion put forward the idea that health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life this settings approach to health promotion founded on the experience of community and organizational development led to a number of initiatives such as healthy cities health promoting schools health promoting workplaces health promoting hospitals hph etc in order to improve people’s health where they spend most of their time  the settings approach acknowledges that behavioural changes are only possible and stable if they are integrated into everyday life and correspond with concurrent habits and existing cultures  development of the health promoting hospitals concept twenty years ago who initiated hph movement in order to support hospitals towards placing greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention rather than on diagnostic and curative services alone the hph strategy focuses on four areas promoting the health of patients promoting the health of staff changing the organization to a health promoting setting and promoting the health of the community in the catchments area of the hospital  these four areas are reflected in the definition of a hph which states that hph does not only provide high quality comprehensive medical and nursing services but also develops a corporate identity that embraces the aims of health promotion develops a health promoting organizational structure and culture including active participatory roles for patients and all members of staff develops itself into a health promoting physical environment and actively cooperates with its community   promoting the health of patients health professionals in hospitals can have a lasting impact on influencing the behaviour of patients and relatives who are more responsive to health advice in situations of experienced disease  this is of particular importance for two reasons firstly the prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing in europe and throughout the world  secondly many hospital treatments today not only prevent premature death but improve the quality of life of patients  in order to maintain this quality the patient’s own behaviour after discharge and effective support from relatives are important variables therefore one of the hphs priorities is to encourage healthy behaviour prevent readmissions and maintain quality of life of patients  promoting the health of staff paradoxically in hospitals – organizations that aim to restore health – the acknowledgement of factors that endanger the health of their staff is poorly developed  these working places most of which are occupied by women are characterized by certain physical chemical biological and psychosocial risk factors with the increasing lack and migration of health professionals hospitals have to compete for the best staff hospitals that offer a safe and health promoting working environment and that involve staff in creating such an environment will be more successful to attract recruit and retain staff  health promotion programmes can improve the health of staff reduce costly shortterm absenteeism rates and improve productivity and quality  changing the organization to a health promoting setting and promoting the health of the local community hospitals also typically produce high amounts of waste and hazardous substances introducing health promotion strategies in hospitals can help reduce the pollution of the environment and the cooperation with other institutions and professionals can help achieve the highest possible coordination of care furthermore as research and teaching institutions hospital produce accumulate and disseminate a lot of knowledge and they can have an impact on the local health structures and influence professional practice elsewhere  in this context hospitals are expected to expand their role beyond the curative services to a proacting vehicle for health improvement towards this aim hph target the health of individuals staff patients local community population but they promote the health of their organization as well by creating a sustainable organization capable of confronting today’s challenges  evolution of the international network of health promoting hospitals a first connection between hospitals and health promotion appeared at the end of the s when health promotion and disease prevention came up in the united states as additional professional services provided by the hospital  in order to support the introduction of health promotion programmes in hospitals the who regional office for europe started the first international consultations in  in the subsequent year the who model project »health and hospital« was initiated with the rudolfstiftung  hospital in vienna as a partner institution  after this phase of consultation and experimenting the hph movement went into its developmental phase being marked by the initiation of the european pilot hospital project by the who regional office for europe in  this phase which lasted from  to  involved intensive monitoring of the development of projects in  partner hospitals from  european countries austria czech republic france germany united kingdom greece hungary ireland italy poland and sweden  subsequent to the closing of this pilot phase national and regional networks were developed and the network reached its consolidation phase since then national and regional networks take an important role in encouraging the cooperation and exchange of experience between hospitals of a region or a country including the identification of areas of common interest the sharing of resources and the development of common evaluation systems the international network of hph acts as a network of networks linking all national andor regional networks it supports the exchange of ideas and strategies implemented in different cultures and health care systems developing knowledge on strategic issues and enlarging the vision nowadays the international network of hph comprises  member states  national andor regional networks and more than  hospitals  many more countries and hospitals are regularly participating in the annual international hph conferences which have been organized since  in warsaw padova linköping londonderry vienna darmstadt swansea athens copenhagen bratislava florence moscow dublin lithuania vienna and  in   berlin a semiannual hph newsletter has been issued also since  in addition to the national andor regional networks specific hph task forces put efforts into further developing the hph concept for specific thematic areas or for specific hospital types eg health promoting psychiatric health care services health promotion for children and adolescents in the hospital migrant friendly and culturally competent hospitals putting hph policy into action  hph core strategies standards for hph and qualitybased reimbursement  the hph network is currently developing into an international association it is governed by an elected international governance board and has a general assembly meeting once a year the secretariat is based at the who collaborating centre for evidence based health promotion in hospitals in copenhagen  the international hph conferences the international hph newsletter and other scientific and technical functions are supported by the who collaborating centre for health promotion in hospitals and health care which is situated in vienna  subsequently the progress of hph has resulted in a series of influential reports that include the budapest declaration on health promoting hospitals the ljubljana charter on reforming health care and the vienna recommendations on health promoting hospitals  the latest document forms the set of principles on which the hph concept is based according to them a hph should  promote human dignity equity solidarity and professional ethics acknowledging differences in needs values and culture of different population groups  be oriented towards quality improvement the wellbeing of patients relatives and staff protection of the environment and realization of the potential to become a learning organization  focus on health with a holistic approach and not only on curative services   be centred on people providing health services in the best way possible for patients and relatives to facilitate the healing process and contribute to the empowerment of patients  use resources efficiently costeffectively and allocate resources on the basis of contribution to health improvement  form as close link as possible with other levels of the health care system and the community  standards and core strategies for health promoting hospitals the need for and the relevance of setting standards for health promotion in hospitals was realized in the international network of hph over a year period a set of standards was developed in order to make the standards applicable and acceptable in all hospitals and in order to make it possible to integrate the standards in existing quality standards for hospitals as established by several international and national quality and accreditation organizations  the standards have now been through a pilot test which has confirmed that they are understandable meaningful relevant and applicable international quality organizations are encouraged to integrate the standards in their already established sets of standards and in the future use of the standards the final set of five standards concern management policy patient assessment patient information and intervention promoting a healthy workplace and continuity and cooperation  the standards relate to patient pathways and define responsibilities and activities concerning health promotion as an integrated part of all services offered to patients in every hospital each standard consists of a standard formulation objective and definition of sub standards  in  who launched a working group to develop an uptodate strategic framework for hph since the situation of hospitals is characterized by a permanent and increasing pressure of their dynamic environments to adapt to changing political and economic professional and consumer expectations concerning the process and content of hospital services two general tendencies can be distinguished within the trend of hospital reforms  strategic repositioning of the hospital with the need to redefine the range and mix of services ie the distinction between core business and other services balancing inpatientoutpatient services or acutechronicrehabilitative services inclusion of educative elements specialization of types of hospitals and departments and integration with primary care and social services and intersectoral collaboration  assuring and improving quality of services ie to improve the safety appropriateness effectiveness and efficiency of services and improve satisfaction of stakeholders introducing different quality approaches accreditation and put a stronger emphasis on evidence based medicine and patient’s rights  to be able to identify the specific contributions of health promotion to such strategic repositioning and quality improvement in hospitals six general  strategies for the three target groups patients staff and the community were introduced table  table  six general health promotion strategies for each group of stakeholders patients staff and the community health promotion strategies  health promotion quality development of treatment and care by empowerment of stakeholders for health promoting selfcareselfreproduction  health promotion quality development of treatment and care by empowerment of stakeholders for health promoting coproduction  health promotion quality development for health promoting and empowering hospital setting for stakeholders  provision of specific health promotion services – empowering illness management patient education for stakeholders  provision of specific health promotion services – empowering lifestyle development health education for stakeholders  provision of specific health promotion activities – participation in health promoting and empowering community development for stakeholders service oriented strategies include quality improvement of already existing clinical and hotel services strategies   or strategies introducing new primarily educative services with midterm or longterm health effects strategies   strategies can be distinguished according to their orientation of treating or managing specific diseases strategies   and strategies oriented at services for maintaining or improving positive health strategies   concerning settings strategies developing the hospital setting itself strategy  can be distinguished from strategies of participation of the hospital in developing the community setting strategy  or other settings within the community eg workplaces or schools by being oriented at improving health gain and not just clinical outcome these six strategies do not only apply to patients and their relatives but in a somewhat modified way also to staff and members of the community the hospital serves and is situated in resulting in eighteen core strategies for health promotion in hospitals   dilemmas facing health promoting hospitals the main perceived barriers faced in the development of hph are shortages of funds personnel time management and professional skills the who refers to the fact that most health professionals in the hospital setting do not readily associate health promotion as part of their role  in the past the projects carried out within the hph network were characterized by a more traditional focus on health education interventions for patients and to a lesser extent for staff  similar problems to those stated above can be found throughout the hph movement in the hph network progress reports  nearly all of the european member states report commonly encountered problems this is not surprising however and perhaps inevitable given that many european countries stress the lack of governmentrelated policy support lack of individual organizational management commitment and lack of resources set aside for health promotion in hospitals  perhaps the main driver for hph reform  in europe is the capacity for hospitals to affect and influence public health reform and therefore directly influence the health of their surrounding communities hospitals and their leaders are being held increasingly accountable for the health status of local populations  this represents the greatest challenge for the hph movement and perhaps its biggest failure to date a broader vision would see the development of not just what could be termed as hph but institutions that could be classified as public health hospitals a public health hospital is one that develops its staff to move away from increasing medicalized subspecialization to an increasing understanding of the wider health agenda  it does this as part of a health promoting capacitybuilding process that leads to an organization’s overall structural development as well as offering a support structure for wider community health promotion initiatives through collaboration with public health agencies  tountas and colleagues reported that effective planning of hospital health promotion activities is required so that the daily routine is not interrupted besides of personnel shortage and lack of funding lack of health promotion background was found to be perceived as a significant problem  on the other hand polluste and colleagues compared the implementation of health promoting and qualityrelated activities in hph and those hospitals which have not joined the hph network nonhph in estonia in the beginning of  they conducted a postal survey among the top managers of fiftyfour estonian hospitals the questionnaire was based on the who standards for hph and on the set of the national quality assurance qa requirements for health services the study demonstrated some significant differences in the uptake of health promotion and qa activities between hph and nonhph for example regular patient satisfaction studies were conducted in  of hph and  of nonhph p and  of hph and  of nonhph cooperated with various patient organizations p systems for reporting and analysis of complications were implemented in  of hph and  of nonhph p also the implementation of various guidelines was more developed in hph all hph have carried out a risk analysis on the workplace and staff job satisfaction studies were conducted in  of hph and  nonhph p they concluded that the concepts of hph and qa are closely related making progress in health promotion is accompanied with qa and vice versa implementation of healthpromoting activities in hospitals promote the wellbeing and health of patients and hospital staff and creates a supportive environment to provide safe and highquality health services  to further develop hph effort needs to be made to ensure that hospital leaders and management are considered first if managerial staff have an appropriate understanding of the concept and principles of hph then it is more likely that health promotion activities can be introduced into the daily workings of hospitals and the necessary funds personnel and training on health promotion skills be provided  it does appear however that the hph movement is spreading rather than diminishing the focus of the hph projects is now enlarging addressing also organizational and community issues such as a change of organizational culture and environmental issues a future challenge of hph is still to link organizational health promoting activities with continuous quality improvement programmes making use of the apparent similarities such as the focus on continuous process and development involvement and ownership monitoring and measurement and to incorporate the principle of health promotion into the organizational structure and culture   case study meeting the comprehensive health goals the case of golnik hospital slovenia new health promotion and disease prevention services the initial idea of hph was focused on placing greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention rather than on diagnostic and curative services alone in public health disease prevention is usually defined as primary disease prevention which prevents diseases from occurring secondary prevention which detects disease at an early stage and prevents disease from developing and tertiary prevention which prevents aggravation or recurrence of disease and secures maintenance of functional level  traditionally hospitals primarily take care of tasks that relate to secondary or tertiary prevention whereas the primary sector and other social institutions take care of primary prevention it is however increasingly recognized that hospitals can play a significant role in linking all three levels of prevention in order to gain patients’ satisfactory outcome  the focus stays on effective treatment but in order to optimize health gain the outcome concept of hospitals has widened to include in addition to clinical outcomes also patient satisfaction healthrelated quality of life and health literacy all of these aspects have to get the attention within the treatment process there is international consensus that patients should be given recommendations guidance and support with regard to health promotion in hospitals  health promotion secures that risk conditions are identified and that the patient has knowledge of the significance of these conditions recommendations for changes and active support for carrying out these changes from this perspective follows that it makes sense to invest not only in clinical interventions but also in other interventions to improve health like educating patients for selfmanagement and developing situations to make the »healthy choice the easy choice« an important element is the activation of the patient’s individual resources and competences in coping with disease  a practical example for empowering patients for coproduction would be diagnosis and treatment related patient information training and counselling eg by informing patients about how they can contribute to the recuperation process by describing alternatives and side effects in order to enable patients to participate in the diagnostic process eg by providing all information needed participate in treatmentrelated decisionmaking actively participate in treatment and care processes eg by complying with the prescriptions thus health promotion and specific disease prevention form a continuum empowerment of patients for health promoting management of chronic disease expert interventions in hospitals provide in general only a turning point in disease process and a basis for recuperation or the successful management of chronic disease every contact with hospital based physicians either during hospitalization or ambulatory visit represents an ample opportunity to involve patients in diagnostic and therapeutic management of their medical condition personal experience of disease deterioration even to a slight degree generally makes patients susceptible to nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions in which their active role is indispensable the main part of recuperation or of the daytoday disease  management has to be performed primarily by the patients themselves with specific professional support by the hospital specialized services or other health care services this phase of the disease career lasts much longer and is out of direct control of the hospital but is crucial for the outcome of regaining health and quality of life hospitals have to take this perspective on the disease career into account by either providing necessary disease specific support by themselves or by referring patients to other specialized providers in the health care system the more complex and the more rare the disease and its treatment gets the more likely it remains a task of the hospital itself but this of course requires adequate legal and financial regulation which allows to provide these services systematically one example of effective intervention of this type of services is the case of golnik hospital where introducing specific type of treatment for specific group of patients has developed from hospital vision to national clinical pathway implementation specific immunotherapy concepts and principles introduction specific immunotherapy is a well established form of treatment of patients with some allergic diseases among main indications is allergic rhinitis the goal of specific immunotherapy is to diminish the allergic response to allergens the outcome of immunotherapy is a decrease in symptoms during allergen exposure better response to medical therapy and decreased risk of new allergen sensitizations in very few patients complete disappearance of the disease may be achieved as well selection of patients immunotherapy is only effective in carefully selected patients ige mediated allergy has to be proven appropriate patients are those in whom  allergic symptoms are due to only one allergen or a group of cross reactive allergens  for symptomatic relief high and regular doses of systemic and local drugs are necessary  duration of the allergen exposure season is long clinical studies have shown that patients with multiple allergies do not benefit from immunotherapy other diseases which might be the predominant cause of patients’ symptoms should be excluded like structural diseases of the nose and nonallergic rhinitis immunotherapy is effective only in patients where allergy is the onlypredominant mechanism of symptoms burden of immunotherapy for the health care system as immunotherapy is time consuming and requires excellent compliance by the patients in order to get an effect immunotherapy is not suitable for patients with mild and short lasting allergic diseases which are easily controlled with medications it is important also to consider the costs of allergen extracts for immunotherapy which are substantial and the same for patient with severe as for the patient with mild disease immunotherapy has also unpleasant and even dangerous side effects local reactions at the site of allergen application swelling itching are quite common fortunately systemic allergic reactions are extremely rare in pollen and dust mite  immunotherapy life threatening reactions are particularly common in patients with unstable asthma and patients with anaphylaxis medical and pharmaceutical approach to organization of immunotherapy immunotherapy should be offered only to those patients in whom high efficacy and low risk of side effects of the treatment is expected however the main interest of the producers and traders of allergen extracts is a widespread use of immunotherapy concerning safety more than efficacy of the treatment in order to reach their goal they run a promotion which is not always based on evidence derived from clinical studies sadly enough many practicing medical doctors are not updated with the results of evidence based medicine but get most medical information from pharmaceutical representatives and promotion leaflets  introduction of sublingual immunotherapy in slovenia in slovenia subcutaneous immunotherapy scit has been used for decades scit applications were mostly limited to the hospital based allergologists beside safety aspects the main reason for the limited use of immunotherapy was the way of reimbursement allergen extracts were not registered in slovenia and were only purchased by the health institution on their own expense doctors were not able to make a prescription for the allergen extract for the pharmacy for that reason private and community based allergologists were discouraged to prescribe immunotherapy and consequently didn’t get experience in selection and follow up of the patients on immunotherapy in  sublingual immunotherapy slit was registered in slovenia and reimbursed by health insurance that form of immunotherapy is suitable also for allergologists with only outpatient practice as patients don’t need to visit doctor for monthly injections and the cost of allergen is reimbursed we expected much higher interest in prescribing that form of immunotherapy clinical studies of slit showed comparable efficacy to scit when performed in carefully selected groups of monooligosensitized patients in all clinical trials slit was performed with a single allergen or a combination of two allergens in full dose of each allergen moreover studies showed marked dose response reducing the dose of allergen to one third the effect of slit was undistinguishable from placebo however producers of allergen extracts offered and promoted using  many allergens whose efficacy was not studied in clinical trials  nonstandardized allergen extracts in low dose  mixtures of unrelated allergens expected negative effects of introduction of sublingual immunotherapy on health allergologists in golnik hospital who are very experienced in immunotherapy using it for years not only in respiratory allergy but also in venom allergy recognized the threat for health care system due to inefficient use of health care resources namely we expected   prescriptions of slit to patients in whom there is only a weak indication  insufficient performance of slit namely only prescribing of allergen and not guiding the patient through the process of slit  predominant prescribing of mixtures of allergens and even allergens with no clinical relevance for that reason we prepared a program for education of allergologists willing to prescribe slit and set up a national clinical pathway for slit activities for setting up a national clinical pathway for sublingual immunotherapy activity  first step was to negotiate the conditions for reimbursement of allergen extract with health care insurance company it was decided that a patient gets a fully reimbursed slit extract after agreement of allergy counsel that predefined criteria for slit are fulfilled activity  next step was the selection of the criteria for immunotherapy we followed european guidelines for immunotherapy  we prepared a checklist where the allergologist marked the indication and the selection of the allergen for slit only allergens which were shown in randomized clinical trials to be effective were put on the list only one allergen could be selected for slit or in the case of two important noncross reactive allergens two separate slit were performed the check list in fact offered the allergologist to become familiar with the standard for appropriate selection of patient and allergen for immunotherapy appendix activity  next step was a development of a document which would guide the allergologist and the patient through the process of slit prescription of allergen extract must be made on time as the treatment has to begin  months before the pollen season patient should be instructed how to take the drug familiar with the local side effect of the therapy and adherent to therapy for that reason a check list for the patient was prepared where all important dates are put date for the beginning of the therapy dates of follow up visits and a table where the patient confirms the use of allergen drops and reports possible side effects in the beginning of the slit patients are offered a phone contact with the allergy nurse to clarify possible misunderstandings follow up visits are planned before the pollen season to provide the patient with the medications and at the top of the season to evaluate the efficacy of the slit all the documents were put in a form of a booklet which is owned by a patient but the copies of each filled page are put into the patient’s medical documentation file in the allergologist’s office the cover of the booklet was used for the detailed explanation of slit to the patient including the instruction for treatment of side effects  activity  activities were undertaken to obtain a consensus of the members of the slovenian association of allergy and clinical immunology on the content and the aim of the clinical pathway the same approach was used for adult and paediatric patients to facilitate the adherence of doctors with the clinical pathway it was decided that the data on the first year of the immunotherapy would be analyzed and presented as a slovenian study of introduction of the slit we obtained some sponsorship for the analysis form the producer of the allergen extracts in the first year  adult patients were recruited by  allergologists fortythree patients were treated at golnik hospital and  by other allergologists indications for slit were allergic rhinitis seasonal  perennial  and asthma  in  patients slit was started after scit discontinuation because of side effects majority of patients  were treated with a singled allergen  with a full dose of two allergens and only  with a mixture of allergens table  table  slovenian study of sublingual immunotherapy allergen monotherapy house dust mite  grasses  birch  hazel  ambrosia  sum                 combination with house dust mite grasses birch hazel ambrosia sum        patient was treated with a combination of grass birch and hazel pollen  conclusion slit was effectively introduced in accordance with evidence based medicine and european guidelines for immunotherapy  we believe that our approach reached the following goals  optimal clinical outcome of the treatment namely the minimal possible symptoms of the allergic rhinitis during the period of allergen exposure  optimal patientrelated outcome with the empowerment of the patients we probably achieved a positive perception of the treatment by the patients and improved their satisfaction in spite of long lasting therapy finally by well selected patients well performed slit and appropriate follow up during the pollen season patients had better quality of life in spite of the long lasting difficult therapy and bothersome chronic disease  optimal health care systemrelated outcome namely the best ratio between the cost and the outcome of the treatment the health care resources were directed toward the patients who were optimally selected and care was taken that resources were used optimally proposal for introduction of sublingual immunotherapy is presented in appendix  exercise task  from the

džakula theoretical background the world health organization who office for europe initiated the healthy cities project in  as a longterm international development project that seeks to put health on the agenda of the local city level political decisionmakers the idea of the healthy city was likable since everyone could imagine the city hesheit would like to live in and in the fifteen years time the group of the  first phase cities extended into  cities europe wide connected together through the who euro and the network of the european national healthy cities networks other regional who offices pacific region eastern mediterranean asia paho supported the hc project development so we entered  century with over  healthy cities worldwide  the healthy cities approach is grounded on system theories that perceived community as an ecosystem with capacity to work towards solutions to its own community identified problems the healthy city notion of community is focused on identifying community strengths instead of just diagnosing its’ problems and deficits theories of community based on the exact opposite of mrs thatcher’s now famous notion that “there is no society there are only individuals” suggest that communities form a whole which is greater than the sum of the individuals within them the concept of community relates to a geographical entity as well as to sub systems such as social groups or those joined by business or family ties but it includes simultaneously the idea of mutuality and shared norms and values  in order to secure project stability and continuity initiation of the healthy city requires explicit political commitment and consensus across party political lines leading throughout the years to the development of the sound project infrastructure hc office steering committee coordinating committee working groups alliances etc and creation of the clear city health and development strategy city health profile city health development plan healthy city is a process it is about the change innovation and formal system reorientation it is not award recognizing past merits it is a tool helping to address our cities present and future societal and developmental challenges and there were many of them for the post war and transitional croatian cities the healthy city project challenges city administrations to take seriously the process of developing health–enhancing public policies and create physical and social environments that support health but as well strengthen citizens’ participation with the vide variety of projects healthy cities networks aimed to bring improvements into the life of their citizens  children safe playgrounds additional medical care healthy kindergartens and youth free time activities elderly neighbourly help ‘elderly for elderly’ volunteer care help at home day centres hospice and palliative care services and disabled removing architectural barriers guide for disabled beach adapted for disabled lowering public telephones and adjusting transport young families successful parenting skills counselling and hot lines children and parents communication… and socially deprived groups  cities  administration commitment to that task is evident from their yearly official analysis city social profile city council working guidelines yearly business plans or changes in budget allocation for example the city of rijeka made the resolution not obligated by national legislation but as their own additional obligation to provide for “minimum  of the total city revenues for the social program” public opinion changed as well quotation – citizens’ views “people become aware that what we do today is good for their children… healthy city project helps us do the most we can given the circumstances we live in… work on the project results in the increased awareness pride that it is our city and that i am responsible for it…” quotation – citizens’ views “the main challenge of the healthy city project is to continue bringing efficiently together all parties interested in solving the identified problems and developing mutual trust and cooperation” it is necessary “to maintain the existing achievements and to further upgrade them providing vision for future in urban planning economic and human development of the city” mentioned examples could clarify how the healthy cities idea and tools could help to buffer the problems and negative health trends in communities it changes the way in which individuals communities private and voluntary organizations and local governments think about understand and make decisions about health croatian cities and public health professionals accepted “healthy city” idea form very beginning and used this new approach to empower communities during period of transition war aggression and various health challenges appeared after first steps of the “healthy city project” in   case study unemployment at the end of tiees unemployment especially among young and mid career workers was one of the hottest issues in the croatian cities it was addressed in three different but complementary ways  as the issue of sustainable economic development through the empowerment of unemployed and as the training vocational challenge city of labin the city of labin for example had fascinating results with socalled “entrepreneurial incubator” generating new jobs by providing shelter city subsidies working premises to potentially successful smallmiddle size businesses in the two years time supported enterprises had to demonstrate their ability to grow and generate new jobs locally in order to become eligible to get a city land on very privileged price to build own working halls and extend business city of zagreb in the city of zagreb majority of the unemployed  were those with no working experience while the second largest group  were those with year working experience who unexpectedly lose their jobs due to their firm bankruptcy the strategy to address this problem developed by the healthy city project team in zagreb went in two directions one set of interventions was run by the zagreb employment agency and included provision of the new education  opportunities additional training and retraining free of charge for the end users unemployed the other set of interventions as well financially supported by the city was run by the zagreb association of the unemployed that provided a series of workshops for their members on ‘how to succeed in finding job’ through the workshops most of the participants improved selfconfidence identified own potentials developed personal jobfinding plan and learned how to present themselves to potential employers over half of them  succeeded in the few months time – to find a job or get retrained city of split the split healthy city project tried to address the lack of entrepreneurial skills in general population in our culture people expect that job will be given to them very few have a courage and skills to start own business author remark by putting emphasis on primary school children training with the project named petra they introduced the project management techniques in the school curricula enabling young children to design and run own projects ie develop management skills early in life environment protection and quality improvement the protection and improvement of the environment quality was another area of the greatest importance for croatian cities between  and  the city of rijeka made major improvements introduced natural gas into the households protected drinking water zvir i and ii improved sewerage collection and disposition collector at delta waste management… due to the traffic congestion caused by constantly increasing number of motor vehicles in the city of zagreb main environmental challenges were connected with the air quality zagreb healthy city project brought together a large group of partner agencies to address jointly this problem several city departments the city planning and environmental health office city office for urban design building housing utility and traffic and the city health and social welfare office and city owned companies  zet trams buses and other public transport zagreb parking maintenance and building of parking areas and underground garages zrinjevac maintenance of public green areas cistoca waste disposal and recycling cleaning and washing the streets worked on development and implementation of the strategy which aimed to solve traffic congestions through road construction enhance nonmotor traffic conditions curb lowering and bicycle lane building foster public transport and use of environmentallyfriendly fuel bio diesel increase safety and decrease noise and air pollution “democracy schools – youth council” one of the croatian healthy cities shiniest examples of democratic and participatory practices development is the “democracy schools – youth council” project democracy school program is inschool  to  grade of primary and  to  grades of secondary schools training that improves students’ knowledge of democratic practices and develop theirs social and debate skills school program enables teenager’s to articulate their expectations from local community and youth councils established as the city council advisory bodies allows their direct participation in  decisionmaking processes of local authorities identifying needs and allocation resources for youth programs project is highly valued and spread all over croatia during the last six years  croatian cities established either city’s children or youth councils excerise task  find healthy city experiences about successful health promotion programs

risteskakuc sašo stoleski dragan mijakoski theoretical background introduction health and safety at work as a basic human right and constitutes a social and health dimension of the principle of sustainable development the occupational health and the wellbeing of the working people is a key element for the total socioeconomic development of every country more than the half of the word population belongs to the global working force which is continuously during its working age more or less submitted to a large number of factors hazardous to health that originated from the working place old and new risks at workplaces beside the traditional problems and risks at work such as noise vibration physical workload biological and chemical agents infective agents bad working conditions to which  to of the working population is still exposed the new changes of the working processes and the new technology are carrying new risks and challenges of the professional pathology of the working place even to those that are looking quite safe and harmless those are new chemical substances and materials some of them with unknown and unidentified hazardous effects new biotechnological and carcinogenic materials allergenic substances highly frequented nonionizing radiation ionizing radiation psychosocial stress unsuitable ergonomic design etc figure  there are additional effects like social and economic conditions fluctuation of the work force working place mobility psychophysical abuse and violence at the work place there are the changes in the organization of the work and shiftwork fragmentation of enterprises and increased number of the smallsize enterprises and selfemployed dynamic and growing demand on the work as a result of the market globalization significantly changes the economic structures and the working conditions at almost every single workplace  accordingly there are no safety or risk free workplaces in the industry economic or non economic enterprises service activities public or private large medium or small enterprises especially in the developing countries with still present outofdate technology and use of old equipment without respect of the existing legislative for protection at work and the health surveillance of the workers seized without a register of occupational hazards and workplaces with occupational risk all of this bring up to work injuries occupational diseases and workrelated diseases such as musculoskeletal psychological cardiovascular respiratory neurological cancers etc that are cause for a long term absence from work lowered or terminally lost working ability invalidity or death  blood pressure tobacco alcohol cholesterol overweight low fruit and vegetable intake physical inactivity environmental risks occupational risks illicit drugs            dalys  source world health report  figure  occupational risks among other threats in whoeuro despite the traditional occupational illnesses such as pneumoconiosis which are connected to “hard” working places the risk of ruined health is present even at work places considered safely like a work with a computer some segments of the working population are with a specific vulnerability when exposed to certain professional risks female working force young and old workers farmers workers in an informal sector middle and small enterprises selfemployed etc especially serious is the problem with child labour people with special needs unemployed respiratory diseases that are occurring due to inhalation of microscopic particles organic or nonorganic sio asbestos coal dust pesticides etc are present in many professions construction engineering mining metallurgy agriculture textile industry tobacco industry wood industry and pastry product industry because of the long latent period of some of this diseases carcinoma asbestosis silicosis they are still present in the countries with a high level of control and protection at the work place from the total number of the patients with asthma  are due to professional causes  of the pulmonary obstructive diseases or  deaths per year with a the pulmonary obstructive diseases are with a occupational aetiology  different chemical biological and physical agents in professional surroundings are classified as carcinogenic materials round  male and  female age  years from the active working population can be exposed to those carcinogenic agents on global level  of the pulmonary and tracheal cancers are due to exposure to asbestos cadmium arsenics chromium nickel or silica and  leukaemia’s are due to occupational exposure it is assessed that  out of the total morbidities of cancers are due to the occupational etiological factor  musculoskeletal diseases are multi factorial and are connected with the ergonomic factors at workplace heavy physical workload repeated bending and sudden moves as well as repeated monotonous movements unphysiological continuous posture of the body vibrations etc organizational and social characteristics of the work especially high is the prevalence to those diseases in construction workers farmers and health workers half of the active working population of usa is complaining about those diseases the who  world report on health is pointing out the fact that  of the cases with the low beck pain are due to hazardous occupational ergonomic exposure  globally the noise is also one of the most frequent risks at the workplace and is cause for  of the definite and irreversible hearing loss the damage to the hearing can additionally become a risk for a numerous accidents and injuries at work as well different consequences from that occupational health indicators the health indicators in the domain of health and safety at work according to who are the rate for incidence and prevalence of the occupational diseases and work related diseases rate of fatal accidents and injuries at work morbidity rate at the active working population disability incidence in  population the influence of the work on the health is difficult to observe the countries work in different health and insurance systems the declared rates of the occupational diseases are based on the existing national legislative effectiveness in detecting enlisting and registration of the occupational diseases as well as the compensatory mechanisms and systems for compensation the extrapolation done according to the incidence of the occupational diseases in the european countries are good informational system going from  to  gives annual incidence of  cases of occupational diseases the risk factors that can cause injuries at work are numerous and at different work places according to the ilo annually in the world happens    injuries at work out of which   are fatal injuries at work that means that the average risk from injuries at work is  on  workers with a fatal outcome of   the average european risk is  for injuries and  for fatal injuries  this numbers can and must be prevented in the interest of the health and well being as well as from the point of interest for the economy and the productivity of the labour occupational health and burden of diseases aiming to measure the health condition of the population from the aspect of paying off as well as to assess which intervention that will improve the health needs special attention a concept of daly disability adjusted life years was introduced that is a measurement which is measuring the burden from the disease and is presented through total loss due to a damage health from any reason whether it is a premature death or invalidity  limitation in the functioning that can be both physical and mental in different period of time because of that the use of daly enables to establish priority for health services to establish groups with special risk and providing  comparable measurements for intervention as well as for program and sector planning according to who global plan of action on workers’ health occupational risks are among ten threats in who euro  daly’s the results published in the global burden of disease  are pointing that  of daly worldwide  millions daly are result of occupational diseases compeering to  daly as a result of malnutrition as a leading reason and  daly as a reason listed last  the prevention of occupational diseases and injuries is legal and moral obligation although it involves great expenses according to the european agency for safety and health at work the cost for occupational diseases and injuries is between  –  gdp depending on country different costs are estimated and prescribed cost for sick leave and invalidity netherlands    billion euros medical costs netherlands billion euros production loss due to work disability germany  –  billion euros lost for the sickinjured and their families great britain  billion euros the total cost for occupational diseases and injuries in italy in  was  billion euros  economic losses from poor working conditions occupational accidents and occupational diseases in south east europe are more than  billion usd annually about  of the gdp  the cost connected to the occupational diseases and injuries at work can be divided in tree groups − direct primary and secondary − indirect − immeasurable the direct primary cost is cost for medical care and health protection that are paid from the health insurance fund for treatment rehabilitation and therapy of the occupational diseases and injuries at work while the direct secondary cost is covering all the costs that the individual is paying for treatment of hishers condition which is a result of a certain occupational diseases and injuries at work the indirect cost includes absenteeism time period necessary to regenerated the process of production in which the patient suffering from certain occupational diseases and injuries at work was included training for the substitute insurance that has to be paid by the enterprise etc the immeasurable cost pain suffering of the individuals and their surrounding is increasing the price of the occupational diseases and injuries at work that in most cases could be prevented the poor health care and protection at the work place leads to reduction of the working ability that can cause a loss of of the gdp according to the estimations of the world bank  of the daly could be prevented with programs for health and safety at work  occupational health and key elements health at work and healthy work environments are among the most valuable assets of individuals communities and countries “occupational health is an important strategy not only to ensure the health of workers but also to contribute positively to the national economies through improved productivity quality of products work  motivation job satisfaction and contribute also to the overall quality of life of working people and society”  the term “occupational health” on traditional manner includes the maintenance and promotion and workers health and working capacity but also the improvement of the working environment and safe and healthy workplaces nowadays new broader approach is promoted recognizing the fact that occupational health is a key but not a unique element of workers’ health workers health is a public health approach to resolving the health problems of working populations including all determinants of health recognized as targets of risk management it focuses on primary prevention of occupational and workrelated diseases and injuries protection and promotion of the health of workers occupational health constitutes the core of this approach followed by the other public health activities such as prevention and control of communicable and chronic diseases health promotion organization and financing of health services and environmental health the workers health approach requires close collaboration of all stakeholders and coordination of all interventions related to the health of workers  figure  the public health approach the labour approach workers health occupational health all workers beyond the workplace responsibility of everybody all health determinants other stakeholders insurance labour contract employers responsibility only at the workplace only workrelated health issues negotiation between workers and employers health and environment authorities health protection not subject to collective negotiation figure  from occupational health to workers health “in the past two decades the settings in occupational health have become more complex multifactorial multimechanism and multioutcome” the health of the workers depends on a combination of factors and a complex interaction between them • working environment mechanical physical chemical biological ergonomic psychosocial factors social determinants related to work employment status occupational position social inequalities and poverty • workrelated health behaviour individual preventive health practices and personal healthrelated behaviour in general • access to health services adequate and affordable occupational health services for primary prevention cure and rehabilitation  occupational health system and occupational health services all these facts confirm the need for infrastructure continuity and security evidence and quality comprehensive multidisciplinary content coverage costeffectiveness multisectorial collaboration in occupational health oh system  the development of oh system includes the critical prerequisites like political commitment legal basis leading institutions training and education methods and guidelines standards collaboration of employers and employees financing and infrastructure  the major component of occupational safety and health system or infrastructure is occupational health service unfortunately today a lot of workers of the world have never even heard of such services even in many industrialized countries the coverage of occupational health services is below  and in most countries of the world the rate is below  the main goal is that all workers have access to ohs  comprehensive and longterm response from international organizations who ilo ec and joint efforts are recognized and needed in order to develop occupational health system including occupational health services as a key tool occupational health services provide also an important instrument for practical implementation of the conventions and recommendations of international organizations who and ilo as well as implementation of the principles of european directives on occupational safety and health the government and policymakers should make more effective use of occupational health approach and practices to support overall socioeconomic development development of modern work life and social and economic dimensions in the national development program there is a need to define concise national policy and program for development of occupational health services as a system providing expert support for enterprises and working people  ilo convention no and its accompanying recommendation no  are used in many countries as models for establishing requirements for the organization and functioning of occupational health services   eu document improving quality and productivity at work community strategy  on health and safety at work emphasized the need for services to all working people of the world the implementation of article  of framework directive eec reveals considerable disparities with regard to the quality coverage and accessibility of prevention services one of the key objectives in the community strategy is the development of occupational health services especially for underserved vulnerable and high risks sectors and workers  th world health assembly wha  endorsed the global plan of action on workers’ health gpa  and urged the member states to take a number of measures on workers health  this plan of action is based on several principles in the different priority areas these principles are intended to guide the formulation implementation and evaluation of programs and activities in the area of workers health they consist of right to health and to favourable working conditions priority of primary prevention workplace as a setting for health interventions coordinated response by the health system equity in workers health   basic occupational health services bohs one of the objectives of who gpa is to “improve the performance and the access to occupation health services” and pointing out that all workers should have access to the occupational health services in order to achieve this goal the basic occupational health services bohs approach is recommended as a joint response to the priority area set for the who ilo and icoh collaboration the concept of bohs is based on the principles of primary health care equity universality with the objective the who global plan of action ilo convention no and recommendation   the basic occupational health services are an essential service for protection of peoples health at work for promotion of health wellbeing and work ability as well as for prevention of illhealth and accident  bohs should provide the services accessible and available to all workers addressing to local needs and adapted to local conditions and existing resources effective and costeffective in service provision the objective of basic occupational health is to provide oh services for all workpeople in the world in both industrialized and developing countries regardless of the sector of economy size of company geographic area or nature of employment contract the provision of bohs should be an integrated part of the social policy of work life and should be guaranteed by public authority the ohs infrastructure is called ohs system and it depends on the overall national health system for health services and occupational health and safety however the bohs infrastructure should be the part of integrated infrastructure for health and safety can be carried out by several types of services units collaborate with and take support from primary health care collaborate with safety services and specially should serve underserved high risks smes  occupational health services support the employer in improving work conditions but employer has the primary responsibility for health and safety at work on one side the appointment of occupational health services does not discharge the employer from his responsibility for work conditions and on other side occupational health services assist the employer in fulfilling his obligations for health and safety at work  without prejudicing the responsibility primary responsibilities of the employers and of tripartite collaboration social partners and the government the provision of services to sectors which do lack tripartite mechanism are the responsibility of the government and other public sector in general governments should ensure equity and access to occupational health services and their quality regardless of the mode of service provision all levels of the health system play a role in the provision of services from basic functions at the primary health care level to the more sophisticated functions at the regional and national level the full coverage of the total working population in the countries should be set as a long  term objective in the first stage priority should be given to the highrisk sectors and the seriously underserved groups which are most in need while specialized comprehensive occupational health services are the best way to support the well established industrial and services sectors for the underserved sectors and high risk and vulnerable workers it was found appropriate to combine such development with the overall development of primary health care services  system in organization of such service the possibilities to utilize the whoiloicoh basic occupational health services approach was found appropriate  activities of occupational health services the activities of occupational health services are based on prevention and promotion focused on workers’ health and work environment bohs have a strong focus on primary prevention the concept is comprehensive and includes prevention cure and rehabilitation activities are complemented by the workplace health promotion bohs activities start with process of orientation and planning and proceed to the identification of needs risk assessment proposal and management of preventive and control actions to employers and workers and evaluation of activities on the basis of data on workers’ health and work environment with further steps in the process of development  • planning orientation and identification of health and safety needs • surveillance of the work environment • surveillance of workers’ health • risk assessment  • information and education on risks and advice on need for preventive and control actions • preventive actions for the management and control of health and safety hazards and risks • prevention of accidents • maintaining firstaid and participation in emergency preparedness • diagnosis of occupational and workrelated diseases • curative and rehabilitation services • workplace health promotion healthy lifestyle general preventive and public health measures • collection of data and record keeping • evaluation of oh activities and their effects and impacts • replanning and necessary actions for the development of services service provision models different models for the provision of occupational health services are available • big industry inplant model is the most widespread ohs for special sector or trade group services and private consultancies organized jointly by smse • public health care establishments like community and other local primary health services health centres outpatient departments group medical practices  the provision of basic occupational health services bohs should be a priority in countries and economic sectors with high occupational risk and very low coverage of workers by occupational health services the proposed model of bohs as a part of integrated infrastructure of oh system should enable provision of ohs on all levels from basic function at primary health care level to the more  sophisticated functions international standard services and comprehensive ohs at local and national level  the provisions of the bohs for every worker must be supported by the public sector and mechanisms for delivering and financing should be put in place to protect workers health and safety and to ensure the sustainable development  human resources in the optimal case the occupational health services will be provided by a multidisciplinary team physicianspecialist in occupational health nurse occupational hygienist and psychologist in some countries where not enough specialists are available primary health care team may provide services with additional training in occupational health at the secondary level different support services diagnostic analytical etcare needed national centres of excellence institutes of occupational health should provide the evidence base for preventive interventions technical support to ohs specialized laboratory tests and services and training of oh practitioners and to plan and monitor implementation of ohs workers should be actively involved in the evaluation and control of the hazards the risk management tools should be the basis of the intervention on the workplace settings  occupational health services can also seek support from inspection agencies labour and public health inspectorates state policy should support education and training of experts for occupational health services through the specialization in the areas of occupational health participation in field research and establishment of professional associations of occupational health services financing of ohs according to ilo convention no on ohs the employer has the main financial responsibility for providing occupational health services so the financing reflects employer’s responsibility for working conditions and it is presented by the different options direct financing indirect financing or public funding the direct funding is focused on big industry model group services or consultancies indirect financing includes the various insurance schemes special funds or shares in some countries occupational health is covered by public funding through the central government or local authorities instead of conclusions the development of occupational health system and policy requires implementing one stepby step approach as a start point is necessary to strengthen governmental stewardship and ensure continuous political commitment to occupational health oh policy should provide the development of legislation and standards in the field as well as effective mechanisms for financing of occupational health services the expected results should be ensuring access to basic occupational health services for all workers  with establishing essential requirements for service provision and providing the quality assurance systems for occupational health services for realization of the planed steps should stimulate national and international efforts for capacity building and establishing critical core capacities of countries to deal with workers health the key message should be the integration of the development of occupational health services into national strategies health systems performance improvement plans and health sector reforms in particular with regards to primary health care and public health exercise after introductory lecture students work in small groups and are asked to discuss on recommended subjects • the

psychotherapy psychotherapy as a profession fields of activity of psychotherapists psychotherapists’ organisations training and economic aspects  as well as significance of psychotherapy for public health definitions and explanation of basic terms psychotherapy according to european association for psychotherapy appendix  to the board minutes siracuse th to th of october  the profession of psychotherapy is defined as  • the practice of psychotherapy is the comprehensive conscious and planned treatment of psychosocial psychosomatic and behavioural disturbances or states of suffering with scientific psychotherapeutic methods through an interaction between one or more persons being treated and one or more psychotherapists with the aim of relieving disturbing attitudes to change and to promote the maturation development and health of the treated person it requires both a general and a specific trainingeducation • the independent practice of psychotherapy consists of autonomous responsible enactment of the capacities described in paragraph  independent of whether the activity is in a free practice or institutional work psychotherapy approaches the main psychotherapy approaches and schools are psychoanalyticpsychodynamic cognitive behavioural systemic family existentialhumanistic personcentred and related experiential approaches postmodern and integrative approaches all these approaches can have different modalities individual marital family and group therapies  there is an ongoing discussion about whether methods should be applied in a »pure« way of whether »integrative« models are not perhaps better nevertheless many common basic elements can be perceived which today contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of psychotherapy over and above the specifics of a particular approach or school  historical development and expansion of psychotherapy the foundation of modern psychotherapy was systematically developed at the end of th century and in the first decades of th century with the work of sigmund freud  – psychoanalysis was for many decades the only psychotherapeutic approach but after the second world war many new approaches were developed for example cognitive behavioural humanistic systemic family approaches and many others over the last twenty years the term psychotherapy has become an international “supraterm” for different psychotherapeutic approaches to describe a curative influence of the relationship between psychotherapist and patientclient on neurotic psychotic psychosomatic and somatopsychic disorders psychotherapy became globalised since it expanded all over the world it can be estimated that there are about  psychotherapists worldwide most of them about  in europe and about  in north america  characteristics of psychotherapeutic profession psychotherapy as a profession psychotherapy as an autonomous profession is practised during last  years in  the first law on psychotherapy was passed in sweden and other european countries followed for example italy austria germany netherlands and others these laws have the effect of promoting the development of psychotherapy as a profession there are professional regulations in other countries such as usa argentina and chile which however are subsumed under the vocational group of psychologists psychiatrists and clinical social workers and in which psychotherapy as a profession in its own right does not always appear within the framework of these professions there have been reimbursements of psychotherapy services from insurance schemes for many years in the usa and canada  fields of activity of psychotherapists psychotherapy is practised by most therapists in private practice or in institutions such as psychiatric wardsclinics or counselling offices mostly on two large areas • treating mental disorders and • encouraging personal growth by clients who have no psychiatric diagnosis so psychotherapy is effective as primary secondary and tertiary prevention what will be discussed later on patients are treated usually in sessions lasting one hour either individually in groups or in a family context the most important form used is the psychotherapeutic interview sometimes in connection with exercises designed to stimulate new experiences with healing effects  psychotherapists have also developed effective practice on the interfaces with social work schools and management and increasingly psychotherapists are being called upon to take care of acute trauma patients in the wake of catastrophes refugees etc psychotherapists’ organisations until far into the th century only specialists and those within the inner circle were aware of the existence of different forms of psychotherapy not until the founding of umbrella organisations was it possible to extend the scientific and developmental dialogue and thereafter to be perceived in a serious fashion by the public at large in the meantime umbrella organisations have been set up on all continents with the aim of developing psychotherapy in their countries and on their continent in general   the most representative umbrella organisation in europe is european association for psychotherapy eap  the eap represents  organisations  national umbrella associations  europeanwide associations for psychotherapy from  european countries and by that more than  psychotherapists membership is also open for individual psychotherapists based on the strasbourg declaration on psychotherapy of   the eap represents high training standards for a scientifically based psychotherapy and stands for a free and independent practice of psychotherapy the declaration has following five points  psychotherapy is an independent scientific discipline the practice of which amounts to an independent and free profession  training in psychotherapy takes place at an advanced qualified and scientific level  the multiplicity of the methods of psychotherapy is assured and guaranteed  a full psychotherapeutic training covers theory selfexperience and practice under supervision adequate knowledge of various psychotherapeutic processes is acquired  access to training is through various preliminary qualifications in particular in human and in social sciences one of the most important endeavours of eap at the moment is to create a common platform of psychotherapy regulations in the eu with the eventual goal of central legislature and licensing procedures benefits of such platform would be • euwide recognition of psychotherapy as a profession • freedom of movement for psychotherapists • uniform training standards and licensing procedures • overall increase in quality of psychotherapeutic standards training the necessary training to become a psychotherapist which lasts several years has three main pillars • self experience • theory and • practical work under supervision the eap requires for its “european certificate of psychotherapy” a minimum of  hours training both in introductory so called propaedeutics and an approach specific training most training takes place in private institutions as a postgraduate training or as a “second profession” education during last years there is a growing interest of the universities for psychotherapy programmes for example in october  private university sigmund freud in vienna opened the three level bachelor master and doctoral psychotherapy study where different approaches are integrated under the same roof economic aspects psychotherapy has also become a market the fees range from gifts to hourly fees of  euro and more depending on the economy of the country in which psychotherapist  practises in countries with a higher degree of regulation of psychotherapy public institutions and social securities are providing more and more public money for psychotherapeutic treatment in many countries in which psychotherapy has not reached this status yet only the richer patients have access to it  significance of psychotherapy for public health as mentioned above psychotherapy is effective on several levels of disease prevention being from primary to tertiary  primary prevention the role of psychotherapy in primary prevention is keeping mental disorders from ever occurring already freud’s way of doing psychoanalysis had this dimension because he has shown that every person who is interested to improve the quality of her or his life can profit from psychoanalysis before some recognizable mental disorder appears freud’s message is still modern “live more conscious life be more aware of the complexity of mental functioning and realize your potential in work and love” during the last  years this message was spread to millions of people in different psychotherapy approaches especially in working with groups for example in sensitivity training  or encounter groups  especially in dealing with endangered and vulnerable population groups eg adolescents pregnant women unemployed people disabled old people etc many psychotherapists developed programmes that are combined with psychoeducative approach • for children and families  • for mothers with infants to support them after childbirth with counselling and practical help  • for groups where members learn how to cope with stress or be more assertive in everyday life situations • for childabuse awareness and preventive programmes • preventing violence • somatic disease prevention since chronic somatic illness increases likelihood for ill mental health • drug and alcohol free parenting programmes in endangered groups etc  secondary prevention the role of psychotherapy in secondary prevention is in early detection of mental disorders and early intervention to reduce the risk of chronicity disability and suicide especially important is this kind of prevention in the field of depression and alcohol disorders psychotherapists are well educated for recognising signs and symptoms of depression and alcohol problems early recognition is of course to be followed by evidence based treatment being mostly parallel  psychopharmacological psychotherapeutic and educational psychotherapists contribute also to health risk assessment self examinations and self help are routine techniques to be transferred and encouraged with patients with mental disorders especially when reoccurring the educational courses group and individual counselling on recognising warning signs of disorder and coping strategies are valuable therapeutic tool in the hands of the patient and his or her relatives already during ’s many  psychotherapists found ways to spread psychotherapeutic methods in selfhelp groups   tertiary prevention the role of psychotherapy in tertiary prevention is in the treatment and care for people with clinically expressed mental disorders in acute primary or early phase and chronically late or rehabilitation phase since the prevalence of mental disorders in europe is increasing  and because psychotherapy is especially effective in treating the most common mental disorders anxiety depression and substance abuse disorders  the significance of including psychotherapy as integral part of comprehensive health care is also becoming more and more important during last  years psychotherapists have proven the effectiveness of psychotherapy in treating all kinds of mental disorders in general and that different approaches have relative similar efficacy  case study psychotherapy in austria and slovenia introduction in the following section the comparison will be made between developed austrian psychotherapy services which are integrated in the health system and undeveloped psychotherapy services in slovenia the comparison makes clear that psychotherapy must overcome different challenges and develop through different phases to become an integral part of comprehensive health care austria psychotherapeutic service as integral part of comprehensive health care historical perspective pritz outlined the brief history of psychotherapy in austria  vienna is the cradle where at the end of  th century freud laid foundations of scientific psychotherapy freud called his method “psychoanalysis” it became popular all over the world and even today it is still often used as synonym for psychotherapy several other psychotherapy methods were developed in austria as a result of contacts with freud for example individual psychology developed by alfred adler  and logotherapy developed by viktor frankl  the era of national socialism  put an abrupt end to the sensational development of psychotherapy in austria but after  signs of new life in psychoanalysis began to stir towards a new concept in the ’s there was a boom in new psychotherapy approaches for example personcentred psychotherapy according to carl rogers psychodrama gestalt therapy autogenic training hypnosis systemic family therapy etc an enthusiastic phase of development ensued reinforced when departments bearing the word “psychotherapy” in their title were set up at the medical faculties of the universities of vienna graz and innsbruck since  there have been regular  introductory lectures and seminars at the departments of psychology and pedagogy at the above mentioned universities an important step was taken in  with the foundation of the umbrella organization of austrian psychotherapeutic associations this organization first united  associations who set their sights on promoting psychotherapy in austria the legal situation at that time was such that only medical doctors were permitted to practise psychotherapy as a curative treatment however nearly   of those carrying out psychotherapy did not come from medical background but from other psychosocial professions in particular psychologists social workers and teachers this led to a public discussion about quality control in psychotherapy in combination with the will of the umbrella organization to push through legal regulations for psychotherapy as a profession in its own right the beginning of selfstanding track after intensive and controversial discussions both among public at large and the psychotherapy associations the law on psychotherapy was finally passed of in july  this law which requires a year training and enables psychotherapy practised as a profession in its own right had farreaching consequences for the development of psychotherapy in austria in  the general social security law was changed to include the provision that every austrian citizen who is in need of psychotherapeutic treatment for an illness must be provided with such treatment as a part of public health service since then work is ongoing to ensure that this law is actually put into practice and today in all  federal provinces insurance companies have made possible to obtain psychotherapy within public health service which was before normal for other forms of medical treatment today around  trained psychotherapists in austria are active in the health care service and the social services so one of the consequences of the new law was an exponential growth of the expenditure by health and social insurance for psychotherapy source hauptverband der österreichischen sozialversicherungträger th may  cited by pritz  table  the whole psychotherapy market private and public together in  in austria had a volume of approximately  millions euros per year table  exponential growth of the expenditure by health and social insurance for psychotherapy in period  in austria year          millions euros           also the psychotherapy training is regulated by a law all education and training institutes and facilities require an accreditation from the health ministry for which a psychotherapy board is responsible this board made up of representatives of all psychotherapy approaches university professors and other representatives of psychotherapy consists almost entirely of psychotherapists and its members number approximately  persons it is the boards task to examine the applications for training accreditation which is granted only after a rigorous examination of scientific qualifications and abilities of the trainers current position in relation to health care system today psychotherapy is integrated in the health care system in whole of austria all public health insurance associations have a system of supplementing payment for treatment in certain cases they underwrite the whole amount treatment is carried out in private practises and also in public institutions belonging to the health insurance associations and in counselling offices which are subsidised from public funds of which there are approximately  in the whole austria psychotherapy is expanding within hospitals too international significance it is not a surprise that recently austria as one of the most developed countries in psychotherapy field in the world gave another thee very important contributions for the development of globalised psychotherapy the foundation of the world council for psychotherapy the foundation of faculty study of psychotherapy and the foundation of european psychotherapy universities network with the foundation of the world council for psychotherapy in  in zurich switzerland psychotherapy attained a new quality of communication which had never existed previously  international professional congresses had been held for many years but a synoptic view was missing and the importance of overcoming prejudices towards other modalities and developments in the profession had not received enough attention the unified view creates new insights and new hierarchies of importance at the same time the situation is stimulating for all questions relating to psychotherapy at the world congresses which have been held so far in   and  in vienna and  in buenos aires approximately  delegates from more than  countries took part each time and contributed to the dialogue training the integration of psychotherapy to the academic world of universities is crucial for its affirmation as the autonomous scientifically based discipline and as the autonomous profession in october  sigmund freud university sfu  from vienna started with the faculty study of psychotherapy the enrolment is possible immediately after the secondary school which is organized in accordance with bologna process three levels  bachelor master doctor this is the first project of faculty study in psychotherapy in the world which enables students to choose psychotherapy as the first profession providing a bachelor’s and master’s degree in psychotherapy science and that also integrates different psychotherapy approaches under the same roof while psychotherapy training was offered exclusively at postgraduate level by psychotherapy training institutions in the past sfu blends academic training for psychotherapists with comprehensive research activities  previously carried out at various research institutes separately the university cooperates with a number of psychotherapy training institutions in various areas the project has also symbolic meaning because it takes place in freud’s town and under his name opens new chapter in the development of psychotherapy in  austrian psychotherapists gave initiative for establishing the european psychotherapy universities network epu  epu has the following mission statement • has a pluralistic perspective on emotional topics psychotherapeutic approaches and practice • cooperates in psychotherapy research psychotherapy education and treatment activities • promotes psychotherapy as an academic discipline and profession in its own rights • promotes public founding of psychotherapy • provides scientifically based information on psychotherapy to the public slovenia psychotherapy in a country in transition slovenia in transition in the communist period  slovenian state welfare system had advantages in securing easy access to child care education employment entertainment health housing maternity leave and pensions on a universal basis yet the standard of services was unsatisfactory in many instances choice was very limited and inequality was introduced by the privileges given to members of a large number of elites formally the yugoslav federation had moved to a policy of “selfmanagement” in industry and policy areas such as housing in the ’s in reality this meant that employees had a lot to say in how services were run but policies and budgets were imposed from above nongovernmental organizations were frowned upon despite the fact that in the precommunist period there were many such small scale organisations in operation selfmanagement was not introduced even formally to traditional welfare services at that period in line with other communist countries the prevalent mode of handling longterm health and psychological problems was institutionalization institutions existed for people with learning difficulties physical disability and mental illness side by side with orphanages while the physical state of these institutions was reasonable if poor the social segregation was almost total  although better off economically than other east european and exsoviet union states slovenia has experienced an increase in unemployment and a parallel decrease in growth of real wage and gross domestic product gdp in the beginning of the nineties in spite of the revival of economic growth after  the inequalities of income nevertheless increased and the unemployment remained relatively high at the end of the s slovenia had ad per capita annual gdp of approximately  and the unemployment rate of approximately  under the circumstances of economic restructuring the system of social security has functioned relatively efficiently the share of funds devoted to various cash benefits for the population increased from a total of  of the gdp in  to  of the gdp in  in  gdp was  billion us a cause of greater concern are the data which are  showing a considerable growth in the number of individuals and families whose assets had been so reduced after the  that they were not sufficient for subsistence at the end of s the investment of money in health care is approximately  of the gdp and in social welfare system approximately  of the gdp  after the democratic shift private practice in the health and social care system became allowed since then the number of private practises has been increasing posing numerous questions on how to structure and regulate relations between the public and the private sectors at the end of the s slovenia has been confronted with many difficult challenges on the macro level • the number of recipients of various cash benefits and other social transfers is rising • the share of elderly inhabitants is rapidly increasing • there is a growing number of children and young people suffering from violence and sexual harassment • due to economic uncertainty shortterm conditions for creating a young family are not improving • the proportion of people with various addiction problems is on the increase etc the development of psychotherapy in slovenia when psychoanalysis spread greatly after world war one its influence also reached slovenia especially the generation of young artists born around  showed great interest in the new science however after  interest in psychoanalysis was diminished and no psychoanalytic circle was formed  in the “hard years” of communist period psychoanalytic works were discouraged for example the only book related to freud’s work that was translated into slovenian language in the seventies was emil ludwig’s der entzauberte freud which was extremely critical during the ’s and ’s the conditions for development of psychotherapy slowly improved especially in the line of psychiatric services all over former yugoslavia which slovenia was part until  dispensaries of mental health became part of the outpatient medical service professional collaboration among psychiatrists and psychologists in these dispensaries slowly became an everyday need at first the task of psychologists was to develop psychodiagnostic measures but they grew increasingly more involved in the clinical therapeutic work as well among psychiatrists and psychologists a growing need for additional education emerged though possibilities for postgraduate education in slovenia improved a systematic psychotherapeutic training was available only abroad in slovenia psychotherapy as an organized professional movement began at the end of the s when the endeavours of some psychiatrists and clinical psychologists fruitfully joined the year  was a turning point in the development of psychotherapy in slovenia when first systematic training of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists interested in psychotherapy started thus the first slovenian psychotherapy training was designed as a subspecialization for psychiatrists and clinical psychologists since it took place within the health service it was organized as a psychotherapy section of the slovenian medical society renowned croatian and serbian psychoanalysts participated as guests the oneyear psychotherapy course  propaedeutics comprising theory selfexperience and practice under supervision soon became an integral part of specialization for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists at the end of the s on the grounds of cooperation with professionals from austria otto wilfert raoul schindler sensitivity trainings were introduced to slovenia which led to an increase of interest in group dynamics on the part of various professionals eg in education psychiatric and caretaking institutions some slovenian psychologists fruitfully combined knowledge of group dynamics and psychotherapy with counselling in the context of social work they also found possibilities to combine psychotherapy and voluntary work in the area of psychosocial help to children and adolescents with psychosocial problems  in the ’s first psychotherapy publications appeared and new inpatient psychotherapeutic facilities developed in ljubljana the capital of slovenia such as a psychotherapeutic centre a psychotherapeutic ward in the psychiatric hospital a centre for the treatment of alcoholism etc the contacts of slovenian psychotherapists with psychotherapy associations in the former yugoslavia the association of yugoslav psychotherapists was also established in  and abroad expanded the psychotherapeutic training psychodynamicaly oriented was advanced and included theory selfexperience in the group and practice under supervision the s brought progress in the field of alcoholism treatment as well besides the therapeuticrehabilitative approach which developed in the network of health organizations there was an extensive growth of selfhelp groups socalled “clubs for alcoholics in treatment” psychotherapy principally group psychotherapy was given an important role in the integrative approach to treatment and rehabilitation of people with alcohol addiction  in the ’s a group of lacanian oriented theoreticians played an important role in popularizing psychoanalytic concepts through intensive translation work and through writing original papers mainly on theoretical psychoanalysis the leading figure of this group slavoj žižek  is nowadays the most popular and translated slovenian author in the world he linked psychoanalytic theory with philosophy and the critique of ideology and art during the same period in the ’s and ’s a blossoming of different psychotherapy approaches took place in the years  new psychotherapy approaches or schools began entering slovenia usually with initial seminars designed to offer an introduction and motivate possible candidates for further trainings the scope of these new offers with qualified foreign teachers increased and so did the number of interested candidates especially from the ranks of professional helpers who in psychotherapy saw either a chance to build on their professional competence or an alternative activity for personal fulfilment the collapse of communism and the balkan wars halted the initial development of new approaches the reasons were that some foreign teachers considered slovenia – also after the ten days’ war in  – a dangerous area and that the disintegration of yugoslavia decimated some training groups comprising members of different nations of the formerly uniform state the sociopolitical change in slovenia in the beginning of s coincided with the founding of eap and its efforts to define psychotherapy as an independent profession on a high professional level in  the slovenian umbrella organisation of psychotherapy  was founded which united seven associations and became a  member of eap at the same time psychotherapists’ society of slovenia grew out of the above mentioned psychotherapy section of medical society and united individual psychotherapists mostly psychodynamicaly oriented clinical psychologists and psychiatrists current state of psychotherapeutic service organization individual approaches or schools of psychotherapy in slovenia are mostly organized as societies some operate as institutes the training consists of three basic parts personal experience theory and practical work with clients under supervision however some of the societies have not been offering their members a sufficient quantity of integral training in accordance with the european certificate of psychotherapy ecp as yet therefore it is their priority to supplement their training possibilities and to bring them in accordance with the training standard of the ecp as far as training is considered all societies depend more or less on foreign teachers because they do not have enough teaching staff themselves therefore one of the societies’ priorities in the near future is how to develop training programmes with more slovenian teachers number structure and qualifications of psychotherapists at the moment it is still difficult to say how many psychotherapists there are in the umbrella organisation and in slovenia in general the umbrella organisation does not have a complete register of psychotherapists of single societies yet in the register of psychotherapists’ society there are around  psychotherapists and approximately  associated members most societies only have a small number of fully trained psychotherapists some of them are “grandparents” and some have completed their training abroad the majority of members in the societies are without completed training besides most therapists are employed in their original professions ie as clinical psychologists psychiatrists social workers education workers and their possibilities to work as psychotherapists differ they dedicate only a small part of their working hours or a part of their free time to psychotherapy so psychotherapy training improves their professional competence in their primary professions but they use it to a much smaller extent to practise psychotherapy in the narrow sense of the word thus only estimates of the total number of psychotherapists are possible for the time being we believe that in the umbrella organisation and in the psychotherapists’ society there are from  to  people with the professional identity of a psychotherapist since psychotherapy in slovenia was founded in the seventies as a subspecialization for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists these two professions are still the prevailing among the psychotherapists only more recent approaches in the late eighties began training other professions as well social workers social education workers occupational therapists teachers and others in the recent years when the umbrella organisation as well as the psychotherapists’ society have been offering propaedeutics also representatives of professions other than beside humanities have gained access to a psychotherapeutic training there is an agreement that basic professions of psychotherapists can be first of all medicine psychology education – pedagogyandragogy rehabilitation – occupation therapy sociology social work theology and anthropology  research there is no scientific research institute for the time being though there have been initiatives in this direction for quite some time given that single societies ie approaches have neither sufficient personnel nor financial means for operating such an institute it is intended to be operated by the umbrella organisation and also serve the needs of the individual approaches availability of psychotherapeutic service clients can contact a psychotherapist either on their own initiative or upon recommendation of their general practitioner or psychiatrist since the demand is much greater than the supply many clients remain without psychotherapeutic help only a minority of them is lucky enough to reach a psychotherapist working for the public health or social care system or in the private practice psychiatrists and clinical psychologists who offer psychotherapy as a part of their daily routine are employed mainly in psychiatric hospitals dispensaries of mental health and counselling centres for children and adolescents social workers at centres of social work offer counselling as a part of their daily routine many social workers have received training in various forms of psychotherapy and include this knowledge in their counselling but officially they are not allowed to do so and are not paid to do psychotherapy after the democratic shift in  the private practice was allowed in the field of medicine clinical psychology and social work today there are approximately  private psychiatrists  pedopsychiatrists and  clinical psychologists the national health insurance allows them psychotherapy and pays them for it no other professions social workers lets say can be paid to practice psychotherapy it is also interesting that only psychologists with the specialization in clinical psychology are allowed to do psychotherapy many psychologists who are interested in practicing psychotherapy legally cannot do it because it is very difficult to get a specialization in clinical psychology in the health care system there is no part state financing system there are no more than five psychotherapists in slovenia who earn their living with psychotherapy alone the patients who get psychotherapy from psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in the health system are treated free of charge ie the cost is covered by the national health insurance which pays the same for psychotherapy in the public or private sector  euros for individual analytic or behaviourcognitive therapy  minutes  euros for family and couple therapy for  therapist  min  euros for group therapy  members  min with one therapist or  euros if there are two therapists  euro for relaxation techniques  min and  euros for a so called “superficial measure”  min a few others have the luck of possessing sufficient financial means and may find a psychotherapist practising psychotherapy in his free time the charges for those clients who pay themselves range from  to  euros per hour of psychotherapy most of the clients can afford the lowest charge and most of the clients can’t afford the highest the psychiatric hospitals admit mainly people suffering from psychoses and alcoholism alcoholism and suicide were rife in the pre period and continue to be the two major social problems associated with personal vulnerability it is estimated that  people suffer from alcoholism a huge proportion in a country  of not more than two million inhabitants they constitute approximately  per cent of all psychiatric admissions like its neighbour hungary slovenia has the highest europeanworld rate of completed suicide around  persons per  famous slovene psychiatrist milčinski  laid grounds for suicide treatment in slovenia and attributed an important part of it to psychotherapy since most people with alcohol problems are motivated for symptomatic treatment only a small part of them is included in the treatment of alcoholism in psychiatric hospitals which is based on sociotherapy and psychotherapy  the treatment of psychotic patients is based predominantly on antipsychotic drugs while psychosocial rehabilitation is insufficient the regime includes formal occupational therapy therapeutic communities and group therapy in reality the psychiatric hospitals present a very medicalized environment with many negative effects of institutionalization where for example even volunteers are often not allowed to enter in spite of the fact that “many psychiatrists and psychologists are well educated not only in their own field but also in areas as philosophy many of them are distinguished authors and although in the past  to  years many health professionals have received training in various forms of psychotherapy relatively little effect is seen in the day to day running of psychiatric services”  the psychotherapeutic model hasn’t brought any essential changes to the predominant medical model in psychiatric hospitals there are also no psychotherapy wards or clinics for psychosomatic problems it is encouraging though that psychotherapy has found its way to all slovenian psychiatric hospitals and that it is gradually developing although there is still a lot of disbelief if not opposition in the psychiatric hospital covering the region of gorenjska for example a ward for behaviourcognitive therapy with eight beds was established in  where mainly anxiousdepressive disorders as well as eating disorders psychotic and personality disorders etc are successfully treated given our psychiatric hospitals financing system this ward is making a loss which is being compensated from the income of classical psychiatric wards financially therefore there is a paradox  the more involved and highquality the treatment is the worse it is paid and vice versa in elementary and secondary schools psychotherapy as a method is officially not allowed psychologists special pedagogues and social workers who work in schools are allowed to use psychotherapeutic elements only in special cases if there is a need for a brief treatment or a crisis intervention for example but they have to direct pupils and families to specialized institutions counselling centres for children and adolescents dispensaries of mental health pedopsychiatric clinics if they need psychotherapy in spite of the official guidelines many of the above mentioned professionals take it on themselves to build on their psychotherapeutic knowledge and skills mostly in gestalt reality behaviourcognitive and family therapy which help them in their everyday work in the communist period catholic church was excluded from the political arena but it remained a strong and influential institution after the democratic shift caritas was established and has organized psychotherapeutic training for its counsellors in the ’s at the moment faculty for theology is organizing a twoyear postgraduate study in marital and family therapy in the capital ljubljana there is a franciscan family center which has become quite popular during last years namely its leader father gostečnik  published some books in which he connects  in a popular way relational psychoanalysis and systemic psychotherapy with christian spirituality slovenian psychotherapy in a quantum leap the last three years seem to be especially important for the expansion of psychotherapy in slovenia namely important new projects promise to bring a quantum leap in its development faculty study of psychotherapy initiative for law on psychotherapy national network of centres for psychotherapy and psychotherapy journal the initiatives for these projects were closely connected to the fruitful collaboration of slovenian umbrella association with eap and with austrian colleagues at the sigmund freud university faculty study of psychotherapy in october  sigmund freud university sfu from vienna and slovenian umbrella association for psychotherapy have started with the faculty study of psychotherapy the enrolment is possible immediately after the secondary school which is organized in accordance with bologna process three levels – bachelor master doctor  parallel the special project team prepared the application for the accreditation of bachelor master and doctoral degree in psychotherapy slovenia the benefits of slovenian accreditation would be many for example student status the possibility of state concession with the reduction of study costs the innovative potential of the faculty study of psychotherapy is big and is opening many possibilities for the realisation of new goals for example the reduction of the insufficient number of psychotherapists in slovenia the integration of slovenian psychotherapeutic scene the improvement of the quality of the practice for example in the frame of faculty outpatient department the shortening and the simplification of the psychotherapy education bigger emphasis on psychotherapy research etc potential employability possibilities for masters in psychotherapy science will be in social and health care system in schools health truism in the field of psychosocial rehabilitation psychosocial help programmes palliative care psychosocial counselling in public private nonprofit organisations and international charity organisations initiative for law on psychotherapy in  the working group for law on psychotherapy from the representatives of slovenian umbrella association for psychotherapy and from psychotherapists’ society was established at the ministry of health to prepare a draft of law on psychotherapy after many intensive and controversial discussions it seems that the draft will be finished in autumn  and will be opened for public discussions the consensus was reached on some main points that are in accordance with eap strassbourg declaration national network of centres for psychotherapy as described above the accessibility of psychotherapy services in slovenia is low according to the increasing number of mental disorders slovenia would need at least  psychotherapists but there are only about  psychotherapists with appropriate qualifications and most of them dont work full time as psychotherapists also the students of psychotherapy and trainees dont have enough possibilities for supervised  practice so in  the umbrella organization stimulated by the psychotherapy faculty study project gave initiative for establishing the national network of centres of psychotherapy in spring  centres in ljubljana koper and nova gorica started to work and in autumn new centres in celje maribor and slovenj gradec will join the network will offer psychotherapy at a reasonable price  euros a session and also free service for socially deprivileged clients the centres will be connected to psychotherapy faculty project so that the students could practice under supervision the network counselling phone line already started and different projects which will embed psychotherapy in local communities are planned psychotherapy journal in  slovenian umbrella organization has launched the first specialized journal “kairos – slovenian journal of psychotherapy” in slovenian and english language  articles are published from all fields of psychotherapy as well as interdisciplinary articles and articles from neighbouring fields the main aim of the journal is to encourage the development of psychotherapy as the autonomous profession on the scientific basis in slovenia and abroad trying to compare psychotherapeutic services in both countries it is quite obvious from the comparison between austria and slovenia that the development of psychotherapy has some common characteristics the main phases of development or the main characteristics that stimulated the development were • development of different psychotherapy approaches • forming of the umbrella organisation that united different approaches for the sake of promoting psychotherapy as an autonomous profession • promotion of psychotherapy through publications • regulation of the field through the law on psychotherapy regulation of training through accreditation of training institutions licence system register of psychotherapists ethical control • integration of psychotherapy in the public health care system • building a global network of psychotherapists and psychotherapy organisations • integration of psychotherapy training to the academic world of universities and building a network of psychotherapy universities in the future slovenian psychotherapists have many more steps to do to integrate psychotherapy in the health care system good law on psychotherapy would be the crucial step learning from good austrian example can help them to make a good strategy that would of course also include the special characteristics of slovenian context exercise task  make an internet search on “psychotherapy law” and compare different law regulations of psychotherapy in europe for example austria germany italy  netherlands sweden uk and try to propose a model for further development of psychotherapy as an integral part of comprehensive health care in your country task  make a list of needed mental health services in your local area and explain the need of psychotherapy as an integral part of these services task  find a psychotherapist in or near your local community and make an interview about his or her practice pay special attention to the level of integration of his or her practice in the public health and social care system references  pritz a introduction into globalized psychotherapy in pritz a editor globalized psychotherapy vienna facultas universitätsverlag

are structured in three levels of ascending specialization referred to the expertise of the staff providing the service palliative care approach general palliative care and specialist palliative care

theoretical backround introduction until the last few decades most people died quickly following an infection or injury or soon after the initial symptoms of an advanced an untreatable condition like cancer diabetes or heart disease modern living conditions and advances in health care have ensured that most will die slowly and mostly in old age  in the line with aging of the population the pattern of diseases that people suffer and die from is also changing increasingly more people die as a result of serious chronic disease and older people in particular are more likely to suffer from multiorgan failure towards the end of life  diagnosing any one disease as the main cause of death can be difficult to do with certainty as many older people suffer from several conditions together that might all contribute to death dementia is an example of one condition that is regularly underdiagnosed the top five predicted causes of death for  are   heart disease  cerebrovascular disease including stroke  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  lower respiratory infections in situations with progressive dementia or other frailty conditions and  lung cancer population ageing and its implications are major public health issues for st century and palliative medicine and palliative care increasingly becoming more and more important definition and description of palliative care definitions of palliative care and palliative medicine the core of palliative care is well understood but because of the complexity of palliative care there are various definitions used around the world palliative care is defined by the world health organization as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with lifethreatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems physical psychosocial and spiritual  an important part of palliative care is palliative medicine according to european association for palliative care palliative medicine is the appropriate medical care of patients with advanced and progressive disease for whom the focus of care is the quality of life and in whom the prognosis is limited though sometimes may be several years palliative medicine includes consideration of the familys needs before and after the patients death   palliative care characteristics palliative care provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms affirms life regards dying as a normal process and intends neither to hasten nor prolong death palliative care integrates the psychosocial and spiritual aspects of patient care and offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death it also offers a support system to help family cope during the patient’s illness and their own bereavement using a team approach palliative care addresses the needs of patients and their families including bereavement counselling if necessary it enhances quality of life and may positively influence the course of the illness it is applicable early in the course of the clinical phase of the disease with other therapies also such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy and includes those investigations needed to understand distressing clinical complications figure  curative activities bereavement care palliative care diagnosis of disease symptom palliation activities and activities for better quality of life dying death figure  schematic presentation of placement of palliative care into clinical phase of natural course of disease palliative care should be offered as needs develop and before they become unmanageable why palliative care is a public health problem quality of care at the end of life is a global public health problem because of the large number people affected palliative care can with its patient centred care and selfmanagement orientation prevent needless suffering additionally it could have a potential to prevent morbidity in the bereaved the range of problems for different diseases people living with serious chronic diseases face a wide range of problems each disease brings specific symptoms  for example • ischemic heart disease may cause the chest pain of angina breathlessness and fatigue • stroke may cause difficulty moving or talking while  • chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may restrict activity because of breathlessness fatigue and depression chronic diseases often come together and so add up to cause many problems affecting the quality of people’s lives prevalence of problems in the last year of life is presented in figure  figure  prevalence of major problems in the last year of life  models of the typical disease trajectory for common serious chronic diseases according to lynn and adamson  models of the typical disease trajectory for common serious chronic diseases are as follows  trajectory  short period of evident decline typically cancer this entails a reasonably predictable decline in physical health over a period of weeks months or in some cases years figure  function high low death time figure  model of typical trajectory of an illness due to cancer source lynn and adamson    this course may be punctuated by the positive or negative effects of palliative oncological treatment most weight loss reduction in performance status and impaired ability for self care occurs in patients last few months with the trend towards earlier diagnosis and greater openness about discussing prognosis there is generally time to anticipate palliative needs and plan for end of life care this trajectory enmeshes well with traditional specialist palliative care services such as hospices and their associated community palliative care programmes which concentrate on providing comprehensive services in the last weeks or months of life for people with cancer resource constraints on hospices and their community teams plus their association with dying can limit their availability and acceptability  trajectory  long term limitations with intermittent serious episodes typically organ failure heart failure respiratory failure liver failure renal failure with conditions such as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients are usually ill for many months or years with occasional acute often severe exacerbations figure  function high death low time figure  model of a typical illness trajectory for organ failure such as heart failure source lynn and adamson   deteriorations are generally associated with admission to hospital and intensive treatment this clinically intuitive trajectory has sharper dips than are revealed by pooling quantitative data concerning activities of daily living each exacerbation may result in death and although the patient usually survives many such episodes a gradual deterioration in health and functional status is typical the timing of death however remains uncertain in one large study most patients with advanced heart failure died when expected to live for at least a further six months many people with end stage heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease follow this trajectory but this may not be the case for some other organ system failures  trajectory  prolonged dwindling typically dementia people who escape cancer and organ system failure are likely to die at an older age of either brain failure such as alzheimers or other dementia or generalised frailty of multiple body systems  this third trajectory is of progressive disability from an already low baseline of cognitive or physical functioning figure  function high death low time figure  model of a typical illness trajectory for dementia or frailty source lynn and adamson   such patients may lose weight and functional capacity and then succumb to minor physical events or daily social hassles that may in themselves seem trivial but occurring in combination with declining reserves can prove fatal this trajectory may be cut short by death after an acute event such as a fractured neck of femur or pneumonia clinical and organizational implications priority care needs for the three trajectories trajectories allow us to appreciate that doing everything that can be done for a possible cure may be misdirected the priorities are needed and priority care needs for the three illness trajectories are as follows   priority care needs for short period of evident decline mostly cancer are as follows • adapting services to rapid changes in the patient • controlling symptoms • providing support for families training respite and counselling through bereavement • ensuring continuity of the clinical team • life closure and completion  priority care needs for chronic illness with intermittent exacerbations and sudden dying organ system failure are as follows • preventing exacerbations and providing early treatment • planning for urgent situations • making decisions about the benefits of lowyield treatments • mobilizing services to the home • preparing families for sudden death  • life closure and completion  priority care needs for slow dwindling mostly frailty and dementia are as follows • fostering caregiver endurance loyalty and reliability • providing longterm personal care services and supervision • helping family caregivers to find meaning and avoid severe burdens • avoiding undesired prolongation of life • keeping skin intact • finding pleasurable moments to enjoy • life closure and completion palliative care services levels palliative care services are structured in three levels of ascending specialization these levels refer to the expertise of the staff providing the service  level one  palliative care approach palliative care approach is that palliative care principles should be appropriately applied by all health care professionals  level two – general palliative care at an intermediate level a proportion of patients and families will benefit from the expertise of health care professionals who although not engaged full time in palliative care have had some additional training and experience in palliative care  level three – specialist palliative care engaged in palliative care full time and palliative services are their core activities provided by an interdisciplinary team under direction of a consultant physician in palliative medicine palliative care services palliative care should be an integral part of health care and take place in any setting in each health area all three levels of services provision should be available in all care settings including acute general hospitals and the community services should be sufficiently flexible to allow movement of patients from one care setting to another depending on their clinical situation and personal preferences palliative care in the community the most palliative care is likely to be delivered in the primary care setting studies have indicated that people with terminal diseases spend most of their final year of life at home  one of the main principles in palliative care is to provide services to patients in a setting of their choice most people would prefer to die at their home  the development of community based palliative care services is vital in the future development of palliative care services in order to best meet the needs and personal preferences of patients with advanced cancer or progressive lifethreatening disease of other aetiologies the majority of care in the community is provided by a family physician and a community nurse and a specialized palliative care nurse can become involved in the care of patients with advanced incurable disease other disciplines are also involved in the care of patients in the community to varying degrees these include the physiotherapist the occupational therapist and social worker  there are many factors that prevent patients from receiving adequate care in the community and which result in the often unnecessary admission of patients to hospitals nursing homes or specialist palliative care units the main reason has been identified as a lack of support for carers in the community  although most of the last year of life is spent at home approximately  of patients dying from cancer are admitted to a hospital in their last year  specialist palliative care team hospital palliative care teams have evolved into specialist interdisciplinary consulting teams who offer advice and support to professional health care providers regarding the management of patients with progressive disease specialist palliative care team in the acute general hospital should consist of at least a consultant in palliative medicine a specialist palliative care nurse a social worker and a secretary specialist palliative units a particular hospital depending on the regional needs may designate a ward or a unit to function as the specialist palliative care unit for patients requiring specialist palliative care specialist palliative care team in such a unit consists of full interdisciplinary teams specialized physicians nurses social workers psychologist physiotherapist occupational therapist pharmacist dietician coordinator of spiritual care volunteers day care centres day care centres are usually attached to the specialist palliative care units they offer access to specialist care a change of environment for patients and respite for their families and carers above national palliative care programme guidelines or standards for specialist palliative care settings should be established which would ensure a national consistency of standards for all specialist palliative care centres hospice hospice is usually nongovernmental organization also with a holistic approach to the end of life care dependant on attitude expertise and understanding rather than a specific mechanism and setting it most often includes a house and inpatient unit but can be also organized as an institution with homecare teams and bereavement support only it can increase the sensitivity for more holistic proactive and anticipating approach towards the dying through individual treatment sincere communication attention to detail continuity of care and team work it is a concept of choice and empowerment at the end of life it is a concept of dignity autonomy and respect for the dying and the family it is a potential denominator for public change in attitudes behaviour and lifedecisions led by understanding and compassion it can also be an important link to promote palliative care in the wider community present status some countries are now developing national and regional palliative care strategies and each country needs to decide which options of care are their priorities that can be offered or planned for however if people do not receive information on what care is available it is difficult to argue that best care has been offered currently most health care systems  are not set up in a way that makes it easy for people to receive palliative care or to die where they would wish there is still too much unnecessary suffering at the end of life in contemporary society and inadequate services to relieve it through insufficient professional knowledge organizational possibilities through inexistent services network and lack of interest in palliative care another barrier to better development of palliative care is lack of policymakers interest in organizational and strategic planning for people with palliative care needs already at the present and in the future at the same time palliative care for nonmalignant diseases has been voted in british medical journal in april  as the area of health care in which doctors can make the greatest difference to patient care palliative care and the future the proportion of people in each trajectory will shift with medical advances and lifestyle changes • as people reduce smoking and otherwise prevent lethal cancer more people will live long enough to develop vascular and heart disease • to the extent that prevention through diet medications and exercise is effective for heart disease more people will live long enough to encounter dementia and frailty • dying from cancer tends to peak around seventy years of age and heart and lung disease about a decade later • most people who survive past eightyfive eventually need daily care and accumulate evidence of multisystem lack of reserves thus to the extent that prevention and early treatment are successful more people are likely to live their last years with frailty and dementia  in figure  major medical conditions before death for medicare

slovenia this case study is basing on policy paper entitled “organizing palliative care in slovene health care system” which represents the last overview concerning the status of palliative care in slovenia  epidemiological data some basic mortality and morbidity indicators in slovenia with approximately  million inhabitants there are around  deaths per year the life expectancy at birth is  years for men and  years for women  the three main causes of death in slovenia are cardiovascular diseases neoplasm and diseases of respiratory system  regarding neoplasm slovenia is a country with a middle size morbidity and mortality rate caused by cancer the leading cancer for the male population is lung cancer  out of all cancer sites in males and for the female population is breast cancer  out of all cancer sites in females  where majority of deaths occur according to data from  approximately  of all deaths in slovenia occur in hospitals and other institutions and  occur at home table   the situation is still approximately the same in present time table  place of death in slovenia in  source national public health institute   place of death number of deaths      health and social care institutions hospitals nursing homes home or other places total      table  epidemiological estimation of symptoms in the last year of life in slovenia  symptom confusion sleeplessness depression pain loss of appetite trouble breathing constipation vomiting patient anxiety family anxiety patients with cancer            patients with other terminal illnesses           additionally from the table  data we can estimate the most frequent symptoms in the last year of life based on the work of higginson  in this estimation we must be aware of the fact that patients often have many concurrent symptoms at the last days of life epidemiology  numbers and causes of death can give indication of need for palliative care especially when coupled with information on symptoms emotional social and spiritual problems with this approach we have to be aware of data inconsistencies and gaps eg recorded cause of death is subject of fashion or can be inaccurate in older people where there are multiple causes and different diseases have different patterns of progression but this simple approach can provide us with useful insight for planning and implementation purposes history and present state of palliative care in slovenia short history the hospice movement with home service and education programs started in the middle of the s in ljubljana the capital city of slovenia slowly then in about a decade palliative care started to penetrate the health care system present situation it is now present in seven cities in slovenia in three of them ljubljana maribor and celje their palliative care teams offer not just education to the public and volunteers for home support for the families but a whole range of palliative home care services this includes palliative nursing care social and psychological care for patients and their families at their homes nurses in each hospice in ljubljana maribor and celje are paid by the national health insurance company general practitioners and community nurses are not involved in organized palliative care initiatives yet a particular concern is that slovenia lacks around  primary care physicians and even more nurses at the present time the problem of palliative care implementation on the primary care level needs to be closely examined and solutions wisely proposed together with a sensitive evaluation of the possible reality all hospices together provide home care for around  patients annually they organize of workshops seminars and presentations there are around  volunteers working in the hospice organizations at the moment new groups of volunteers are trained every year bereavement services are organized in all hospices and there is also a traditional bereavement children’s group holiday every summer new regional organizations of hospice in different parts of slovenia are developing particularly for education on psychosocial topics for volunteers and the public hospice movement in slovenia serves as an important model of hospice and palliative care to be implemented into national health system pain programs like in other countries started much earlier in most hospitals than the palliative care programs there are outpatient pain clinics in nearly every hospital in slovenia main palliative care services in slovenia main palliative care services in slovenia are   the university clinic of respiratory and allergic diseases golnik has established a palliative care unit within a longterm care department of the hospital there is a palliative care team with a physician four nurses social worker psychologist and volunteers  the major institution for cancer patients institute of oncology ljubljana has recently established a department for palliative care  at general hospital jesenice few hospital beds are available for palliative care as well  the palliative care development institute was founded in  as a training and resource centre education research and advocacy the institute plays a crucial role in the strategic planning and policy development of palliative care on the national level palliative care policy the palliative care development institute in cooperation with the ministry of health prepared a national strategic plan for palliative but it is still in the process of wide discussion confirmation and ratification the national committee for palliative care at the ministry of health is overseeing and coordinating a pilot study on palliative care implementation in the health care system the process of developing standards of care for patients at the end of life is under way but still at an early stage in slovenia pain as the main palliative care problem pain is the major symptom for patients in need of palliative care and therefore drug consumption for pain treatment is an indirect indicator of the development of palliative care all the essential drugs for pain relief are available in slovenia with a normal procedure for prescribing figure  shows total morphine consumption in slovenia from   kilograms                                    figure  total consumption of morphine in slovenia in – source international narcotics control board    there was a sudden increase in opioid consumption after  most probably due to the activities listed previously and new pain relief drugs available on the market the decline in last three years demonstrates the need for regular extensive postgraduate education on pain management as compared to the rest of europe consumption of morphine in slovenia is at the global mean level but under the average european mean level in  figure  figure  consumption of morphine mgcapita in europe in  source international narcotics control board   a study of quality of care at the end of life at the oncology institute ljubljana presented at the international conference on palliative care in cancer ljubljana  showed a retrospective record analysis of quality of care for  patients in  for the last  months of life the results suggested that the documentation among health care professionals was incomplete and coordination often inappropriate  of patients received opioids with successful treatment to the goal of mean vas  in  of patients the major weak points in the care of patients at the oncology institute as compared to the literature were higher rates of prescriptions for antibiotics transfusions and parenteral hydration in the last days and lack of evaluation of the common symptoms in palliative care except pain eg breathlessness nausea vomiting tiredness etc no patient received chemotherapy albumin or vasoactive support in the last days of life in the documentation less data was available on other symptoms and especially about psychosocial problems of patients and their families no other symptoms except pain were evaluated by a scale so it was impossible to evaluate the effects of treatment as documented from the study it was more than obvious how urgent it is to put palliative care standards in  place the study indicated urgent need for extensive professional training a better documentation system and coordination among all professionals in the health system national guidelines for pain management have been published in  and have already been updated the whobook on pain and symptom management for children with cancer has been translated into slovenian in addition to the guidelines there was a successful educational campaign organized to train doctors and nurses all over the region on the basics of pain management the future of implementation of organized palliative care in slovenia reasons for slow implementation of nationally organized palliative care in slovenia the possible reasons for the absence of nationally organized effective palliative care programme in slovenia could be the historical development of the slovene society there has been long subjugation of the country to another’s rule our independence began only in  this situation through the centuries contributed to the development of a closed national character people are not used to discussing and solving their problems publicly the suicide rate in slovenia is one of the highest in europe in the period of socialism death was pushed into the sphere of the private and the church which was competing for the public’s attention would not enter the private sphere  there was no interest in the development of public institutions like palliative care units in hospitals or hospices there was a strict hierarchical organization of the health care system and the concept of team work was not developed nursing which is the most involved in the care of the dying patient still has little power because of its subordinate position within the health care system  medical doctors probably because of the lack of palliative care program during their study and lack of organizational solutions do not feel comfortable in the area of palliation and rather emphasize the curative approach finally there was a complete absence of financial support from the government for all nonacute diseases therefore also for the palliative care programswe could conclude that • the incidence of chronic and progressive diseases in slovenia compares to central european countries but not to their level of palliative care development palliative care is not organized nor sufficiently developed in the slovene health care system • in slovenia like in the majority of european countries the proportion of older population is increasing needs for palliative care will become larger  • statistical data about evaluation measures and quality of services in palliative care are not available and therefore not very reliable qualitative and financial estimations of costs for existing initiatives of palliative care are possible main issues and obstacles for strategies for the implementation of palliative care into national health system the main issues in palliative care for slovenia are   to develop common vision for palliative care for the people who need it now and for the growing population of elderly who will need it very soon  to produce common standards in palliative care  to introduce regular undergraduate and postgraduate education  to ensure better teamwork and continuity of care across all settings  to introduce efficient clinical and managerial solutions to ensure better health outcomes and patient satisfaction and  to bring better understanding that every clinical decision is also a financial decision and therefore responsibility in the clinical management should be introduced on the other side the main obstacles for the implementation of organized palliative care are  lack of knowledge and appropriate attitude among health care professionals  lack of organizational motivation to reach better health and satisfaction outcomes  lack of clearly defined common standards in palliative care  lack of understanding of team work and continuity of care  lack of the public understanding what palliative care is  lack of economic analyses on endoflife care  lack of governmental understanding of palliative care and its benefits and  lack of governmental recognition of the growing needs of patients with chronic and progressive diseases in the past and therefore lack of financial incentives common examples of attitudes presenting direct barriers to palliative care development are • “we are already providing this form of care” • “we do not have enough money for this development” • “we only need to train general practitioners” • “we already are starting nonacute departments where nurses are offering care to patients” • “in tertiary hospitals we should not have this type of patients” • “nursing homes should provide such services” such remarks are often heard and illustrate a range of individual and institutional barriers and lack of understanding of benefits which can be achieved to respond to this situation a combination of well trained palliative care teams with clear ideas and vision on the one hand are needed along with generic education and a change of attitudes with the ability to build on earlier successes in order to achieve worthwhile results as gomezbatiste et al  observed individual and institutional resistance might be very strong and it is vital to understand the reasons that underpin it and work towards achieving a consensus of views this can help to distinguish between palliative care services and for example pain clinic or oncology services in a context where palliative care standards have been clearly defined this is particularly important where there is a political dependency of one service on another rooted in local power positions once a number of good initiatives are underway however and this has been consolidated local experience is frequently the most effective rejoinder to criticism it then becomes possible to focus more on issues of extension and coverage  assessment of needs baseline studies to assess needs provide vital information on kinds of services that should be developed objective assessment of needs and analysis of baseline context is also crucial for effective monitoring of the results of a new initiative we can use a simple and pragmatic approach to estimate need in palliative care by higginson that has three components  • epidemiology • comparison with services available and • effectiveness and costeffectiveness analysis  national and local possible strategies for palliative care in slovenia there are three main options of possible strategies for palliative care in slovenia  no change in the current government policy or strategy this would most probably lead to a variety of very slowly evolving and differently formulated palliative care services on different levels of the health care system not being integrated into a useful network of the path of every patient without proper quality standards coverage equity possibilities for quality measures and planning towards meeting needs it would definitely be a very unsatisfactory experience for patients and their families and health care professionals as well it would also be possible to expect similar events of misuse and exploitation of the circumstances like the events in hotel črni les in the  as reported in the media inappropriate care and financial exploitation was discovered in the situation of absence of organized palliative care on the national level  incremental or modest policy change the development of palliative care units within nursing departments in every large hospital if new governmental policy helps alleviate some of the aspects of the current problem like supporting the development of longterm nursing departments in hospitals only and not acting strategically on all levels of health care where patients die very similar results to the first option can be expected public health goals coverage equity quality standard care efficiency and efficacy could not be reached in this way  radical policy alternatives by applying bold changes most if not all of the policy goals could be achieved to guide reforms many participants in health care should embark on an era of innovation evaluation and learning among those are clinicians educators insurance house provider organizations and government agencies together with the development of palliative care teams and patient advocacy organizations exercises task  carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module critically discuss the characteristics of palliative care services and their supportive
