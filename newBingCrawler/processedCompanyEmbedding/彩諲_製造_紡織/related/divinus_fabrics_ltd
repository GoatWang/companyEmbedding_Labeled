took longer to grow on me that some albums as a two steps and audiomachine fan at first at felt it was good but clearly there was good reason i dont hear about them as much as tsfh and audiomachine and their ilk in truth though their style just took a little bit of getting used to in the end i realized that i held this album in as high regard as any  in fact i think i spent more time listening to it that albums to almost any other of the genre they have some of the most epic choruses around  songs like darkest hour salvation and flame ashes the eleventh hour  some of the best choruses ive heard in the genre once you get used to the style maybe it helps that put their choruses so far in the foreground giving it proper emphasis their lighter stuff is less impressive though still good  healing of the nations name above all names eye of the beholder  but those are few and far between and for the most part divinus offers incredibly intense deep epic music they typically stick to the start slow then get intense then add super intense epic chorus for the finale once you get into the songs however the similar formula is of little consequence and the biggest problem really is that we could use more chorus especially in elohim which is just too short with a mere  seconds of amazing chorusso if you like epic contemporary classical you should really consider this album if youre a fan of epic choruses in paticular this is a must have read more top critical reviewsee the critical review›  people found this helpful  out of  starshalf way therebyred rogerson june  i thought this music would be a bit heavier due to the overall look of the album cover and the names of the tracks however it is mostly composed of lighter near epic music that never really seems to go all the way if they would have had a heavenly lighter picture on their album cover i think it would have perfectly conveyed the music withinthe music is never whimsical but it really isnt dramatic or heavy either in an epic music sense i would say that it is more background mood music as it never has seems to have the highs that accompany the epic music we are all accustomed to it gets really close on some tracks and then immediately tones itself back down i would say ultimately the album is a cross between new age mood music with some light epic overtones thrown in here and therea little too weak for me on all accounts but if that sounds good to you then this might be what you are looking for read more sort by topmost recenttopfilter by all reviewersverified purchase onlyverified purchase onlyall stars

one song that has the feel of the chapter i will be writing that day and then put it on softly in the background on autorepeat to help me visualize the action in that scene this album has provided the fertile ground for quite a few chapters and scenes in two different bookstheir is a light islamic feel not overwhelming to some of these pieces conjuring up images of a lonely desert an open landscape a journey loneliness an epic journey many pieces have a melancholy feel as though an obstacle needs to be overcome in most cases the score is evocative of a solution to a problemone piece is evocative of a native american tribe performing a shamanic ceremony a few others are light and inspirationaland then there are several really good evil bad guy pieces anybody who has ever written a good villain knows you need all the help you can get crawling into the bad guys head whether writing your villain the high school bully you are hosting a haunted house for halloween and want background mood music beyond the tired old haunted house soundtracks or you just want to put on some kickbutt music at the gym to pump some iron you will find what you need hereand if you just want to play the whole album and listen to orchestral scores the way that normal people listen to their music it is quite enjoyablecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products

comments right now please try again later out of  starsone way of telling a storybyvidaron november  format mp musicverified purchasealthough definitely not mood music this album is not always a harddriving heartstopping series of songs either taking into account the cover art and the names of the songs this album diverges from typical epic fare in that it appears to be intended to tell a specific story heaven versus hell unlike other cinematicstyle albums which tend to possess selfcontained songs that generally have nothing to do with each other divinus is more like a complete soundtrack for a movie that doesnt exist in that regard the story is told in the music if you care to hear it    but you have to hear the whole album to grasp the full story thats not to say there arent individual songs you can love and build unique imagery around for they do hold up under scrutiny but i think something will be lost if you try to look at the songs only as separate entities and not also as the unit they arecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found only products offered on amazon can
