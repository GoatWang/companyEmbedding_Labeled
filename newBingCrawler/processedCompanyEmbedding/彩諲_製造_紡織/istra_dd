reporthelpfulapartment milan is a wonderful spacious apartment very well equipped surrounded be a huge garden and with a nice pool for relaxing in the quiet of the istrian nature we had a wonderful holiday in apartment milan with milan and divna being exceptional hosts and taking excellent care of us and our children it was actually an agrotourism experience since we had the privilege of tasting milans excellent products direct from the farm and our children where allowed to participate in some farm activities like goat milking milan and divna were extremely welcoming paying attention to our needs while being discreet and respecting our privacy providing us everyday with fruit vegetables milk or cheese from the farm and giving us helpful tips they became like members of the family and we are grateful to them for all the special care we highly recommend the apartment and hope to be able to return next year more reporthelpfulsabineaugust  reporthelpfulgood communication before and during our stay very friendly and warm welcome by milan and his whole lovely family  we were treated like good friends perfect place to spend some time to relax and enjoy the countryside appartment very clean and equiped with really everything highlight milan made us taste his selfmade wine goatcheese and prosciuttoand we could see his little goats and taste some fresh warm goatmilk i highly recommend this place thanks a lot for these extraordinary moments   more reporthelpfulshenqiaugust  reporthelpfulalthough the host described the location of the apartment its not easy for us to find the apartment in a village the family is very friendly offer us juice and wine the apartment is beautiful and big enjoyed a great breakfast in the quiet morning more reporthelpfulthorstenaugust  reporthelpfulwhen we chose this place based on the internet description we didnt rally know what to expect but we couldnt have asked for a more perfect experience what milan divna ivana and anamarija actually provided went way above and beyond what one can expect the apartment is on the top floor of their family home and it has a fantastic view it is completely renovated in the old istrian style so it is both functional and very pretty they have a small working farm with goats a dog wild cats and fields of crops and we were welcomed to participate as much or as little as we wanted in the daily chores they especially took an interest in our children  and  years old and played with them as often as they could they have a small pool which we all enjoyed playing in to cool off at the end of a day out and a huge gardenbackyard which they basically turned over to us for the entire time of our stay this included offering us use of their barbecue and various outdoor toys for the kids their farm is centrally located so that it was possible to visit all of the major attractions for tourists with families in istria with only a  minute drive while milan and his family were extremely welcoming and took time out to get to know us and offer us hospitality they speak both german and english they also gave us our private space so that we could do what we wanted on our holiday they welcomed us to such an extent that when we left it felt as if we were leaving family they even remembered that our daughters birthday was  days after we left and sent her a birthday sms for anyone who is looking for a vacation on a farm type of holiday in a welcoming family atmosphere and in a particularly attractive location in istria out of the numerous apartments for rent we would recommend
