products specifically made for babies toddlers and teenagers up to sixteen years old therefore he came up with a new label called armani junior with a separate label within the product line entitled armani baby the armani junior brand was introduced in  the sublabel was often criticized in the public eye because armani occasionally used real fur for the armani junior autumn and winter collections many people tend to think that its unreasonable for a large amount of the public to dress small children in highend luxury clothing which families with a regular or even comfortable income cannot afford the junior line consists of baby clothing and accessories as well as tshirts pullovers suits smokings shoes hats shirts belts bags underwear and accessories for children and teenagers this armani line is often viewed as the direct competitor of the italian luxury brand versaces young versace armani junior has  independent boutiques around the globe which only sell the sublabel  the label is also sold in other stores by the label including armanicasa armani jeans or emporio armani in total  independent and franchise armani stores sell the armani junior and armani baby products

launched his interior design collection in  with a flagship store opening in milan italy the same year when armani was asked about why he wanted a furniture line armani said that he wanted people to design their own private home designing this furniture and home collection helped me to stimulate my creative and artistic vein armani said critics responded very positively to the armanicasa label calling the style simply elegant a little retro with ethno elements to it a lot of critics also liked the fact that there are only a few ornaments used but with artistic detail which seem to have a tremendous effect on the style and furniture itself armani collaborates with rubelli and the molteni group to build the home collection as the architectural digest reported in february  that armanicasa includes stateoftheart kitchens sold under the armanidada name – a partnership with molteni group as well as luxurious fabrics produced in collaboration with rubelli armaniroca is yet another partnership which provides giorgio armani with bathroom furniture and accessoires the sublabel consisting of variegated products is sold in  independent armani stores as well as selected
