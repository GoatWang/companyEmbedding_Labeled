of  million to reduce the balance of deferred revenue related to the assumed client contracts acquired from scout analytics as a result of this adjustment  million of revenue was not recognized for the three months ended september   therefore revenue is adjusted by an increase of  million to arrive at nongaap revenue for the three months ended september   b stockbased compensation included in our gaap presentation of cost of revenue and operating expenses stockbased compensation consists of expenses for stock options and awards and purchase rights under our stock purchase plan we exclude stockbased compensation expense from our nongaap measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as it is a noncash expense c amortization of internallydeveloped software included in our gaap presentation of cost of revenue and operating expenses amortization of internallydeveloped software reflects noncash expense for certain software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use we exclude these expenses from our nongaap measures because we believe they are not indicative of our core operating performance d amortization of purchased intangibles included in our gaap presentation of gross margin and operating expenses is amortization of purchased intangible assets we believe amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names and customer relationships as items arising from preacquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period e acquisition related costs included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and acquisition bonus payments these are onetime costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance f restructuring and other expense   included in our gaap presentation we will incur expenses with our ongoing restructuring effort to reduce expenses to better match revenues  restructuring and other expenses consist primarily of employees severance payments related employee benefits retention bonuses and charges related to cancellation of contracts these are onetime in nature costs that are not indicative of our core operating performance g goodwill impairment included in our gaap presentation we recorded goodwill impairment related to our cloud and business intelligence unit in  goodwill impairment is a noncash charge that is one time in nature that is not indicative of our core operating performance h noncash interest expense under gaap we are required to separately account for liability debt and equity conversion option components of the  million convertible senior notes that were issued in august  accordingly for gaap purposes we are required to recognize effective interest expense on our convertible senior notes which includes interest cost related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and the contractual  interest rate of the note the difference between the effective interest expense and the contractual interest expense is excluded from our assessment of our operating performance because we believe that this noncash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance we believe that the exclusion of the noncash interest expense provides investors a view of our core operating performance i income tax effect on nongaap adjustments as well as the impact of normalizing the effective income tax rate this adjusts i the provision
