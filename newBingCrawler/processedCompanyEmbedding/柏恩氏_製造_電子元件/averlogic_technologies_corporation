averlogic to showcase hd streaming over power lines at computex    taipei april   with computex  fast approaching videoaudio solution provider averlogic technologies is gearing up to showcase an exciting h hd av streaming over powerline product along with other powerline streaming solutions including audio streaming and an ip network camera these demonstrations will give visitors a chance to witness the latest technology used to employ existing home power lines to transmit video and audio “for piping videoaudio throughout your home plc power line communications offers many advantages compared to wireless” says averlogic ceo kyle chang these advantages include farther transmission distances more security and less noise  another alternative is portable video ce devices but of course they are often burdened with heavy batteries and are cumbersome to transport from room to room that is why averlogic chooses plc as the best choice for streaming hd video throughout the home hd streaming over existing power lines – no extra wiring necessary power is a basic requirement for any home videoaudio ce device these devices whether video sources or video displays must be located near power outlets since most rooms are equipped with outlets it makes sense to employ existing power lines for streaming hd video from source to display throughout your entire home no need for hassling with extra wiring aside from the convenience and cost savings not many realize that interference in power lines are actually less than current wireless solutions especially those using  ghz band for wireless applications additionally powerline transmission compared to wireless also covers more distance m vs m  floors vs  floors is not limited by wallstructure interference and is less prone to security breaks averlogic’s h hdmi p hd av streaming over powerline module consists of a transmitter tx and a receiver rx  it allows hcompressed hd up to x at frame rates of p or i video and audio digital signals to stream from your av equipment eg bluray disc™ player video game console like ps hd dvd or stb to any compatible hdtv the combination of h codec media network controller and plc technologies make the video and audio content stream smoothly data size up to mbps and for long distances from st to rd floor with rc or src construction one transmitter in the living room can deliver signals to  receivers in  different rooms the receiver module allows manufacturers easy integration into an hdtv design via hdmi™ interface and it avoids the hassles of wiring between your av transmitter and receiver equipments it basically supports  sources hdmi x   ypbpr x   cvbs x  which can all be controlled by the transmitterincluded remote at the receiver side other audiovideo streaming solutions over powerlines averlogic will also demonstrate its “streaming ipod   khz audio over powerline” solution and a wallmounted audio sender and receiver product these reference designs
