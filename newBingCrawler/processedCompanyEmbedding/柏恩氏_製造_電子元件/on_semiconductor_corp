company issued the following news release on semiconductor nasdaq on driving energy efficient innovations announced today that the iot development kit idk has won a  iot evolution product of the year award from iot evolution magazine and iot evolution world the leading magazine and website covering internetofthings iot technologiesthe idk is a fully configurable platform that enables engineers to design and offer differentiated iot products and systems for a broad range of end applications including smart homebuilding smart city industrial automation and mhealthwe are excited to have the idk recognized as a top product of the year for iot evolution said wiren perera who heads iot at on semiconductor on semiconductor continues to drive the progression of iot by providing energy efficient hardware and software elements coupled with the node to cloud platforms to enable design engineers to evaluate prototype and deploy iot products and solutions to market with greater speed and efficiency and with fewer design iterationsthe idk baseboard features on semiconductors advanced ncs systemonchip soc with a bit armr cortexrm core running the arm mbed os by attaching different daughter cards to the idk baseboard a wealth of connectivity sigfox ethernet  based radios enabling zigbee and thread protocols etc sensor motion ambient light proximity heart rate etc and actuator stepper brushless motor drivers led drivers options can be added to the system this means that compromises do not have to be made and the most suitable technology for a specific application can be chosenthe hardware is complemented by an eclipsebased integrated development environment ide that includes a c compiler debugger and code editor design engineers are further supported in their evaluation and product development via a comprehensive set of application examples use cases and related libraries in addition to the default cloud software platform support for industry standard cloud connectivity protocols mqtt and rest allow utilization of other widely used iot cloud service providersthe solutions selected for the iot evolution product of year award reflect the diverse range of innovation driving the machine to machine market today it is my honor to congratulate on semiconductor for their innovative work and superior contribution to the rapidly evolving iot industry said carl ford ceo of crossfire media a copublisher of iot evolutionit is my pleasure to recognize the idk an advanced solution that earned on semiconductor the  iot evolution product of the year award said rich tehrani ceo tmc i look forward to seeing more innovation from on semiconductor in the futurethe winners of the  iot evolution product of the year award will be published in the next
