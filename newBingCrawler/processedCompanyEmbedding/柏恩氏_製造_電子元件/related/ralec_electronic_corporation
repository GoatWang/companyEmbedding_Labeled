every adjacent two of the slits  is formed to extend from and penetrate through the lateral sides   respectively description this invention relates to a method for manufacturing a passive component more particularly to a method for manufacturing a chip resistor referring to figs  and  a conventional method for manufacturing a conventional chip resistor  includes the following steps first a metal sheet is rolled and trimmed to obtain a plurality of metal strips two electrode strips are electroformed on opposite sides of each metal strip each metal strip is cut to obtain a plurality of resistor sections each having two electrodes  then a plurality of slits  are formed on each resistor section and extend in a longitudinal direction l thereby obtaining a resistor main body  having a pair of ends  that are opposite to each other in a transverse direction t perpendicular to the longitudinal direction l and that are electrically and respectively connected to the electrodes  every adjacent two of the slits  extend from and penetrate lateral sides of the resistor main body  respectively thereby forming a circuitous current path and achieving a desired resistance value of the conventional chip resistor  finally opposite surfaces of the resister main body  are coated respectively with two coating layers  to obtain the conventional chip resistor  the resistance value of a resistor is directly proportional to a product of an electrical resistivity of the material of the resistor and a length of current path and is inversely proportional to a crosssectional area of the resistor in thickness accordingly in order to increase the resistance value of the conventional chip resistor  the thickness of the resistor main body  is decreased andor a number of the slits  is increased for lengthening the length of a current path resulting in a relatively weak structural strength of the conventional chip resistor  moreover since the coating layers  cover the opposite surfaces of the resistor main body  it is difficult to dissipate heat generated by the resistor main body  and temperature of the conventional chip resistor  is thus increased dramatically during use as a consequence the resistance value and the resister characteristic of the conventional chip resistor  is affected adversely due to the increased temperature additionally the coating layers  have to be made of a heatresistant material and thus manufacturing cost of the conventional chip resistor  is increased the object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a chip resistor having relatively good structural strength and capable of dissipating heat effectively according to this invention the method comprises the following steps of a sandwiching an electricinsulating material layer between an electricconducting material layer and a heatdissipating material layer to form a semiproductb forming a plurality of resistor sections arranged in an array on the semiproduct by forming a plurality of first slots through the semiproduct the first slots extending in a first direction and being arranged in a plurality of rows each row including a plurality of adjacent pairs of the first slots and forming a plurality of second slots through the semiproduct the second slots extending in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction and being arranged in a plurality of columns each adjacent pair of the second slots cooperating with a corresponding adjacent pair of the first slots to surround and define one of the resistor sections each of the resistor sections having a first layer which is a segment of the electricconducting materiallayer a second layer which is a segment of the heatdissipating material layer and a sandwiched layer which is a segment of the electricinsulating material layerc for each resistor section forming a plurality of slits on the second layer of the resistor section to form a resistor main body the slits extending in the first direction and being arranged and spaced apart from one another in the second direction the resistor main body having a pair of ends opposite to each other in the second direction and corresponding respectively to a pair of the first slots that define the resistor sectiond for each resistor section forming at least one dividing slot on the third layer of the resistor section the dividing slot

second directione for each resistor section forming two electrodes that are electrically and respectively connected to the ends of the resistor main body andf trimming each of the resistor sections to obtain a chip resistor other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the invention with reference to

referring to fig  a preferred embodiment of a method of manufacturing a chip resistor is shown to include the following steps as shown in fig  in step s an electricinsulating material layer  is sandwiched between an electricconducting material layer  and a heatdissipatingmaterial layer  to forma semiproduct  by the following substeps in substep s a heatconductive polymer material is coated on one of the electricconducting material layer  and the heatdissipating material layer  in substep s the other one of the electricconducting material layer  and the heatdissipating material layer  is stacked on the heatconductive polymer material in substep s the electricconducting material layer  and the heatdissipating material layer  are heated under a vacuum condition to solidify the heatconductive polymer material serving as the electricinsulating material layer  thereby forming the semiproduct  further referring to figs  and  in step s a plurality of resistor sections  arranged in an array are formed on the semiproduct  by the following substeps in substep s a plurality of first slots  are formed through the semiproduct  the first slots  extend in a longitudinal direction l and are arranged in a plurality of rows each row of the first slots  includes a plurality of adjacent pairs of the first slots  in substep s a plurality of second slots  are formed through the semiproduct  the second slots  extend in a transverse direction t perpendicular to the longitudinal direction l and are arranged in a plurality of columns each adjacent pair of the second slots  cooperate with a corresponding adjacent pair of the first slots  to surround and define one of the resistor sections  each of the resistor sections  has a first layer  which is a segment cut from the electricconducting material layer  a second layer  which is a segment cut from the heatdissipating material layer  and a sandwiched layer  which is a segment cut from the electricinsulating material layer  referring to fig  in step s for each resistor section  a plurality of slits  are formed on the first layer  of the resistor section  by masking and etching to form a resistor main body  the slits  extend in the longitudinal direction l and are arranged and spaced apart from one another in the transverse direction t the resistor main body  has a pair of ends  and a pair of lateral sides   the ends  are opposite to each other in the transverse direction t and correspond respectively to an adjacent pair of the first slots  in the row that define the resistor section  the lateral sides   parallelly extend in the transverse direction t and opposite to each other in the longitudinal direction l every adjacent two of the slits  extend from and penetrate through the lateral sides   respectively by this configuration current flows through the resistor main body  along a serpentine current path ie a zigzag current path and a desired resistance value of the chip resistor made by the method of this embodiment can be achieved note that although the resistor main body  is formed with three slits  in this embodiment the number of the slits  can be varied according to a desired resistance value in other embodiments referring to fig  in step s for each resistor section  a dividing slot  is formed on the second layer  of the resistor section  by masking and etching to from a heat dissipating layer  the dividing slot  divides the second layer  of the resistor section  into two portions that are spaced apart from each other in the transverse direction t and is formed to have two segments  which form an obtuse angle therebetween and each of which extends inclinedly from one of the lateral sides   toward the other one of the lateral sides   referring to fig  in step s for each resistor section  two electrodes  are formed to be electrically and respectively connected to the ends  of the resistor main body  by masking and electroplating finally in step s each of the resistor sections  is trimmed from the semiproduct  to obtain the chip resistor  illustrated in figs  to  as shown in figs  to  each chip resistor  includes the resistor main body  made of the first layer  the heat dissipating layer  made of the second layer  an insulating layer  made from the sandwiched layer  and the electrodes  the insulating layer  is electrically insulating the heat dissipating layer  from the resistor main body  the heat dissipating layer  is for dissipating heat generated by the resistor main body  during use of the chip resistor  and the electrodes  are electrically connected to an electronic device such as a circuit board not shown the electricinsulating material layer  has relatively great thermal conductivity and is made of a polymer material such as polypropylene so that the insulating layer  thus made facilitates conduction of the heat generated by the resistor main body  to the heat dissipating layer  the electricconducting material layer  and the heatdissipating material layer  are made of a material selected from the group consisting of copper aluminum copper alloy aluminum alloy and copper aluminum alloy since the heat dissipating layer  is formed with the dividing slot  current will not flow through the heat dissipating layer  in use current flows from one of the electrodes  through the resistor main body  via the current path see fig  toward the other one of the electrodes  the heat generated by the resistor main body  can be effectively transmitted through the insulating layer  to the heat dissipating layer  and then is dissipated to the ambient as a result the temperature of the chip resistor  remains relatively low as compared to the conventional chip resistor  and the resistance value and resistance characteristic of the chip resistor  are not affected additionally since the heat dissipation capability of the chip resistor  is relatively good it is not necessary to select a heatresistant material for manufacturing the chip resistor  thereby reducing manufacturing cost the resistance value of the chip resistor  is determined by the material of the resistor main body  a crosssectional area of the resistor main body  and a length of the current path when the thickness of the resistor main body  is reduced andor the number of slits  formed on the resistor main body  is increased in order to increase the resistance value of the chip resistor  the structural strength of the chip resistor  can be ensured by virtue of the heat dissipating layer  that is made of metallic material additionally since the dividing slot  extends across one of the slits  there is no stress concentration on the resistor main body  and the heat dissipating layer  as a result the chip resistor  of the present invention can be applied to a wider range of resistance values referring to figs  and  two modifications of the dividing slot   can be made by modifying a mask for etching in step s as shown in fig  the dividing slot  is formed to have a plurality of segments  in a zigzag arrangement and every adjacent two of the segments  form an obtuse angle therebetween as shown in fig  two dividing slots  are formed on the heat dissipating layer  by etching two dividing slots  on the second layer  of the resistor section  in step s the dividing slots  divide the heat dissipating layer  into three spacedapart portions in the transverse direction t and two of them extend across two of the slits  respectively to sum up by virtue of the heat dissipating layer  that facilitates heat dissipation of the resistor main body  during use the temperature of the chip resistor is relatively low as compared to the conventional chip resistor  illustrated in figs  and  thus the resistance value and the resistance characteristic of the chip resistor  remain stable and the material for making the chip resistor  may not be a heatresistant material thereby reducing manufacturing cost additionally heat dissipating layer  made of metallic material ensures the structural strength of the chip resistor  when the thickness of the resistor main body  is reduced andor the number of slits  is increased
