stream the company has incurred losses for the three months ended march   as of march   the company has an accumulated deficit of  the company has had negative cash flows from operating activities of  for the three months ended march   these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern   management has plans to address the company’s financial situation as follows   in the near term management plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the company’s business plan related to the bluetoothenabled ibeacon compatible technology management will continue to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the company’s financial obligations there is no assurance however that lenders and investors will continue to advance capital to the company or that the new business operations will be profitable the possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential inability to achieve profitability raises doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   in the long term management believes that the company’s projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the company that will be used to finance the company’s future growth however there can be no assurances that the company’s efforts to raise equity and debt at acceptable terms or that the planned activities will be successful or that the company will ultimately attain profitability the company’s longterm viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt or equity funding to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations and the ability of the company to achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations   principles of consolidation  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mobiquity technologies inc formerly known as ace marketing  promotions

march   and  and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended march   and  have been prepared by us without audit and in accordance with the requirements of form q and therefore they do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in our opinion the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects our financial position as of march   results of operations for the three months ended march   and  and cash flows for the three months ended march   and  all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature the results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year we have evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this form q with the sec and determined there have not been any events that have occurred that would require adjustments to our unaudited condensed financial statements   the information contained in this report on form q should he read in conjunction with our form k for our fiscal year ended december     estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments the company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability as the case may be in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level   the following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value     · level   observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   · level   inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means   · level   unobservable inputs reflecting the companys assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value these assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available   the carrying amounts of the companys financial assets and liabilities such as cash prepaid expenses other current assets accounts payable  accrued expenses certain notes payable and notes payable  related party approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   the company accounts for its derivative liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis under level          level      level      level      total     fair value of derivatives      –            –           embedded conversion features   the company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under asc  derivatives and hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion features should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings if the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under asc  the instrument is evaluated under asc  debt with conversion and other options for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature   derivative financial instruments   the company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting related to four convertible notes issued and outstanding totaling  which included a ratchet provision in the conversion prices which range between  embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the company’s balance sheet the company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change the company has estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a multinomial lattice model as of march   the fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter which resulted in a gain of  and derivative expense of  during the three and months ended march   as of march   the fair market value of the derivatives aggregated  using the following assumptions estimated  to year term estimated volatility of  to  and a discount rate of  to             cash and cash equivalents include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of march   and december   these securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as level  within our fair value hierarchy   the carrying amounts of financial instruments including accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities and promissory note approximated fair value as of march   and december   because of the relatively shortterm maturity of these instruments and their market interest rates no instruments are carried at fair value   cash and cash equivalents  the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less as well as bank money market accounts to be cash equivalents as of march   and december   the balances were  and  respectively   concentration of credit risk  financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents   concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the companys customer base and their dispersion across geographic areas principally within the united states the company routinely addresses the financial strength of its customers and as a consequence believes that its receivable credit risk exposure is limited   the company places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions at times the company maintains bank account balances which exceed fdic limits as of march   and december   the company exceeded fdic limits by  and  respectively   revenue recognition — the company recognizes revenue for all revenue streams when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with asc  revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met     · persuasive evidence for an agreement exists   · service has been provided   · the fee is fixed or determinable and   · collection is reasonably assured   ace marketing — ace marketings revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in general title passes to our customers upon the customers receipt of the merchandise revenue is recognized on a gross basis since ace marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership latitude in selection of vendors and pricing and bears all credit risk advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits ace marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold when incurred additional source of revenue derived from emailstexts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided   mobiquity networks – revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale the customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign which are normally in short duration periods the second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data revenue from data can occur in two ways the first is a direct feed which is billed at the end of each month the second way is through the purchasing of audience segments when an audience segment is purchased we bill the buyer upon delivery which is usually  days for the order date                allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectability of

depreciation is expensed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets leasehold improvements are being amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the remaining term of the lease the costs of additions and improvements which substantially extend the useful life of a particular asset are capitalized repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account and the gain or loss on disposition is reflected in operating income   long lived assets  longlived assets such as property equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset the fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows market value of similar assets if available or independent appraisals if required if the carrying amount of the longlived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset when fair values are not available the company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets the company recognized  impairment losses for the period ended december   and  for the period ended march     website technology  website technology developed during the prior years were capitalized for the period of development and testing expenditures during the planning stage and after implementation have been expensed in accordance with asc    advertising costs  advertising costs are expensed as incurred for the three months ended march   and march   there were advertising costs of  and  respectively   accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the company uses the blacksholes optionpricing model to determine fair value of the awards which involves certain subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term the estimated volatility of the companys common stock price over the expected term volatility and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed forfeitures changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stockbased compensation and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations refer to note  stock option plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for a more detailed discussion   beneficial conversions  debt instruments that contain a beneficial conversion feature are recorded as deemed interest to the holders of the convertible debt instruments the beneficial conversion is calculated as the difference between the fair values of the underlying common stock less the proceeds that have been received for the debt instrument limited to the value received   foreign currency translations  the companys functional and reporting currency is the us dollar we own a subsidiary in europe our subsidiarys functional currency is the euro all transactions initiated in euros are translated into us dollars in accordance with asc  translation of financial statements as follows     i monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the

  adjustments arising from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss therefore translation adjustments are not included in determining net income loss but reported as other comprehensive income   income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities for which income tax or tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   recently issued accounting pronouncements   we have reviewed the fasb issued accounting standards update asu accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods the company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally

forwardlooking statements   company overview   mobiquity technologies inc a new york corporation the “company” is the parent company of two operating subsidiaries mobiquity networks inc“mobiquity networks” and ace marketing  promotions inc “ace marketing” the company’s whollyowned subsidiary mobiquity networks has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising technology company focused on driving awareness and foottraffic throughout its indoor mallbased beacon network into a next generation mobile location data and marketing company mobiquity networks provides precise unique atscale locationbased data and insights on consumer’s real world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research with our combined data sets of shopping malls premium outlets and cinemas beacon data and first party location data via our advanced software development kit “sdk” utilizing multiple geolocation technologies mobiquity networks provides one of the most accurate and scaled solution for mobile data collection and analysis mobiquity networks is seeking to create several new revenue streams from the mobile data collection and analysis including but not limited to push notification campaigns mobile audiences  segments realtime data provision attribution reporting and custom research the company is also attempting to reduce expenses by renegotiating certain mall developer agreements   ace marketing is our legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers while ace marketing currently represents substantially all of our revenue we anticipate that activity from ace marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our mobiquity networks business we believe that our mobiquity networks business represents our greatest growth opportunity going forward   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements                revenue recognition  ace marketing’s revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in general title passes to our customers upon shipment of the merchandise revenue is recognized on a gross basis since ace marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership latitude in selection of vendors and pricing and bears all credit risk advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits ace marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold when incurred additional source of revenue derived from emailstexts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided   revenue recognition – mobiquity networks revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale the customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign which are normally in short duration periods the second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data revenue from data can occur in two ways the first is a direct feed which is billed at the end of each month the second way is through the purchasing of audience segments when an audience segment is purchased we bill the buyer upon delivery which is usually  days for the order date    allowance for doubtful accounts  we are required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations as to the realizability of our accounts receivable we make these assessments based on the following factors a historical experience b customer concentrations customer credit worthiness d current economic conditions and e changes in customer payment terms   accounting for stock based compensation  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the company uses the blacksholes optionpricing model to determine fair value of the awards which involves certain subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term “volatility” and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stockbased compensation and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations   plan of operation   mobiquity networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above all of the products used to derive revenue for the company are reliant on the collection of data to achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward we have developed a strategy to increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection one strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on a monthly basis “mau” and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations places available to see our mau’s visit over the same time period we are currently seeing approximately  unique mobile devices by the mau on a monthly basis and roughly  unique devices for the first  days of  the ability to see and collect the data required from these unique devices comes from the installation of our proprietary software development kit sdk into third party mobile applications apps to continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis we need to have our sdk installed in more third party apps we believe our unique offering to potential app partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry the task of partnering with third party apps for installation of our sdk is handled internally by our business development team   as of march   we had approximately  places in our proprietary places database and that number should increase to over  places by the end of the second quarter  thus exponentially increasing the amount of data we collect we have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies the task of growing our places database is handled by our internal technology team the company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings management intends to hire additional sales personnel in the last three quarters of  as working capital permits   results of operations   the following table sets forth certain selected unaudited condensed statement of operations data for the periods indicated in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues the following discussion relates to our results of operations for the periods noted and is not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any other interim period or any future fiscal year in addition we note that the periodtoperiod comparison may not be indicative of future performance                    three months ended march                revenue             cost of revenues             gross profit loss

our mobiquity revenue streams from collection of data and analysis is fairly new at the current time revenues mobiquity networks are  of our consolidated revenues in  we anticipate our revenues increasing in our mobiquity networks subsidiary due to the implementation of our new revenue business model    cost of revenues was  or  of revenues in the first quarter of  compared to  or  of revenues in the same fiscal period of the prior year cost of revenues includes purchases and freight costs associated with the shipping of merchandise to our customers the change in cost of revenues of  in  is related to volume and product mix of the products our customers purchased along with the establishment of our mobiquity devices   gross profit was  for the first quarter of  or  of net revenues compared to  in the same fiscal period of the prior year or  of revenues gross profits will vary periodtoperiod depending upon a number of factors including the mix of items sold and the volume of product sold also it is our practice to pass freight costs on to our customers with low to no profit margin as advertising revenue from the use of our mobiquity devices increases it is expected that our margins will increase significantly as our mall network has only recently been constructed and is currently being expanded at the current time revenues from the use of our mobiquity devices are not a material portion of our consolidated revenues   selling general and administrative expenses were  for the first quarter of  compared to  in the comparable period of the prior year a decrease of approximately  such operating costs include payroll and related expenses commissions insurance rents fee payments to simon property group macerich malls and ggp malls professional consulting and public awareness fees   the net operating loss for the first quarter of  was  as compared to  for the comparable period of the prior year the change in operating loss is attributable to reductions in salaries rents commissions and noncash stock based compensation   no benefit for income taxes is provided for in the reported periods due to the full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets our ability to be profitable in the future is dependent upon the successful introduction and usage of our proximity marketing services   liquidity and capital resources   the

stock for the quarter ended march     our company commenced operations in  and was initially funded by our three founders each of whom has made demand loans to our company that have been repaid since  we have relied primarily on equity financing from outside investors to supplement our cash flow from operations                  we anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to finance our accounts receivable and inventories hire additional sales persons capital expenditures and possible acquisitions the primary sources of funding for such requirements will be cash generated from operations raising additional capital from the sale of equity or other securities and borrowings under debt facilities which currently do not exist we believe that we can generate sufficient cash flow from these sources to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months in the event we should need additional financing we can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all   recent financings   in  and  we have completed the various financing summarized below   date   dollar amount      of securities sold

help marketers and researchers better find and understand their audiences all of our data is first party supplied by our sdk installed within dozens of class a app partners apps first party data is considered the most valuable and accurate that can be collected from an sdk all data provided by mobiquity networks is deterministic with a high degree of accuracy and precision   mobiquity networks’ data is unique for the following reasons   ·      massive scale  million plus unique devices ·      unique exclusive data from our owned  operated network of beacons in class “a” malls shopping outlets and cinemas in the united states indoor locations represent approximately  of major retail locations ·      data density  plus data points collected per userday ·      spatial precision  accurate within less than  feet ·      verified visits frequency and dwell time in store utilized to determine real consumer visits ·      diverse datafound in dozens of mobile apps that utilize precise location and ·      privacy compliant all user privacy is one hundred percent compliant and transparent   mobiquity networks determines a location visit by utilizing all the location sensors built into a mobile device gps bluetooth wifi and motion sensors to be considered a verified visit a device must have triggered an enter location event gps wifi bluetooth had a set amount of accuracy to the location event and dwelled at the location for a set amount of time a typical definition of a verified visit would be a device that was seen at a location in the last  days dwelled at the location for a minimum of  minutes and had a high degree of accuracy                strategy   mobiquity networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above all of the products used to derive revenue for the company are reliant on the collection of data to achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward we have developed a strategy to increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection one strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on a monthly basis “mau” and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations places available to see our mau’s visit over the same time period we are currently seeing approximately  unique mobile devices by the mau on a monthly basis and roughly  unique devices for the first  days of  the ability to see and collect the data required from these unique devices comes from the installation of our proprietary software development kit sdk into third party mobile applications apps to continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis we need to have our sdk installed in more third party apps we believe our unique offering to potential app partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry the task of partnering with third party apps for installation of our sdk is handled internally by our business development team   as of march   we had approximately  places in our proprietary places database and that number should increase to over  places by the end of the second quarter  thus exponentially increasing the amount of data we collect we have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies the task of growing our places database is handled by our internal technology team the company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings management intends to hire additional sales personnel in the last three quarters of  as working capital permits    agreements   due to the evolution of the mobiquity network’s business model our agreements with the mall developers are no longer considered essential to our business ope rations as our places data base has grown to approximately  million locations making malls a subset within our retail category this is the major reason why we have allowed many of our mall developer contracts to be terminated by the other parties we continue to have active agreements with preit and rousse malls on a revenue sharing basis covering an aggregate of  malls and an agreement with simon property malls covering about  malls which agreement will expire no later than december   since april  this agreement is being financed through lines of credit totaling  million which lines of credit have been assigned to us by two stockholders in exchange for our common stock see “item ” this agreement is anticipated to be in default if the lines of

ace marketing is an integrated marketing company focused on working with clients to grow their business ace marketing’s core business is to provide a wide range of quality promotional products to a wide range of corporate nonprofit and educational clients in addition ace marketing offers brand analysis and development website analysis and development database analysis and building and integrated marketing campaigns using direct mail email marketing mobile marketing promotional products and other mediums that help our clients connect with their customers and acquire new business   although the majority of ace marketing’s revenue is derived from the sale of promotional products it is through the use of our fourstep process supported by marketing technology platforms that allows us to attract and retain clients the sale of promotional products alone can be considered a commodity business so by offering our valueadded services we believe we have created a competitive advantage we believe a client will be less likely to leave if we created their logo built their website andor appended their customer database                ace marketing derives revenues from each of the following resources     ☐ brand analysis and development         ☐ website analysis and development         ☐ database analysis and building         ☐ integrated marketing solutions   substantially all of our resources and marketing efforts are dedicated toward deriving revenues from the operations of mobiquity networks    competition   we compete in the locationbased mobile data marketing and research business and in all other facets of our business against small medium and large companies throughout the united states some examples include companies such as placed placeiq factual xad and foursquare although we can give no assurance that our business will be able to compete against other companies with greater experience and resources we believe we have a competitive advantage with our proprietary places database software and technology platform as previously mentioned we have the exclusive rights to provide bluetooth marketing services in the common area for various shopping malls this gives us the ability to compete with these other companies to provide indoor data based upon the exclusive rights in such malls   with respect to our integrated marketing subsidiary while our competition in this business vertical is extensive we believe that this industry is extremely fragmented and that there are no companies that dominate the market in which we operate we compete within the industry on the basis of service competitive prices personal relationships and competitive commissions to our sales representatives to sell promotional products for us rather than our competitors competitors’ advantages over us may include better financing greater experience lower margins and better personal relationships than us    employees   we have approximately  full time employees including executive management technical personnel salespeople and support staff employees we also utilize several additional firmspersons who provide services to us on a nonexclusive basis as independent consultants                    item a risk factors   investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk before deciding to invest in our company or deciding to maintain or increase your investment you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all information in this form k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes if one or more of the following risks are realized our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment   risks relating to our business   we are dependent upon the immediate receipt of substantial additional financing to carry out our plan of operations and to meet our anticipated financial commitments over the next one year our auditors have expressed a substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern we are dependent upon the immediate receipt of substantial additional financing to carry out our plan of operations and to meet our anticipated financial commitments over the next one year including without limitation maintaining the current technology and supporting staff making minimum payments to our mall managers as required and making timely payments to our debt holders the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming our company will continue as a going concern our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional debt andor equity financing to advance our mall network system and to develop a revenue stream resulting therefrom we have incurred net losses for the years ending december    and  of   and  respectively as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  for the year ended december   we have had negative cash flows from operating activities of  these factors raise substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a going concern we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional equity andor debt financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all to remain a going concern   we have a history of operating losses and may not in the future generate consistent revenues or profits since our inception we have experienced a continued history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit of  at december   we have incurred net losses for the years ending december    and  of   and  respectively our operating losses for the past several years are primarily attributable to the transformation of our company into an advertising technology corporation our mobiquity network subsidiary has  in revenues from its operations for the year ended december   we can provide no assurances that our operations will generate consistent or predictable revenue or be profitable in the future this is particularly the case as we are shifting our business emphasis to focus on our mobiquity network business   we entered into convertible promissory notes in the aggregate amount of  which are secured by all of our assets these notes have a current maturity dates beginning on august of  but the noteholder has the right to call the note at any time which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources on march   we issued secured promissory notes in the aggregate amount of  to two nonaffiliated investors and an additional  is expected to be issued in late april  the maturity date of the notes is august through october  the payment of these notes at maturity could come at a time when it would not be advantageous to us and could materially adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources we can provide no assurances that we will be able to meet our obligations under these notes as they become due and payable   we are focusing the majority of our attention on our mobiquity networks data collection and analysis business we operate through our whollyowned subsidiaries ace marketing  promotions inc and mobiquity networks inc ace marketing is our legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers while ace marketing currently represents substantially all of our revenue we anticipate that activity from ace marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our mobiquity networks business we believe that our mobiquity networks business represents our growth opportunity going forward we expect that mobiquity networks will generate the majority of our revenue by the end of  although no assurances can be given in this regard further we can provide no assurances that the implementation of our mobiquity networks’ business will meet our expectations in terms of generating a certain amount of revenue by a certain year                    we did not receive any significant revenues from our new mobiquity business in  and we cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future revenues we may be unable to capture revenue from our new mobiquity business and product offerings in the manner in which we anticipate as such we cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future revenues   our mobiquity network business is dependent upon our successful integration of our sdk into various third party applications or apps publishers to collect and analyze data and create product offerings from the data collected for us to create and expand our business model we are dependent upon entering into agreements with mobile application third party publishers the greater the number of publisher apps into which our sdk is embedded the greater number of original data we can collect and analyze we currently have entered into agreements with a limited number of third party app publishers there is a risk that we will be unable to expand our third party publisher network on terms satisfactory to us or at all and if we are unable to do so our results of operations and overall business prospects would suffer    the locationbased mobile marketing industry is relatively new and our competition may become extensive currently we have not generated significant revenue from this new and unproven segment of our business while we intend to market our mobiquity products and services there is a risk that our locationbased mobile data collection and analysis will be unable to compete with large medium and small competitors that are in or may enter the industry with substantially larger resources and management experience    we expect to derive substantially all of our future revenues from our principal technology which leaves us subject to the risk of reliance on such technology further our principal technology is subject to pending patent applications which could be rejected by the united states patent and trademark office we expect to derive substantially all of our future revenues from mobiquity networks as such any factor adversely affecting our ability to offer and implement our solution to new customers including regulatory issues market acceptance competition performance and reliability reputation price competition and economic and market conditions would likely harm our operating results   if our mobiquity technology fails to satisfy current or future customer requirements we may be required to make significant expenditures to redesign the technology and we may have insufficient resources to do so our mobiquity networks solution is designed to address an evolving marketplace and must comply with current and evolving customer requirements in order to gain market acceptance there is a risk that we will not meet anticipated customer requirements or desires if we are required to redesign our technologies to address customer demands or otherwise modify our business model we may incur significant unanticipated expenses and losses and we may be left with insufficient resources to engage in such activities if we are unable to redesign our technology develop new technology or modify our business model to meet customer desires or any other customer requirements that may emerge our operating results would be materially and adversely affected                    if we fail to respond quickly to technological developments our service may become uncompetitive and obsolete the data collection and analysis market in which we plan to compete is expected to experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new improvements if we are unable to respond quickly to these developments we may lose competitive position and our technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete causing revenues and operating results to suffer in order to compete we may be required to develop or acquire new technology and improve our existing technology and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments we must also be able to support a range of changing customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any manner in these efforts   we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing between january  and december  we raised over  million in private equity and debt financing to support our transformation from an integrated marketing company to a technology company since we might be unable to generate recurring or predictable revenue or cash flow to fund our operations we will likely need to seek additional perhaps substantial equity or debt financing even following this offering to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations we may also need additional funding for developing products and services increasing our sales and marketing capabilities and acquiring complementary companies technologies and assets as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes we cannot predict our future capital needs with precision and we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all which could lead to termination of our business   when we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are required we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private equity offerings debt financings or other financing alternatives additional equity or debt financing may not be available on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we will be prevented from pursuing operational development and commercialization efforts and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed   if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities our stockholders will experience dilution debt financing if available would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms such as liquidation and other preferences which are not favorable to us or our stockholders if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it our business operating results financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations failure to secure additional financing on favorable terms could have severe adverse consequences to us    our future performance is materially dependent upon our management and their ability to manage our growth our future performance is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing management this is particularly the case as we seek to ramp up our newer locationbased mobile business in  and beyond the loss of the services of our management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business we currently lack “key man” life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees competition for additional qualified management is intense and we may be unable to attract and retain additional key personnel the number of management personnel is currently limited and they may be unable to manage our expansion successfully and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition                if our management team does not remain with us in the future our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected our future success depends in large part on our current senior management team and our ability to attract and retain additional highquality management and operating personnel our senior management team’s indepth knowledge of and deep relationships with the participants in our industry are extremely valuable to us our business also requires skilled technical and marketing personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry and the loss of even a few qualified employees or an inability to attract retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow to attract and retain key personnel we use various measures including an equity incentive program and incentive bonuses for executive officers and other employees these measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively we also have a number of employees who were granted stock options over the past few years that have an exercise price per share that is lower than the current fair market value if we are successful as a public company of which there can be no assurances these employees may choose to exercise their options and sell the shares recognizing a substantial gain as a result it may be difficult for us to retain such employees   if we are unable to attract additional management and sales representatives or if a significant number of our manager or sales representatives leave us our ability to increase our net revenues could be negatively impacted our ability to expand our business will depend in part on our ability to attract additional management and sales representatives competition for qualified managers and sales representatives can be intense and we may be unable to hire additional team members when we need them or at all any difficulties we experience in attracting additional managers or sales representatives could have a negative impact on our ability to expand our retailer base increase net revenues and continue our growth in addition we must retain our current management and sales representatives and properly incentivize them to obtain new relationships if a significant number of our managers and sales representatives were to leave us our net revenues could be negatively impacted in certain circumstances we have entered into agreements with our managers and sales representatives that contain noncompete provisions to mitigate this risk but we may need to litigate to enforce our rights under these agreements which could be timeconsuming expensive and ineffective a significant increase in the turnover rate among our current managers or sales representatives could also increase our recruiting costs and decrease our operating efficiency which could lead to a decline in our net revenues and profitability   our mobiquity solution contains and is dependent upon open source software which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions we use open source software in our solutions and will use open source software in the future some licenses governing our use of open source software contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners although we monitor our use of open source software we cannot assure you that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our solutions that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our solutions or that they will not do so in the future additionally the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by us or foreign courts there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or provide our solutions in addition the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such open source software to others on unfavorable license terms as a result of our current or future use of open source software we may face claims or litigation be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our solutions discontinue making our solutions available in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action any such reengineering or other remedial efforts could require significant additional research and development resources and we may not be able to successfully complete any such reengineering or other remedial efforts further in addition to risks related to license requirements use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and operating results                    we rely on information technology to operate our business and maintain competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business we depend on the use of information technologies and systems as our operations grow in size and scope we will be required to continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our infrastructure our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our systems and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our solutions in response to competitive services and product offerings the emergence of alternative platforms will require new investment in technology new developments in other areas such as cloud computing could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner   if we fail to respond quickly to technological developments our technology may become uncompetitive and obsolete the mobile data market is expected to experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly to these developments we may lose competitive position and our solutions or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete causing revenues and operating results to suffer in order to compete we may be required to develop or acquire new technologies and improve our existing technologies and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for our industry we must also be able to support a range of changing customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any manner in these efforts and our inability to do so could cause our business to suffer   our technology and associated business processes may contain undetected errors which could limit our ability to provide our services and diminish the attractiveness of our offerings our mobiquity technology may contain undetected errors defects or bugs as a result our customers or end users may discover errors or defects in our technology or the systems incorporating our technology may not operate as expected we may discover significant errors or defects in the future that we may not be able to fix our inability to fix any of those errors could limit our ability to provide our solution impair the reputation of our brand and diminish the attractiveness of our product offerings to our customers  in addition we may utilize third party technology or components in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business    because we do not manufacture the promotional products we distribute we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our promotional products our ace marketing subsidiary obtains all of our promotional products from thirdparty suppliers both domestically and overseas primarily in china we submit purchase orders to our suppliers who are not committed to supply products to us therefore suppliers may be unable to provide the products we need in the quantities we request  because we lack control of the actual production of the promotional products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely cost effective basis there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock                    changes in consumer sentiment or laws rules or regulations regarding tracking technologies and other privacy matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate net revenues and could adversely affect our ability to collect data on consumer shopping behavior the collection and use of electronic information about user is an important element of our mobiquity technology and solutions however consumers may become increasingly resistant to the collection use and sharing of information including information used to deliver advertising and to attribute credit to publishers in performance marketing programs and take steps to prevent such collection use and sharing of information for example consumer complaints andor lawsuits regarding advertising or other tracking technologies in general and our practices specifically could adversely impact our business in addition to this change in consumer preferences if retailers or brands perceive significant negative consumer reaction to targeted advertising or the tracking of consumers’ activities they may determine that such advertising or tracking has the potential to negatively impact their brand in that case advertisers may limit or stop the use of our solutions and our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected    our business practices with respect to data and consumer protection could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental

liabilities for us cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations from time to time we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business our failure to anticipate the application of these laws and regulations accurately or other failure to comply could create

or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business in particular in the event that we are restricted in whole or in part from operating in one or more countries our ability to retain or increase our customer base may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain or grow our net revenues as anticipated    there may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company proper systems of internal controls over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company we have a limited accounting and finance staff and such staff has relatively limited experience in operating the accounting function of a growing public company as such we may be unable to effectively establish implement and update our internal control systems this would leave us without the ability to reliably assimilate and compile financial information about our company and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud all of which would have a negative impact on our company from many perspectives                    moreover we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting even if properly in place will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially and adversely affect our business reputation stock price and results

the redemption of the shares together with a premium prior to the redemption of our common shares in addition our board of directors could authorize the issuance of new series of preferred stock that is convertible into our common shares which could decrease the relative voting power of our common shares or result in dilution to our existing shareholders     research analysts do not currently publish research about our business limiting information available to shareholders and if this continues to be the case or if analysts do publish unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common shares it could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume the trading market for our common shares will depend in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business and industry the price of our common shares could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common shares could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline   as a public company we are subject to complex legal and accounting requirements that will require us to incur significant expenses and will expose us to risk of noncompliance as a public company we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies the cost of compliance with many of these requirements is material not only in absolute terms but more importantly in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company our management team is relatively inexperienced in complying with these requirements which may lead to errors in our accounting and financial statements and which may impair our operations this inexperience may also increase the cost of compliance and may also increase the risk that we will fail to comply failure to comply with these requirements can have numerous adverse consequences including but not limited to our inability to file required periodic reports on a timely basis loss of market confidence andor governmental or private actions against us we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial competitive disadvantage visàvis our privately held and larger public competitors   we may be subject to shareholder litigation thereby diverting our resources that may have a material effect on our profitability and results of operations the market for our common shares may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future  in the past plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities  we may become the target of similar litigation securities litigation will result in substantial costs and liabilities and will divert management’s attention and resources     compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act and sec regulations have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities                our common stock may be considered “penny stock” and may be difficult to trade  the sec has adopted regulations that generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market or exercise price of less than  per share subject to specific exemptions  the market price of our common stock may be less than  per share and therefore may be designated as a “penny stock” according to sec rules unless our common shares are trading on a national exchange this designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities these rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their common shares   item b

or other financing and our ability to generate cash from operations are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking in nature and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the companys actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results   overview   mobiquity technologies inc a new york corporation the “company” is the parent company of two operating subsidiaries mobiquity networks inc“mobiquity networks” and ace marketing  promotions inc “ace marketing” the company’s whollyowned subsidiary mobiquity networks has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising technology company focused on driving awareness and foottraffic throughout its indoor mallbased beacon network into a next generation mobile location data and marketing company mobiquity networks provides precise unique atscale locationbased data and insights on consumer’s real world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research with our combined data sets of shopping malls premium outlets and cinemas beacon data and first party location data via our advanced software development kit “sdk” utilizing multiple geolocation technologies mobiquity networks provides one of the most accurate and scaled solution for mobile data collection and analysis mobiquity networks is seeking to create several new revenue streams from the mobile data collection and analysis including but not limited to push notification campaigns mobile audiences  segments realtime data provision attribution reporting and custom research the company is also attempting to reduce expenses by renegotiating certain mall developer agreements   ace marketing is our legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers while ace marketing currently represents substantially all of our revenue we anticipate that activity from ace marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our mobiquity networks business we believe that our mobiquity networks business represents our greatest growth opportunity going forward   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements                revenue recognition  ace marketing’s revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in general title passes to our customers upon shipment of the merchandise revenue is recognized on a gross basis since ace marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership latitude in selection of vendors and pricing and bears all credit risk advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits ace marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold when incurred additional source of revenue derived from emailstexts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided   revenue recognition – mobiquity networks revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale the customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign which are normally in short duration periods the second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data revenue from data can occur in two ways the first is a direct feed which is billed at the end of each month the second way is through the purchasing of audience segments when an audience segment is purchased we bill the buyer upon delivery which is usually  days for the order date    allowance for doubtful accounts  we are required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations as to the realizability of our accounts receivable we make these assessments based on the following factors a historical experience b customer concentrations customer credit worthiness d current economic conditions and e changes in customer payment terms   accounting for stock based compensation  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the company uses the blacksholes optionpricing model to determine fair value of the awards which involves certain subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term “volatility” and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stockbased compensation and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations     plan of operation   mobiquity networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above all of the products used to derive revenue for the company are reliant on the collection of data to achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward we have developed a strategy to increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection one strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on a monthly basis “mau” and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations places available to see our mau’s visit over the same time period we are currently seeing approximately  unique mobile devices by the mau on a monthly basis and roughly  unique devices for the first  days of  the ability to see and collect the data required from these unique devices comes from the installation of our proprietary software development kit sdk into third party mobile applications apps to continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis we need to have our sdk installed in more third party apps we believe our unique offering to potential app partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry the task of partnering with third party apps for installation of our sdk is handled internally by our business development team   as of march   we had approximately  places in our proprietary places database and that number should increase to over  places by the end of the second quarter  thus exponentially increasing the amount of data we collect we have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies the task of growing our places database is handled by our internal technology team the company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings management intends to hire additional sales personnel in the last three quarters of  as working capital permits

marketing  promotions inc “the company” or “mobiquity” we operate through two whollyowned us subsidiaries namely mobiquity networks inc and ace marketing  promotions inc mobiquity networks owns  of mobiquity wireless slu a company incorporated in spain this corporation had an office in spain to support our us operations which office was closed in the fourth quarter of    we operate a national locationbased mobile advertising network that has developed a consumerfocused proximity network which we believe is unlike any other in the united states our integrated suite of proprietary location based mobile advertising technologies allows clients to execute more personalized and contextually relevant experiences driving brand awareness and incremental revenue   mobiquity technologies inc a new york corporation otcqb mobq through its whollyowned subsidiary mobiquity networks inc has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising technology company focused on driving awareness and foottraffic throughout its indoor mallbased beacon network into a next generation mobile location data and marketing company the company provides precise unique atscale location based data and

attribution reporting and custom research   ace marketing is our legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers while ace marketing currently represents substantially all of our revenue we anticipate that activity from ace marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our mobiquity networks business   going concern  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern the companys continued existence is dependent upon the companys ability to obtain additional debt andor equity financing to advance its new technology revenue stream the company has incurred losses for the years ending december   and december   of  and  respectively as of december   the company has an accumulated deficit of  the company has had negative cash flows from operating activities of  and  for the years ending december   and  respectively these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern   management has plans to address the company’s financial situation as follows   in the near term management plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the company’s business plan related to the bluetoothenabled ibeacon compatible technology management will continue to seek out equity andor debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the company’s financial obligations there is no assurance however that lenders and investors will continue to advance capital to the company or that the new business operations will be profitable the possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential inability to achieve profitability raises doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   in the long term management believes that the company’s projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the company that will be used to finance the company’s future growth however there can be no assurances that the company’s efforts to raise equity and debt at acceptable terms or that the planned activities will be successful or that the company will ultimately attain profitability the company’s longterm viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt or equity funding to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations and the ability of the company to achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations         f        principles of consolidation  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mobiquity technologies inc formerly known as ace marketing  promotions inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries mobiquity networks inc ace marketing inc which has had its name changed to ace marketing  promotions inc and mobiquity wireless slu all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments  effective january   the company adopted fasb asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” “asc ” for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis asc  establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements the adoption of asc  did not have an impact on the company’s financial position or operating results but did expand certain disclosures   asc  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date additionally asc  requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs these inputs are prioritized below   level  observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level  unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions   cash and cash equivalents include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of december   and  these securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as level  within our fair value hierarchy   the carrying amounts of financial instruments including accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities and promissory note approximated fair value as of december   and  because of the relatively shortterm maturity of these instruments and their market interest rates no instruments are carried at fair value         f        the company accounts for its derivative liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis under level          level      level      level      total     fair value of derivatives      –            –                                                 embedded conversion features   the company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under asc  derivatives and hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion features should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings if the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under asc  the instrument is evaluated under asc  debt with conversion and other options for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature   derivative financial instruments   the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow market or foreign currency risks the company evaluates all of its’ financial instruments including stock purchase warrants and options to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income   cash and cash equivalents  the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less as well as bank money market accounts to be cash equivalents as of december   and  the balances are  and  respectively   concentration of credit risk  financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents   concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the company’s customer base and their dispersion across geographic areas principally within the united states the company routinely addresses the financial strength of its customers and as a consequence believes that its receivable credit risk exposure is limited   the company places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions at times the company maintains bank account balances which exceed fdic limits as of december   and  the company exceeded fdic limits by  and  respectively     revenue recognition – the company recognizes revenue for all revenue streams when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with asc  “ revenue recognition ” the company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met     · persuasive evidence for an agreement exists     · service has been provided or shipment has occurred     · the fee is fixed or determinable and     · collection is reasonably assured    ace marketing – ace marketing’s revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in general title passes to our customers upon the company’s shipment of the merchandise revenue is recognized on a gross basis since ace marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership latitude in selection of vendors and pricing and bears all credit risk advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits ace marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold when incurred additional source of revenue derived from emailstexts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided         f        mobiquity networks – revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale the customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign which are normally in short duration periods the second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data revenue from data can occur in two ways the first is a direct feed which is billed at the end of each month the second way is through the purchasing of audience segments when an audience segment is purchased we bill the buyer upon delivery which is usually  days for the order date   allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   and  allowance for doubtful accounts were  and  respectively   inventory – inventory is recorded at cost first in first out and is comprised of finished goods the company maintains an inventory on hand for its largest customer’s frequent order items all items held are branded for the customer therefore are not available for public distribution the company has an agreement with this customer for cost recovery if vendor relationship is terminated there have been minimal reserves placed on inventory based on this arrangement as of december   and  the company has reserved against  and  respectively   property and equipment  property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation is expensed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets leasehold improvements are being amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the remaining term of the lease the costs of additions and improvements which substantially extend the useful life of a particular asset are capitalized repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account and the gain or loss on disposition is reflected in operating income   long lived assets  longlived assets such as property equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset the fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows market value of similar assets if available or independent appraisals if required if the carrying amount of the longlived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset when fair values are not available the company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets the company recognized  impairment losses for the period ended december      patents and trademarks  patents and trademarks developed during the prior years were capitalized for the period of development and testing expenditures during the planning stage and after implementation have been expensed in accordance with asc   advertising costs  advertising costs are expensed as incurred for the years ended december   and  there were advertising costs of  and  respectively   accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the company uses the blacksholes optionpricing model to determine fair value of the awards which involves certain subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term “volatility” and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stockbased compensation and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations refer to note  “stock option plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for a more detailed discussion         f        beneficial conversion features  debt instruments that contain a beneficial conversion feature are recorded as deemed interest to the holders of the convertible debt instruments the beneficial conversion is calculated as the difference between the fair values of the underlying common stock less the proceeds that have been received for the debt instrument limited to the value received   foreign currency translations  the company’s functional and reporting currency is the us dollar we own a subsidiary in europe our subsidiary’s functional currency is the euro all transactions initiated in euros are translated into us dollars in accordance with asc  “translation of financial statements” as follows     i monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date   ii fixed assets and equity transactions at historical rates   iii revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period   adjustments arising from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss therefore translation adjustments are not included in determining net income loss but reported as other comprehensive income   no significant realized exchange gains or losses were recorded since march   date of acquisition of subsidiary to december     income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities for which income tax or tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   net loss per share  basic net loss per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding diluted earnings per share reflect in periods in which they have a dilutive effect the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options the number of common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise of certain options and warrants that were excluded from the diluted

pronouncements  we have reviewed the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods the company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or operations in the near term the applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and
