raptor flight control system the most important uas technology and most difficult to master is the vehicle autopilot and the operator interface the ground control station drone aviation’s raptor flight control system comprises the georgia institute of technology’s gust autopilot and the dac developed gcs autopilot the raptor onboard autopilot gust executes on standard intel i i i single board computing architecture raptor is not performance constrained as are many flight control systems operating on proprietary difficult to upgrade hardware being able to rapidly increase computing power allows for mission expansion using capabilities such as gpsdenied vision navigation target recognition and neural network vehicle control commercially licensed exclusively to dac gust is an extensible software platform for full vehicle and environment simulation onboard dynamic vehicle flight control autopilot and sensorfusion navigation gust is mature technology with  years of research and operational experience and continues to be improved and expanded by georgia tech and drone aviation ground control station gcs the raptor gcs is unique in the industry developed by dac for use in tethered systems the gcs is uncluttered by removing confusing settings and options vehicle tuning and informational windows not required for tethered systems further the raptor gcs operating system is separate from the operator’s tablet pc phone or other display and input device this abstraction layer allows the vehicle to be monitored by a central site and operated with many different types of devices locally over a secure wifi or wired ethernetfiber optic link kevlar armored tether the dac tether system is an armored smart leash that provides uninterruptible power and unhackable communications to the watt uas and wasp aerostat while this concept appears simple dac’s proprietary tether technology is a key differentiator and enabler for longduration safe unmanned flight advantages tetherbased systems for aerial platforms deliver a number of advantages fly more reliably and safely than freeflying unmanned aircraft unlimited flight duration from groundbased power transmit power video and other data vehicle control securely through kevlar armored tether no signal to hack tension control winch system a critical part of the watt ground support equipment the tension control winch maintains consistent tether alignment with the watt aerial vehicle as the vehicle ascends or descends the winch system rapidly adjusts when in loiter or mobility modes the tension control monitoring and adjustment system measures tether line tension hundreds of times per second read more small adjustments are made to ensure the tether does not become slack or pull on the aerial vehicle the system is fully automatic compensating for both drone operation and environmental conditions managed tension avoids slack or whipping of the tether in winds or vehicle flight changes which can result in the tether wrapping around nearby obstructions further the vehicle is more stable when the tether tension is actively managed as the tether is not inconsistently pulling on the vehicle advantages more stable vehicle flight resulting in better video and higher accuracy stationkeeping safer operation especially in windy conditions or mobile operations winch is designed to allow safe recovery of aerial vehicle accessible mobile reliable about drone aviation was formed in april  from the acquisition of lighter than air systems corp ltas founded in  the development of

growth jacksonville flmarketwired  november    drone aviation holding corp otcqx drne drone aviation the company or dac a manufacturer of tethered drones and lighterthanair aerostats today provided the following business update from chairman and ceo jay nussbaum to all of drone aviations stakeholders since i became chairman and ceo of drone aviation the company has dedicated significant resources to the development and implementation of a strategic plan based on three fundamental ideas dacs proprietary technology will be a significant differentiator in the market dacs products will address demand in the rapidly growing worldwide market for drone technology and dacs organization will be led by a talented and experienced management team after completing three quarters of the year i would like to provide you with a business update highlighting some of the results of the efforts to move drone aviation from primarily a product development focus towards a commercialization and revenue generation focus during  drone aviation has made great progress in solidifying its competitive advantages based on its proprietary tethered drone technology as a key differentiator and in building out its aerial product platforms including the wasp the watt and the recently introduced bolt coaxial tethered helicopter while still relatively early in our commercialization transition it is clear that our teams hard work is beginning to pay off for example so far this year we have received six us department of defense dod awards increasing our current order backlog last month for our watt and wasp tethered products earlier this year we unveiled bolt at the ads warrior expo east and we expect to continue to work closely with ads our valuable sales and distribution partner to commercialize all of our products dac also intends to continue to work closely with our expanding network of partners to build our pipeline of prospective customers we are especially proud of our numerous engineering accomplishments following multiple dod awards to upgrade our wasp product line to further expand its capabilities as a tactical mobile aerostat i would like to comment briefly on some other notable developments this year during the first nine months of  the company generated  in revenue an increase of  or  from  in revenue reported in the same period in  while we are pleased with this growth it is important to note that our newest awards from the dod including the first sale of our watt electric tethered drone as well as the third in a series of wasp tactical aerostat integration awards will be delivered in future quarters we believe both of these dod awards reflect early validation of the benefits and value of the companys tethered drone technology and importantly will contribute to our growing backlog which we expect to convert into revenue during the fourth quarter of  and the first half of  we received a patent covering various elements of dacs intellectual property including the tethering system which is a major boost to our intellectual property portfolio we intend to continue to collaborate and work closely with the talented engineering teams and faculty at georgia tech research corporation on exclusively licensed technology or brains of the drone incorporating stateoftheart artificial intelligence and visionbased navigation systems that enable drone operations without the need to exclusively rely on gps signals anticipating entire industries and key vertical markets adopting drone technologies drone aviation is working on solutions designed to extend beyond the drone hardware itself we are engaging with partners ideally suited to add our tethered drones to their emerging big data analytics applications we expect these applications to greatly benefit from our advanced sensor payloads ability to capture and relay critical realtime data and information something we believe is increasingly valuable to enterprises civilian agencies such as law enforcement and the military in august  the faas landmark set of guidelines for commercial drone use entitled small unmanned aircraft regulations part  went into effect at that time we noted that the new rules were expected to have a positive impact for state entities exploring how to deploy drones to support first responders as well as commercial entities seeking to expand security for large public venues and commercial facilities this proved to be correct because interest in our mobile tethered drone technology has increased based on the ability of our tethered products to operate in full compliance with the new commercial drone regulations because of my confidence in drone aviation dr phil frost the chairman of our strategic advisory board and i purchased  in aggregate in convertible promissory notes in the companys private offering that closed in september of this year these additional funds are already assisting the company in meeting the growing interest in its tethered products from current and potential military and commercial customers dac is investing these resources intending to increase both sales and manufacturing including building up inventory of critical longlead time system components i would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in drone aviation as we strive to implement our strategic plans and create value

articledrone aviation holding corp provides business updatemarketwirednovember  reblogsharetweetsharejacksonville flmarketwired  november    drone aviation holding corp drne drone aviation the company or dac a manufacturer of tethered drones and lighterthanair aerostats today provided the following business update from chairman and ceo jay nussbaumto all of drone aviations stakeholderssince i became chairman and ceo of drone aviation the company has dedicated significant resources to the development and implementation of a strategic plan based on three fundamental ideas dacs proprietary technology will be a significant differentiator in the market dacs products will address demand in the rapidly growing worldwide market for drone technology and dacs organization will be led by a talented and experienced management team after completing three quarters of the year i would like to provide you with a business update highlighting some of the results of the efforts to move drone aviation from primarily a product development focus towards a commercialization and revenue generation focusduring  drone aviation has made great progress in solidifying its competitive advantages based on its proprietary tethered drone technology as a key differentiator and in building out its aerial product platforms including the wasp the watt and the recently introduced bolt coaxial tethered helicopter while still relatively early in our commercialization transition it is clear that our teams hard work is beginning to pay off for example so far this year we have received six us department of defense dod awards increasing our current order backlog last month for our watt and wasp tethered products earlier this year we unveiled bolt at the ads warrior expo east and we expect to continue to work closely with ads our valuable sales and distribution partner to commercialize all of our products dac also intends to continue to work closely with our expanding network of partners to build our pipeline of prospective customers we are especially proud of our numerous engineering accomplishments following multiple dod awards to upgrade our wasp product line to further expand its capabilities as a tactical mobile aerostati would like to comment briefly on some other notable developments this yearduring the first nine months of  the company generated  in revenue an increase of  or  from  in revenue reported in the same period in  while we are pleased with this growth it is important to note that our newest awards from the dod including the first sale of our watt electric tethered drone as well as the third in a series of wasp tactical aerostat integration awards will be delivered in future quarters we believe both of these dod awards reflect early validation of the benefits and value of the companys tethered drone technology and importantly will contribute to our growing backlog which we expect to convert into revenue during the fourth quarter of  and the first half of we received a patent covering various elements of dacs intellectual property including the tethering system which is a major boost to our intellectual property portfolio we intend to continue to collaborate and work closely with the talented engineering teams and faculty at georgia tech research corporation on exclusively licensed technology or brains of the drone incorporating stateoftheart artificial intelligence and visionbased navigation systems that enable drone operations without the need to exclusively rely on gps signalsanticipating entire industries and key vertical markets adopting drone technologies drone aviation is working on solutions designed to extend beyond the drone hardware itself we are engaging with partners ideally suited to add our tethered drones to their emerging big data analytics applications we expect these applications to greatly benefit from our advanced sensor payloads ability to capture and relay critical realtime data and information something we believe is increasingly valuable to enterprises civilian agencies such as law enforcement and the militaryin august  the faas landmark set of guidelines for commercial drone use entitled small unmanned aircraft regulations part  went into effect at that time we noted that the new rules were expected to have a positive impact for state entities exploring how to deploy drones to support first responders as well as commercial entities seeking to expand security for large public venues and commercial facilities this proved to be correct because interest in our mobile tethered drone technology has increased based on the ability of our tethered products to operate in full compliance with the new commercial drone regulationsbecause of my confidence in drone aviation dr phil frost the chairman of our strategic advisory board and i purchased  in aggregate in convertible promissory notes in the companys private offering that closed in september of this year these additional funds are already assisting the company in meeting the growing interest in its tethered products from current and potential military and commercial customers dac is investing these resources intending to
