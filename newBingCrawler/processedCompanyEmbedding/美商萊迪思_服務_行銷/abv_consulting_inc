relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended march   the discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ significantly from the results expectations and plans discussed in these forwardlooking statements see cautionary statement on forwardlooking information business overview abv consulting inc is in the business of providing merchandising and consulting services to craft beer brewers and distributors as well as providing additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations as needed while we do not directly produce alcoholic beverages we provide services to help businesses in the industry improve their marketing sales and operations the company was founded by andrew gavrin a seasoned businessman who has worked in the alcoholic beverage field for the past  years after working as a strategy consultant for consumer product and other companies mr gavrin recognized the opportunity for a robust independent third party company that could help craft brewers and distributors create and implement marketing promotional and merchandising plans while working in the industry following  years as a strategy consultant in march  we entered into an agreement with one of the countrys oldest craft brewers to assist in the brewerys marketing strategy our efforts during the first quarter of  were primarily focused on securing this engagement and once signed providing exceptional work for our client in order to ensure continuing engagements with the client and referrals to other craft brewers in addition we have focused our efforts on social media engagement we now have almost  twitter followers and almost 7 facebook fans through social media we are continuing to push our message that we are in perfect position to provide marketing support to the growing craft beer industry we are showcasing our expertise in the industry by highlighting and providing input on key industry issues offering marketing and sales support ideas and networking with key opinion makers in the first quarter of  we have also maintained our relationship with a startup cidery in philadelphia which is expected to commence operations in the back half of  we have held discussions regarding supporting a large festival in the third quarter of  and have continued to hold discussions with breweries and retailers across the country in may  we will be attending the national craft brewers conference in philadelphia with the hope of building relationships with additional craft breweries we will continue delivering for our client under our engagement will look to expand this relationship and use this as a reference for additional clients and will continue our aggressive social media campaign despite our efforts to implement our business plan we have not generated any revenue since inception as a result we consider acquiring a business which is either a company that has recently commenced its operations and is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital or is seeking to expand into new markets alternatively a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in an initial public offering critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates in financial statements the presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates during the period covered by these financial statements include the valuation of deferred tax asset and imputed compensation costs emerging growth company we are not currently required to comply with the sec rules that implement sections  and  of the sarbanesoxley act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose upon becoming a public company we will be required to comply with certain of these rules which will require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting though we will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  until the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years although if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 7 million as of any june  before that time we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following december  or if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a threeyear period we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company at such time our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating fair value measurements and fair value of financial instruments the company adopted asc topic  fair value measurements asc topic  clarifies the definition of fair value prescribes methods for measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data level inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information the company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with asc topic  due to the shortterm nature of all financial assets and liabilities their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet date revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with fasb asc no  revenue recognition in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured the company recognized revenues from two primary sources  consulting services the marketing and pro bono efforts actively taken by the company to date have been with the goal of securing clients who will be paying the company to perform consulting services for them these clients are expected to be brewers distributors and retailers a the company is actively promoting its ability to assist potential clients in a range of services in their marketing promotion merchandising and sales efforts these can include everything from developing a brand from scratch to creating a cohesive marketing strategy to developing a oneoff promotion or merchandising concept for a client to executing a series of samplings or promotions b the revenue generated will be dependent on the type of work performed for a larger strategy project the company anticipates charging a client by the hour whereas for a oneoff promotion a set price will likely be the pricing structure to provide staffing for implementation of an idea the company expects a per event cost structure  proprietary events based on the success of the charitable beer festival which the company developed managed and executed early in  we believe that there is an opportunity to create proprietary events which could generate revenue for the company the company would manage all of the aspects of the event  from the theme to the logistics to the marketing to the staffing and execution and in turn would receive all of the revenue from such events in addition to the two primary sources of expected revenue outlined above the company believes that there will be additional sources though currently unplanned for opportunities for revenue these could include online advertising revenue from other companies looking to attract a similar customer base providing training on craft beer to the general public and licensing custom merchandising pieces for breweries as well as other opportunities that are yet unforeseen in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  on presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic   disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern currently there is no guidance in us gaap about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures the amendments in this update provide that guidance in doing so the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the amendments require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the amendments  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans the amendments in this update are effective for public entities for annual periods ending after december   early adoption is permitted the effect of adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by fasb that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption results of operations for the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   we have conducted minimal operations during the three months ended march   and we have not generated revenues during this period we had net losses from operating of  for the three months ended march   as compared to 7 for the three months ended march   during the three months ended march   we experienced general and administrative expenses of  and professional fees of  for total expenses of  these expenses consist of professional fees for legal and accounting fees for the three months ended march   we experienced general and administrative expenses of  and professional fees of 7 for total expenses of 7 liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis we have been funding our operations through the sale of our common stock our primary uses of cash have been for legal accounting and audit fees the following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity in the near term  development of a company website  exploration of potential marketing and advertising opportunities and  the cost of being a public company our net revenues are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses at march   we had a cash balance of   since inception we raised  from the sale of common stock and  in notes from our president and ceo to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures we may be required to raise additional funds particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions that our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing for up to  months other than working capital we presently have no other alternative source of working capital we may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations we may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we do not anticipate we will be profitable in  therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities obtaining credit facilities or other financing mechanisms however the trading price of our common stock and a downturn in the us equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing furthermore if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock the inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations if we are unable to obtain additional financing we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations we anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future therefore our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly going concern as of march   the company had an accumulated deficit of  and used cash in operations of  for the three month ended march   losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for professional fees and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations we do not have any contractual obligations at this time may   c

the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will go to the selling security holders as described below in the sections we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders the primary source of competition will come from the manufacturers and distributors directly those that have the resources and inclination to handle these tasks inhouse will not need our services developing and executing such promotions and other marketing techniques is typically one of their responsibilities however because many do not have the time money or people to do so they use outside companies such as · large national and local marketing agencies such as digitas httpdigitascom interpublic httpintercomagency and omnicom httpomnicomgroupcom · alcoholic beverage sampling companies such as hauspromotions httphauspromotionscom and cea httpclassieentertainmentagencycom · local merchandising companies the large marketing agencies do not have an expertise in craft beer and are often too expensive for much of our target market to engage while the sampling companies do have expertise in the alcoholic beverage industry they are geared primarily towards the mass brewers  anheuser busch miller coors crown imports and heineken  and other imagedriven wine and spirits companies as a result they do not generally have expertise in the education needed to effectively promote craft beers local merchandising companies are too small to identify and are not widely spread throughout all of the major markets in between these competitors there is a niche area that we plan to fill company description we were incorporated on october   under the laws of the state of nevada we are in the business of providing merchandising and consulting services to craft beer brewers and distributors as well as providing additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations as needed while we do not directly produce alcoholic beverages we provide services to help businesses in the industry improve their marketing sales and operations our business activities thus far have been concentrated in and around the philadelphia pennsylvania market the company was founded by andrew gavrin a seasoned businessman who has worked in the alcoholic beverage field for the past  years after working as a strategy consultant for consumer product and other companies mr gavrin recognized the need for an independent third party company that could help craft brewers and distributors create and implement marketing promotional and merchandising plans while working in the industry following  years as a strategy consultant his experience of developing strategies and watching a sales force and distributor implement them with limited success due to competing priorities led him to launch the company mr gavrin began working on our business model in the summer of  and formed the company in october  alcoholic beverages are sold in the onpremise class of trade bars restaurants taverns and similar businesses where drinkers consume the alcohol immediately at the location and the offpremise class of trade grocery stores convenience stores liquor stores package stores and other retail locations where drinkers purchase their alcohol to consume later outside of the property of the store the threetier alcohol beverage system in the united states mandates that  with some minor exceptions  alcohol beverage manufacturers such as breweries and wineries must sell their product through a distributor who in turn sells it to the retailer manufacturers and distributors together market the brand in order to sell it to consumers both tiers manufacturers and distributors have sales forces that have numerous priorities that include executing promotions for the brand in the onpremise class of trade holding sampling events where legal in both onpremise and offpremise locations and building displays of the product in the offpremise class of trade due to limited resources and competing priorities these sales forces are not as effective as they can be and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could assist in developing and executing these strategies based on the experience of mr gavrin who developed such strategies and the implementation plan for the countrys largest craft brewer we will develop and execute the following marketing techniques for alcohol beverage manufacturers and distributors · providing general branding support including marketing research naming and graphic design help · building and merchandising displays of product in the offpremise class of trade · executing sampling promotions where legal in the onpremise and offpremise class of trade ·
