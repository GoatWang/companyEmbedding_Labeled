achieving higher performance at lower costs organizations transfer their key business processes to third parties to reduce costs improve process quality handle increased transaction volumes and reduce redundancy thirdparty bpo can enable organizations to enhance profitability and increase efficiency and reliability permitting them to concentrate on their core areas of competence bpo is a longterm strategic commitment for companies that once implemented is generally not subject to cyclical spending or information technology budget reductions increased global demand cost improvements in international communications and the automation of many business services have created a significant opportunity for offshore bpo providers and many companies are moving select office processes to providers with the capacity to perform these functions from overseas locations companies have historically used bpo providers to drive revenue growth by expanding service offerings that otherwise would be too costly to administer or by enhancing receivable collections that would otherwise not be costefficient to pursue using internal staff we believe the demand for bpo services will be primarily led by    table of contents industries that are transactiondriven and that require significant customer interactions the high cost of servicing a large number of small customer accounts makes outsourcing a compelling strategic alternative for such industries companies are increasingly looking to providers of analytics services to apply statistical tools models and techniques to clean organize and examine structured and unstructured corporate data and thereby to generate specific businessrelated analysis and insight into their business and prospects using this data the enhanced generation of business data across multiple formats substantial reduction in data storage costs growing enterprise demand for datadriven and realtime decision making and availability of sophisticated analytics tools have enabled companies to overcome a local shortage of specialized analytics talent and benefit from global labor markets service providers who can develop industryspecific analytics expertise are especially well poised to benefit from this global trend according to nasscom indias national association of software and service companies an industry trade organization exports from india in the information technology and business process management industry are expected to grow between  and  yearoveryear in the fiscal year ending march   to between  billion and  billion trend toward offshore delivery of bpo and analytics services global demand for high quality lowercost bpo services from external providers combined with operational and cost improvements in international telecommunications and the automation of many business services have created a significant opportunity for bpo service providers that are able to take advantage of an offshore talent pool many companies are moving selected front middle and backoffice processes to providers with the capacity to perform these functions from overseas locations over the past decade india and the philippines have emerged as preferred locations for companies planning to outsource services ranging from insurance claims processing payroll processing medical transcription customer relationship management to backoffice operations such as accounting and data processing filtering and organization india currently accounts for the largest share of the offshore bpo services market recently in order to take advantage of multiple language capabilities and large educated talent pools at competitive costs companies have engaged service providers with operations in other locations such as eastern europe and latin america in analytics services india has also emerged as a leading delivery location driven by a large quantitativelytrained workforce and attractive cost efficiencies as compared to other locations by  the indian offshore data analytics market is expected to be approximately  billion in size having grown at a cagr of  since  according to avendus capital private limited an indian

development teams identify prospective clients based on selective criteria that apply our industry expertise to the prospective clients business units and services goals and operating constraints and qualify the longterm relationship potential with the client our client relationships vary from a single discrete process to multiple complex integrated processes    table of contents our client management team is responsible for managing client relationships understanding client needs and developing customized services that create value for clients from our suite of outsourcing and transformation services each strategic client relationship is assigned a team that consists of members from the client management team an operations delivery leader a member of our transformation services group and a member of our technology team members of the client management team work closely with the delivery team to ensure high levels of client satisfaction and are also responsible for

diligence on processes to be outsourced to us as of december   we employed approximately  sales marketing business development and client management professionals the majority of which are based in either the us or europe each professional has significant experience in global outsourcing and expertise in identifying outsourcing opportunities and process migration our sales client management marketing and business development teams work actively with our service delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the clients final decision to either select or expand a service provider relationship the client executive or sales executive works with the service delivery team to define the scope services assumptions and execution strategies for each proposed project and to develop project estimates pricing and sales proposals our senior management reviews and approves each proposal the selling cycle varies depending on the type of service required generally ranging from six months to eighteen months for our outsourcing services members of our sales client management marketing and business development teams remain actively involved in a project through the execution phase each client team consists of a corporate sponsor executive steering committee operations leadership team and in some cases a dedicated human resources technology and infrastructure team clients we generated revenues from approximately  clients in  our top three five and ten clients respectively generated   and  of our revenues in  in  our top three five and ten clients respectively generated   and  of our total revenues while we are developing relationships with new clients and expect to continue to diversify our client base we believe that the loss of any of our ten largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance see item a risk factorsrisks related to our businesswe have a limited number of clients and provide services to few industries in  approximately  of our total revenues came from top ten clients our longterm relationships with our clients typically evolve from providing a single discrete process into providing a series of complex integrated processes across multiple business lines for outsourcing services we enter into longterm agreements with our clients with typical initial terms of between three and eight years agreements for transformation services generally have shorter initial terms each agreement is individually negotiated with the client in addition our agreements generally limit our liability to our clients to a maximum amount subject in many cases to certain exceptions such as indemnification for thirdparty claims and breaches of confidentiality in order to meet the specific needs of our clients we enter into contracts with varying contractual provisions competition competition in the bpo services industry is intense and growing see item a risk factorsrisks related to our businesswe face significant competition from usbased and nonusbased outsourcing and    table of contents information technology it companies and from our clients who may perform outsourcing services themselves either inhouse in the us or through offshore groups or other arrangements many companies including certain of our clients choose to perform some or all of their customer service collections and backoffice processes internally their employees provide these services as part of their regular business operations some companies have moved portions of their inhouse customer management functions offshore including to offshore affiliates we believe our key advantage over inhouse business processes is that we give companies the opportunity to focus on their core products and services while we focus on service delivery and operational excellence we believe that clients who operate a hybrid business modelpartnering with external bpo providers while handling other bpo functions inhousehave the opportunity to benchmark the performance of their internal bpo operations against ours we compete primarily against        bpo service companies based in offshore locations particularly india such as genpact limited and wns holdings limited        the bpo divisions of large it service companies and global bpo services companies such as accenture cognizant technology solutions tata consultancy services and infosys        niche providers that provide services in a specific geographic market industry or service area such as analytics and healthcare and        leading accounting and management consulting firms we compete against these entities by establishing ourselves as a service provider with deep industry expertise superior operational capabilities and process expertise

connection with the services we provide we provide our employees with training for applicable laws and regulations we benefit from tax relief provided by laws and regulations in india and the philippines regulation of our business by the indian government affects us in several ways for instance until april  we benefited from certain tax incentives promulgated by the indian government including a holiday from indian corporate income taxes for the operations of some of our indian operations centers during the last five years we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the special economic zones act  the special economic zones act the special economic zones act introduced a year tax holiday scheme for operations established in

industries in  approximately  of our total revenues came from top ten clients we have derived and believe that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from a limited number of large clients in  our ten largest clients accounted for approximately  of our total revenues we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients in the near future the loss of or financial difficulties at any of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows moreover the loss of a major customer could also impact our reputation in the market making it more difficult to attract and retain customers more generally on november   we received a notice of termination the termination notice from the travelers indemnity company travelers under a professional services agreement dated as of march   between us and travelers as amended from time to time the services agreement travelers represented  of our total revenues for the year ended december   while this termination did not have a material impact on our calendar year  revenues we do estimate a reduction in  revenues of between  million and  million due to certain services we currently provide to travelers being transitioned away from us throughout  in addition we expect that we will reimburse travelers for certain of their expenses incurred in connection with the termination which will further reduce our revenues in  we also expect that we will provide certain disentanglement services to travelers at our expense for up to eighteen months from the date of the termination notice the transition period which will increase our expenses in  we are still discussing the termination process with travelers and as a result at this point cannot reasonably estimate the total amount of reimbursements we may make to travelers or what internal costs we will incur as a result of the termination if the disentanglement between us and travelers is not completed in a manner that is satisfactory to both parties it could further increase our expenses and revenue loss due to the termination thereby negatively impacting our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve the global economic downturn that began in  had an adverse impact on the companies in the industries to which we provide services including the banking financial services and insurance industries in  approximately  of our total revenues was derived from clients in those industries including  of our total revenues that were derived from clients in the insurance industry our business largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients and potential clients in these industries adverse developments in these industries or the other select industries to which we provide services could further unfavorably affect our business in particular we currently derive and are likely to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients located in the us any future decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending could result in a decrease in demand for our services particularly our transformation services thus reducing our revenues continued high unemployment rates in the us could also adversely affect the demand for our services other developments in response to economic events such as consolidations restructurings or reorganizations particularly involving our clients could also cause the demand for our services to decline any future disruptions in the commercial credit markets may impact liquidity in the global credit market as greatly or even more than in recent years and we may not be able to predict the impact such worsening conditions will have on our targeted industries in general and our results of operations specifically future turbulence in global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our clients market disruptions may limit our ability to access financing or increase our cost of financing to meet liquidity needs and affect the ability of our customers to use credit to    table of contents purchase our services or to make timely payments to us resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the us and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing recently proposed legislation or otherwise we have based our strategy of future growth on certain assumptions regarding our industry and future developments in the market for outsourcing services for example we believe that there will continue to be changes in product and service requirements and investments in the products offered by our clients will continue to increase however the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse offshore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the us and elsewhere and many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the us and elsewhere in addition there has been limited publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that use offshore outsourcing particularly in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services to offshore providers to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with using an offshore provider any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate out of facilities located in the us and elsewhere a variety of us federal and state legislation has been proposed that if enacted could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the us for example legislation has been proposed that would require offshore providers to identify where they are located and that would require notice to individuals whose personal information is disclosed to nonus companies in addition bills have been proposed that would provide tax and other economic incentives for companies that create employment in the us by reducing their offshore outsourcing other bills have proposed requiring call centers to disclose their geographic locations requiring notice to individuals whose personal information is disclosed to nonus affiliates or subcontractors requiring disclosures of companies foreign outsourcing practices or restricting us private sector companies that have federal government contracts federal grants or guaranteed loan programs from outsourcing their services to offshore service providers because most of our clients are located in the us any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could adversely impact our ability to do business with us clients and have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in other countries such as the uk there has also been some negative publicity and concern expressed regarding the possible effect of job losses caused by outsourcing legislation enacted in the uk provides that if a company transfers or outsources its business or a part of its business to a transferee or a service provider the employees who were employed in such business are entitled to become employed by the transferee or service provider on the same terms and conditions as they had been employed before the transfer the dismissal of such employees as a result of such transfer of business is deemed unfair dismissal and entitles the employees to compensation as a result we may become liable for redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the uk who outsource business to us we are generally indemnified in our existing contracts with clients in the uk to the extent we incur losses or additional costs due to the application of this legislation to us and we intend to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients however if we are unable to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients we may be liable under any agreements we enter into in the future with uk clients similar legislation has also been enacted in certain other european jurisdictions our client contracts contain certain termination and other provisions that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition most of our client contracts may be terminated by our clients without cause and do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business any failure to meet a clients expectations could result in a cancellation or nonrenewal of a contract or a decrease in business provided to us we may not be able to replace    table of contents any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us which would reduce our revenues the loss of or financial difficulties at any of our large clients would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows a number of our contracts allow the client in certain limited circumstances to request a benchmark study comparing our pricing and performance with that of an agreed list of other service providers for comparable services based on the results of the study and depending on the reasons for any unfavorable variance we may be required to make improvements in the services we provide or reduce the pricing for services on a prospective basis to be performed under the remaining term of the contract or our client could elect to terminate the contract which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition many of our contracts contain provisions that would require us to pay penalties to our clients andor provide our clients with the right to terminate the contract if we do not meet preagreed service level requirements or if we do not provide certain productivity benefits failure to meet these requirements or accurately estimate the productivity benefits could result in the payment of significant penalties by us to our clients which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition some of our contracts with clients specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the contract the client has the right to terminate the contract these provisions may result in our contracts being terminated if there is such a change in control resulting in a potential loss of revenues in addition these provisions may act as a deterrent to any attempt by a third party to acquire our company we may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates our industry is labor intensive and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract hire train and retain qualified employees including our ability to attract employees with needed skills in the geographic areas in which we operate the industry including us experiences high employee turnover our turnover rate for employees with exl for more than  days was  for the year ended december   there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients increased competition for these professionals could have an adverse effect on us a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees particularly among our higher skilled workforce would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency productivity and profit margins and could lead to a decline in demand for our services high turnover rates generally do not impact our revenues as we factor the attrition rate into our pricing models by maintaining additional employees for each process however high turnover rates do increase our cost of revenues and therefore impact our profit margins due to higher recruitment training and retention costs high employee turnover increases training recruitment and retention costs because we must maintain larger hiring training and human resources departments and it also increases our operating costs due to having to reallocate certain business processes among our operations centers where we have access to the skilled workforce needed for our business in addition our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain personnel with skills that keep pace with the demand for outsourcing evolving industry standards and changing client preferences a lack of sufficiently qualified personnel could also inhibit our ability to establish operations in new markets and our efforts to expand geographically our failure to attract train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we have a long selling cycle for our outsourcing services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments we have a long selling cycle for our outsourcing services which requires significant investment of capital resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services including testing our    table of contents services for a limited period of time and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them therefore our selling cycle which generally ranges from six to eighteen months is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other providers or inhouse offshore resources and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes in addition we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations thereby delaying further the implementation process our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows once we are engaged by a client it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues when we are engaged by a client after the selling process for our outsourcing services it takes from four to six weeks to integrate the clients systems with ours and up to three months thereafter to build up our services to the clients requirements depending on the complexity of the processes being implemented these time periods may be significantly longer implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle therefore we do not recognize significant revenues until after we have completed the implementation phase we enter into longterm contracts with our clients and our failure to estimate the resources and time required for our contracts may negatively affect our profitability the initial terms of our outsourcing contracts typically range from three to five years in many of our outsourcing contracts we commit to longterm pricing with our clients and therefore bear the risk of cost overruns completion delays wage inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with these contracts if we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a contract future wage inflation rates or currency exchange rates or fail to accurately hedge our currency exchange rate exposure or if we fail to complete our contractual obligations within the contracted timeframe our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected consistency in our revenues from period to period depends in part on our ability to reflect the changing demands and needs of our existing and potential clients if we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our clients and potential clients our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected most of our contracts use a pricing model that provides for hourly or annual billing rates industry pricing models are evolving however and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transactionbased or other pricing models if we are unable to obtain operating efficiencies or if we make inaccurate assumptions for contacts with transactionbased pricing our profitability may be negatively affected if we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing protocols our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors in addition the services we provide to our clients and the revenues and income from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts changes over time including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide furthermore our clients some of which have experienced significant and adverse changes in their prospects substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions automate some or    table of contents all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work inhouse or to other providers any of which could reduce our profitability any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients or any requirement to lower our prices would harm our business our profitability will suffer if we are not able to appropriately price our services or manage our asset utilization levels our profitability is largely a function of the efficiency with which we utilize our assets in particular our people and our operations centers and the pricing that we are able to obtain for our services our asset utilization levels are affected by a number of factors including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments attract train and retain employees forecast demand for our services and maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our locations as well as our need to dedicate resources to employee training and development and other typically nonchargeable activities the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services substantial price competition introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors our ability to accurately estimate attain and sustain revenues from client engagements our ability to estimate resources for longterm pricing margins and cash flows for longterm contracts and general economic and political conditions therefore if we are unable to appropriately price our services or manage our asset utilization levels there could be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our transformation services are cyclical and based on specific projects involving shortterm contracts our transformation services such as our decision analytics finance transformation and operations and process excellence services are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles changes in the deadlines or the scope of work required for compliance with the requirements of legislation applicable to our clients could have a significant impact on certain service offerings of our finance transformation services business in addition a significant portion of our transformation services consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period the shortterm nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from providing transformation services our operating results may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult for us to make accurate financial forecasts our operating results may vary significantly from period to period although our existing agreements with original terms of three or more years provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business the long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of entering into definitive agreements with new clients the timing of revenue recognition under new client agreements also varies depending on when we complete the implementation phase with new clients the completion of implementation varies significantly based upon the complexity of the processes being implemented our periodtoperiod results have in the past and may also in the future fluctuate due to other factors including client losses delays or failure by our clients to provide anticipated business variations in employee utilization rates resulting from changes in our clients operations delays or difficulties in expanding our operations centers and infrastructure including hiring new employees or constructing new operations centers changes to our pricing structure or that of our competitors currency fluctuations seasonal changes in the operations of our clients and other events identified in this annual report on form k our revenues are also affected by changes in pricing under our contracts at the time of renewal or by pricing under new contracts in    table of contents addition most of our contracts do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business further as we increase our capabilities utilizing technology service platforms and other softwarebased services we expect that revenues from such services will continue to grow in proportion to our total revenues revenues from annual maintenance and support contracts for our software platforms provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base whereas revenues from new license sales and implementation projects have a long selling cycle and it is difficult to predict the timing of when such new contracts will be signed which may lead to fluctuations in our short term revenues all these factors may make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that we do not receive as a result of delays in implementing our services or client losses if our actual results do not meet any estimated results that we announce or if we underperform market expectations as a result of such factors trading prices for our common stock could be adversely affected our senior management team is critical to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business our future success substantially depends on the continued services and performance of the members of our management team and other key employees possessing technical and business capabilities including industry expertise that are difficult to replace specifically the loss of the services of rohit kapoor our vice chairman and chief executive officer could seriously impair our ability to continue to manage and expand our business there is intense competition for experienced senior management and personnel with technical and industry expertise in the industry in which we operate and we may not be able to retain these officers or key employees although we have entered into employment and noncompetition agreements with all of our executive officers certain terms of those agreements may not be enforceable and in any event these agreements do not ensure the continued service of these executive officers in addition we currently do not maintain key person insurance covering any member of our management team the loss of any of our key employees particularly to competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows our inability to effectively manage our rapid infrastructure and personnel growth could have a material adverse effect on our operations results of operations and financial condition since we were founded in april  we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our operations we have sixteen operations centers in india six operations centers in the us three operations centers in the philippines and one operations center in each of bulgaria romania the czech republic and malaysia our headcount has increased from approximately  on december   to approximately  on december   we expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations where we operate in order to address the anticipated growth of our business we are also continuing to look for operations centers at additional locations outside of our current operating geographies we believe expanding our geographic base of operations will provide higher value to our clients by decreasing the risks of operating from a single country including potential shortages of skilled employees increases in wage costs during strong economic times and currency fluctuations while also giving our clients access to a wider talent pool and establishing a base in countries that may be competitive in the future however we may not be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and employee expansion open additional operations centers or hire additional skilled employees as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our clients and we may not be able to develop and improve our internal systems we also need to manage cultural differences between our employee populations and that may create a risk for employment law claims our inability to execute our growth strategy to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we may engage in strategic acquisitions or transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as part of our business strategy we intend to continue to selectively consider acquisitions or investments some of which may be material through the acquisitions we pursue we may seek opportunities to expand the    table of contents scope of our existing services add new clients or enter new geographic markets we have completed seven acquisitions since our inception in april  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable candidates in the future for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to finance potential acquisitions or be able to consummate any desired transactions our failure to close transactions with potential acquisition targets for which we have invested significant time and resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows acquisitions including completed acquisitions involve a number of risks including diversion of managements attention ability to finance the acquisition on attractive terms failure to retain key personnel or valuable customers legal liabilities and the need to amortize acquired intangible assets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows future acquisitions may also result in the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities the intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business however such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring that the intellectual property is dependent upon licenses from third parties that the acquired business infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others or that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to execution integration or underperformance relative to prior expectations our management may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or maintain our standards controls and policies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition consequently any acquisition we do complete may not result in longterm benefits to us following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls and other transition services to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us we may not be able to realize the entire book value of goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions as of december   we had approximately  million of goodwill and  million of intangible assets we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired and we monitor for impairment of goodwill relating to all acquisitions goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least once on an annual basis as of december  of each year based on a number of factors including operating results business plans and future cash flows impairment testing of goodwill may also be performed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount we perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on the results of the qualitative assessment we perform the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in the event that the book value of goodwill is impaired any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment we cannot assure you that future impairment of goodwill will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no assurance    table of contents that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the credit crisis that began in  and the related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our operations staff and other employees for example wage costs in india have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the us and europe for comparably skilled professionals which has been one of our competitive advantages however because of rapid economic growth in india increased demand for outsourcing services from india and increased competition for skilled employees in india wages for comparably skilled employees in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the us and europe which may reduce this competitive advantage we may need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires wages are generally higher for employees performing transformation services than for employees performing outsourcing services as the scale of our transformation services increases wages as a percentage of revenues will likely increase to the extent that we are not able to control or share wage increases with our clients wage increases may reduce our margins we will attempt to control such costs by our efforts to add capacity in locations where we consider wage levels of skilled personnel to be satisfactory but we may not be successful in doing so additionally because a majority of our employees are based in india and paid in indian rupees while our revenues are primarily in us dollars and uk pounds sterling our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee and the us dollar fluctuate significantly if more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize our profitability may be adversely affected india has stringent labor legislation that protects employee interests including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment though we are exempt from some of these labor laws at present under exceptions in some states for providers of itenabled services there can be no assurance that such laws will not become applicable to us in the future if these labor laws become applicable to our employees it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies and attract and employ the numbers of sufficiently qualified candidates that we need or discharge employees and our compensation expenses may increase significantly regulations in other countries in which we operate also regulate our relations with our employees in addition our employees may in the future form unions if employees at any of our operations centers become eligible for union membership we may be required to raise wage levels or grant other benefits that could result in an increase in our compensation expenses in which case our profitability may be adversely affected the government of india has recently focused on the occupational health and safety concerns experienced by workers in the outsourcing industry the introduction of legislation imposing restrictions on working hours or conditions of professionals in the outsourcing industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition    table of contents we face significant competition from usbased and nonusbased outsourcing and it companies and from our clients who may perform outsourcing services themselves either inhouse in the us or through offshore groups or other arrangements the market for outsourcing services is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify and increase from a number of sources we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are breadth and depth of process expertise knowledge of industries served service quality the ability to attract train and retain qualified people compliance rigor global delivery capabilities price and sales and client management capabilities we also face competition from nonusbased outsourcing and it companies including those in the uk and india and usbased outsourcing and it companies further a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services we provide in addition the trend toward offshore outsourcing international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes such as cloud computing will result in new and different competition for our services these competitors may include entrants from the communications software and data networking industries or entrants in geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate some of these existing and future competitors have greater financial personnel and other resources a broader range of service offerings greater technological expertise more recognizable brand names and more established relationships in industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future in addition some of our competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs or enter into similar arrangements with potential clients the trend in multivendor relationships has been growing which could reduce our revenues to the extent that we are required to modify the terms of our relationship with clients or that clients obtain services from other vendors increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in reduced operating margins which could harm our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we expect competition to intensify in the future as more companies enter our markets increased competition may result in lower prices and volumes higher costs for resources especially people and lower profitability we may not be able to supply clients with services that they deem superior and at competitive prices and we may lose business to our competitors any inability to compete effectively would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition we may disrupt our clients operations as a result of inadequate service or other factors including telecommunications or technology downtime or interruptions the services we provide are often critical to our clients businesses and any failure to provide those services could result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure most of our agreements with clients contain service level and performance requirements including requirements relating to the quality of our services failure to consistently meet service requirements of a client or errors made by our employees in the course of delivering services to our clients could disrupt the clients business and result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for damages against us additionally we could incur certain liabilities if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal control failures or processing errors or impair our clients ability to comply with its own internal control requirements our dependence on our offshore operations centers requires us to maintain active voice and data communications among our operations centers our international technology hubs and our clients offices although we maintain redundant facilities and communications links disruptions could result from among other things technical breakdowns computer glitches and viruses and weather conditions we also depend on certain significant vendors for facility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at those technology hubs any failure by these vendors to perform those services any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our clients have a negative impact on our reputation cause us to lose clients reduce our revenues and harm our business    table of contents our contractual limitations on liability with our clients and third parties may not be enforceable under most of our agreements with our clients our liability for breach of certain of our obligations is generally limited to actual damages suffered by the client and is typically capped at the fees paid or payable to us for a period of time under the relevant agreement these limitations and caps on liability may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages in addition certain liabilities such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients including intellectual property infringement claims or liability for fraud or breaches of confidentiality are generally not limited under those agreements because our agreements are governed by laws of multiple jurisdictions the interpretation of certain provisions and the availability of certain defenses to us may vary which in certain circumstances may contribute to uncertainty as to the scope of our potential liability our business could be materially and adversely affected if we do not protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe on the intellectual property of others our success depends in part on certain methodologies practices tools and technical expertise we utilize in providing our services we engage in designing developing implementing and maintaining applications and other proprietary materials in order to protect our rights in these various materials we may seek protection under trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws we also generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients and potential clients and third party vendors and seek to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information for our employees and independent contractors we generally require confidentiality and workforhire agreements these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage we have submitted patent applications in  for certain proprietary technology we also have submitted and expect to continue to submit us federal and foreign trademark applications for names and designations of our company and various business lines and service offerings we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining patents or trademarks for which we have applied we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively which may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them to the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents or other means other parties including former employees with knowledge of our intellectual property may leave and seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others advantage we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights and any such steps may not be successful infringement by others of our intellectual property including the costs of enforcing our intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition competitors or others may allege that our systems processes marketing or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights including patents nonpracticing entities also have been bringing patent infringement claims on a more frequent basis we could be required to indemnify our clients if they are sued by a third party for intellectual property infringement arising from materials that we have provided to the clients in connection with our services and deliverables we may not be successful in defending against any intellectual property claims or in obtaining licenses or an agreement to resolve any intellectual property disputes given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation we cannot provide assurances that a future assertion of an infringement claim against us or our clients will not cause us to alter our business practices lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses or pay significant monetary damages any such claim for intellectual property infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition    table of contents new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of  other sec regulations consumer financial protection bureau and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards in particular our efforts to comply with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients we are typically required to process and sometimes collect andor store sensitive data of our clients end customers in connection with our services including names addresses social security numbers personal health information credit card account numbers checking and savings account numbers and payment history records such as account closures and returned checks in addition we collect and store data regarding our employees as a result we are subject to various data protection and privacy laws in the countries in which we operate in addition many of our agreements with our clients do not include any limitation on our liability to them with respect to breaches of our obligation to keep the information we receive from them confidential we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber security and to protecting confidential client and customer data however any network infrastructure may be vulnerable to rapidly evolving cyber attacks and our user data and corporate systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties including cyberattacks employee error malfeasance a combination of these or otherwise allowing an unauthorized party to obtain access to our data or our users or customers data additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users or customers data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or    table of contents degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation remediation costs increased costs for security measures loss of revenue damage to our reputation and potential liability if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates sensitive data discloses or distributes any such data in an unauthorized manner we could be subject to significant liability and lawsuits from our clients or their own customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws or investigations and penalties from regulators under some of our client contracts we have agreed to pay for the costs of remediation or notice to end users or credit monitoring as well as other costs we have obtained privacy and network security insurance for claims related to breaches of our privacy and network security including unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive data suspension or interruption of our network infrastructure transmission of computer viruses or failure to comply with our privacy and network security procedures however such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claims cyber attacks penetrating the network security of our data centers or any unauthorized disclosure or access to confidential information and data of our clients or their end customers could also have a negative impact on our reputation and client confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we may not be fully insured for all losses we may incur although we attempt to limit and mitigate our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors or omissions through contractual provisions limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages in addition certain liabilities such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients are generally not limited under those agreements we also could be sued directly for claims that could be significant such as infringement of intellectual property rights violation of wage and hour laws or systemic discrimination although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions property damage or loss and breaches of privacy and network security that coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim insurance is not available for

the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are excluded from our insurance coverage or exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows    table of contents we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and because we are also a holding company we may be unable to pay dividends for the foreseeable future we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition and results of operations capital requirements contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit agreement business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant furthermore because we are also a holding company any dividend payments would also depend on the cash flow from our subsidiaries accordingly under certain circumstances we may not be able to pay dividends even if our board of directors would otherwise deem it appropriate we may choose to expand operations to additional countries and may not be successful in maintaining our current profit margins in our new locations due to factors beyond our control we are currently continuing to evaluate additional locations outside our current operating geographies in which to invest in operations centers we cannot predict the extent of government support availability of qualified workers or monetary and economic conditions in other countries although some of these factors will influence our decision to establish operations in another country there are inherent risks beyond our control including exposure to currency fluctuations political uncertainties foreign exchange restrictions and foreign regulatory restrictions one or more of these factors or other factors relating to expanded international operations could result in increased operating expenses and make it more difficult for us to manage our costs and operations which could harm our business and negatively impact our operating results we may increase the range of services that we provide to our clients and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate we are exploring opportunities to provide services that we have not provided to date should we decide to expand our service offerings our results of operations may be negatively affected during any transition or growth period before such offerings achieve profitability for example we may need to expand our training of our existing employees or recruit new speciallytrained employees to provide these services which could increase our costs of revenues disproportionately to the revenues generated by such services other challenges we may face include the diversion of our managements attention attracting and retaining clients for such services integrating any new services into our current suite of services and managing any resulting growth in our operations failure to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on our operations our clients business operations are often subject to regulation and our clients may require that we perform our services in a manner that will enable them to comply with applicable regulations our clients are located around the world and the laws and regulations that apply include among others united states federal laws such as the grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act state laws on debt collection in the united states and the financial services act in the united kingdom as well as similar consumer protection laws in other countries in which our clients customers are based failure to perform our services in a manner that complies with any such requirements could result in breaches of contracts with our clients in addition we are required under various laws to obtain and maintain permits and licenses for the conduct of our business in all jurisdictions in which we have operations including india and in some cases where our clients receive our services including the united states and europe if we do not maintain our licenses or other qualifications to provide our services or if we do not adapt to changes in legislation or regulation we may have to cease operations in the relevant jurisdictions and may not be able to provide services to existing clients or be able to attract new clients in addition we may be required to expend significant resources in order to comply with laws and regulations in the jurisdictions mentioned above any failure to abide by regulations relating either    table of contents to our business or our clients businesses may also in some limited circumstances result in civil fines and criminal penalties for us any such ceasing of operations or civil or criminal actions may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our stock price continues to be volatile our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of among other reasons variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that could delay or discourage business combinations and takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult expensive or otherwise discourage a tender offer or a change in control or takeover attempt by a thirdparty that is opposed by our board of directors these provisions include classified board provisions provisions permitting the board of directors to fill vacancies created by its expansion provisions permitting the removal of directors only for cause and with a    ⁄   stockholder vote provisions requiring a    ⁄   stockholder vote for certain amendments to our organizational documents provisions barring stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or requiring one to be called or from taking action by written consent and provisions that set forth advance notice procedures for stockholders nominations of directors and proposals for consideration at meetings of stockholders these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in management that stockholders consider favorable additionally because we are incorporated in delaware we are subject to section  of the delaware general corporation law section  may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning  or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future which could reduce the market price of our stock risks related to the international nature of our business our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry or if we are not eligible for these benefits we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions our tax expense and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations and the potential adverse outcome of tax examinations changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which may result from a decline in our profitability or changes in tax rates or legislation could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense under the indian income tax act  our operations centers in india from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues benefitted up to march   from a tenyear holiday from indian corporate income taxes in respect of their export profits under the software technology parks of india stpi scheme in the absence of this tax holiday income derived from our indian operations is taxed up to the maximum tax rate generally applicable to indian enterprises which as of december   was     table of contents during the last five years we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the special economic zones act the special economic zones act introduced a year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones sezs under the special economic zones act qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to i  of their export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations ii  of such export profits for the next five years and iii  of the export profits for a further five years subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements the special economic zones act provides among other restrictions that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment beyond a prescribed limit to new sez locations we anticipate establishing additional operations centers in sezs or other tax advantaged locations in the future the direct taxes code bill  the direct taxes code proposed by the government of india and currently pending before the indian parliament proposes grandfathering the existing profitbased tax benefits for operations centers in sezs already receiving such tax benefits the direct taxes code also proposes discontinuing profitbased incentives for operations centers in sezs set up after march   and replaces them with investmentbased incentives for operations centers in sezs established after that date however the bill is still pending before the parliament and owing to ensuing general elections and the fact that the parliament is not scheduled to be in sessions before the general elections there is a remote possibility that the direct taxes code will be legislated before that date accordingly we expect to continue receiving the benefit of tax deductions for our existing operations centers in sezs pursuant to the current regulations beyond the currently proposed march   sunset date if the direct taxes code is enacted into law before that date and if this grandfathering does not happen under the direct taxes code our operations centers in sezs may not receive profitbased tax benefits and our overall tax rate may increase over the next few years and that such increase may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we also benefit from a corporate tax holiday in the philippines for our operations centers established there over the last five years the tax holiday will expire for one of our centers in  and for remaining centers the tax holiday will expire over the next few years which may lead to an increase in our overall tax rate if the transfer pricing arrangements we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be inappropriate our tax liability may increase us and indian transfer pricing regulations as well as regulations applicable in other countries in which we operate require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an armslength price transactions among the companys subsidiaries and the company may be required to satisfy such requirements accordingly the company determines the pricing among its associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control the tax authorities have jurisdiction to review this arrangement and in the event that they determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate the company may incur increased tax liability including accrued interest and penalties which would cause our tax expense to increase possibly materially thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows the company is currently involved in disputes with the indian tax authorities over the application of some of its transfer pricing policies for past years please see note  to our audited consolidated financial statements for details introduction of tax legislation and disputes with tax authorities may have an adverse effect on our operations and our overall tax rate governments in countries in which we operate or provide services could enact new tax legislation which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition our ability to repatriate surplus earnings from our operations centers in a taxefficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local laws possible changes in such laws and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate which would    table of contents have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and determines that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate or that other income of our affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction we may incur increased tax liability including accrued interest and penalties which would cause our tax expense to increase possibly materially thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows the company had undertaken a legal entity rationalization project the first phase of which became effective in  to simplify the global legal entity structure and remove redundancies and reduce compliance risks and costs associated with it furthermore we also intend to optimize the tax and financial efficiencies of the group structure as a result we may carry out certain reorganizations under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate and take certain positions to qualify for tax neutrality for such internal reorganization we cannot assure you that there will not be any actions brought by the tax authorities of certain jurisdictions if this reorganization is implemented our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it may be difficult to enforce these intellectual property rights both within and outside of the us india is a member of the berne convention an international intellectual property treaty and has agreed to recognize protections on intellectual property rights conferred under the laws of other foreign countries including the laws of the us there can be no assurance however that the laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the us india and the other jurisdictions in which we operate and the contractual and other protective measures we take are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property or that such laws will not change among other anticorruption laws and regulations including the uk bribery act we are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit the fcpa also requires covered companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate these anticorruption laws or regulations although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations furthermore the us government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business    table of contents currency exchange rate fluctuations in the various currencies in which we do business especially the indian rupee and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations a substantial portion of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  in  or uk pounds sterling  in  a substantial portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees and philippine peso  and  in  respectively we report our financial results in us dollars the exchange rates among the indian rupee and other currencies in which we incur costs or receive revenues and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future see item aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our results of operations could be adversely affected over time by certain movements in exchange rates particularly if the indian rupee or other currencies in which we incur expenses or receive revenues appreciate against the us dollar although we take steps to hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupeeus dollar uk pounds sterlingus dollar and philippine pesous dollar foreign currency exposures there is no assurance that our hedging strategy will be successful or that the hedging markets will have sufficient liquidity or depth to allow us to implement our hedging strategy in a costeffective manner any failure by our hedging counterparties to meet their contractual obligations could materially and adversely affect our profitability we are subject to legal restrictions on hedging activities as well as the convertibility of currencies in india this could limit our ability to use cash generated in one country in another country and could limit our ability to hedge our exposures terrorist attacks and other acts of violence involving india the philippines the us or other countries could adversely affect the financial markets result in a loss of client confidence and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war including those involving india the philippines the us or other countries may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to economic recession which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition these events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to our operations centers south asia has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries including bangladesh pakistan and china in recent years there have been several instances of military confrontations along the indopakistani border there continues to be potential for hostilities between india and pakistan due to recent terrorist activities and the geopolitical climate along the border although this has not been the case to date such political tensions could create a perception that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by companies with operations in india which could have a material adverse effect on the market for our services furthermore if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons we might not be able to continue our operations in india our insurance policies may not insure us against losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war we may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience we intend to continue to expand our global footprint in order to maintain an appropriate cost structure and meet our clients delivery needs this may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate it may involve expanding into less developed countries which may have less political social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems as we expand our business into new countries we may encounter regulatory personnel technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses or delay our ability to start up our operations or become profitable in such countries this may affect our relationships with our clients and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition    table of contents a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic and political uncertainties in india our principal operating subsidiaries are incorporated in india and a majority of our assets and our professionals are located in india we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india in the early s india experienced significant inflation low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of foreign currency reserves the indian government however has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy indias government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including our industry certain of those programs which have benefited us include tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation we cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue various factors such as changes in the current federal government could trigger significant changes in indias economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular the choice of india as an outsourcing destination and our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in india including changes in exchange rates and controls interest rates and taxation policies as well as social stability and political economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future in particular india has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead these challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education our ability to recruit train and retain qualified employees develop and operate our operations centers and attract and retain clients could be adversely affected if india does not successfully meet these challenges restrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the us which could have a material adverse effect on future revenues the vast majority of our employees are indian nationals the ability of some of our executives and employees to work with and meet our us and european clients and our clients from other countries depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits in response to terrorist attacks the recent global economic downturn and public sentiments about the high unemployment rates in their respective economies us and european immigration authorities have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas immigration laws in those countries may also require us to meet certain levels of compensation and comply with other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas these restrictions have increased the application fees for certain types of visas and have significantly lengthened the time requirements to obtain visas for our personnel which has in the past resulted and may continue to result in delays in the ability of our personnel to meet with our clients in addition immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces economic conditions or other events including terrorist attacks we cannot predict the political or economic events that could affect immigration laws or any restrictive impact those events could have on obtaining or monitoring entry visas for our professionals if we are unable to obtain the necessary visas for personnel who need to get to our clients sites or if the duration of such visas is shortened or if such visas are delayed we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide these services on a timely and cost effective basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are vulnerable to natural disasters technical disruptions and manmade events that could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition our operations centers and our data and voice communications particularly in india and the philippines may be damaged or disrupted as a result of natural disasters such as earthquakes floods heavy rains epidemics tsunamis and cyclones technical disruptions such as electricity or infrastructure breakdowns including damage to telecommunications cables computer glitches and electronic viruses or manmade events such as protests    table of contents riots and labor unrest such events may lead to the disruption of information systems and telecommunication services for sustained periods they also may make it difficult or impossible for employees to reach our business locations damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our reputation our relationships with our clients our leadership teams ability to administer and supervise our business or it may cause us to incur substantial additional expenditure to repair or replace damaged equipment or delivery centers we may also be liable to our clients for disruption in service resulting from such damage or destruction while we currently have commercial liability insurance our insurance coverage may not be sufficient furthermore we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future or at all prolonged disruption of our services would also entitle our clients to terminate their contracts with us any of the above factors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition investors may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the us against our subsidiaries in india or our executive officers our primary operating subsidiaries are organized outside the us and a number of our executive officers reside outside of the us a substantial portion of our assets are located in india as a result you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside in india outside their jurisdiction of residence in addition you may be unable to enforce against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence judgments obtained in courts of the us including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the us sections a and section  of the indian civil procedure code  the civil code govern recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments section a of the civil code provides for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment without having to file an original suit in india provided such judgments have been rendered by courts in a country or territory outside india which the government of india has declared to be a reciprocating territory we have been advised by our indian counsel that the us and india do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments other than certain arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the us based on civil liability whether or not it is predicated upon the federal securities laws of the us would not be enforceable in india as such however if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in india based on a final judgment that has been obtained in the us section  of the civil code provides that the foreign judgment will be conclusive as to certain matters the suit must be brought in india within three years of the date of the foreign judgment it is unlikely however that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a court in the us if an action is brought in india it is also unlikely that an indian court would enforce judgments obtained in the us if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with indian practice    table of contents item b unresolved staff comments none   item  properties our corporate headquarters are located in new york new york we have sixteen

overview we are a leading provider of business process solutions utilizing operations management analytics and technology we use our focused industry and process expertise to create a positive business impact on our clients operations we customize our services to improve the economics of our clients business performance and transform organizations to be leaner and more flexible we break our business into two segments outsourcing and transformation services our outsourcing services provide front middle and backoffice processing for our clients who are primarily global  companies we also offer a number of transformation services including decision analytics finance transformation and operations consulting services our global delivery network comprising of highly trained industry and process specialists across the united states europe and asia is a key asset we operate sixteen operations centers in india six operations centers in the us three operations centers in the philippines and one operations center in each of bulgaria romania malaysia and the czech republic revenues for the year ended december   we had total revenues of  million compared to total revenues of  million for the year ended december   an increase of  million or  revenues from outsourcing services increased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   revenues from transformation services increased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   we serve clients mainly in the us and the uk with these two regions generating approximately  and  respectively of our total revenues for the year ended december   and approximately  and  respectively of our total revenues for the year ended december   in the years ended december   and  our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for  and  of our total revenues respectively none of the clients accounted for more than  of our total revenues in the year ended december   compared to one client in the year ended december   although we are increasing and diversifying our customer base we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients we derived revenues from  and  new clients for our services in the years ended december   and  respectively in addition another two clients acquired during the year  did not generate revenues in  but are expected to start generating revenues from  on november   we received a termination notice from travelers under the services agreement travelers represented  of our total revenues for the year ended december   while this termination did not have a material impact on our calendar year  revenues we do estimate a reduction in  revenues of between  million and  million due to certain services we currently provide to travelers being transitioned away from us throughout  in addition we expect that we will reimburse travelers for certain of their expenses incurred in connection with the termination which will further reduce our revenues in  we also expect that we will provide certain disentanglement services to travelers at our expense during the transition period which will increase our expenses in  we are still discussing the termination process with travelers and as a result at this point cannot reasonably estimate the total amount of reimbursements we may make to travelers or what internal costs we will incur as a result of the termination    table of contents our business we break our business into two segments outsourcing services and transformation services we market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams which are aligned by key industry verticals and crossindustry domains such as finance and accounting our sales and client management teams operate from the us and europe outsourcing services we provide our clients with a range of outsourcing services principally in the insurance healthcare utilities banking and financial services and travel transportation and logistics sectors as well as crossindustry outsourcing services such as finance and accounting services we serve primarily the needs of global  companies in these sectors our outsourcing services involve the transfer to us of select business operations of a client such as claims processing policy administration and finance and accounting after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis as part of this transfer we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant outsourcing services implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the clients customers each client contract has different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the outsourcing services we provide to any of our clients particularly under our general framework agreements and the revenues and income that we derive from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide for most outsourcing services we enter into longterm agreements with our clients with typical initial terms ranging from three to eight years these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period although these agreements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business the long selling cycle for our outsourcing services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions revenues under new client contracts also vary depending on when we complete the selling cycle and the implementation phase to the extent our client contracts do not contain provisions to the contrary we bear the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our contracts we hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupeeus dollar philippine pesous dollar and uk pound sterlingus dollar foreign currency exposure we have recently been observing a shift in industry pricing models toward transactionbased pricing and other pricing models we believe this trend will continue and we have begun to use transactionbased and other pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a billing rate model to a transactionbased or other pricing model such models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain our operating margins in addition we have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multivendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs we believe that the trend toward multivendor relationships will continue a multivendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor which can result in significantly reduced operating margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor to the extent our large clients expand their use of multivendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors our operating margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients within our outsourcing services we also offer platform technology services by use of our proprietary technology tools and platforms to provide increasingly complex services for our insurance and healthcare clients we have added these capabilities through acquisitions over the last few years key platform technology offerings include careradius ® and maxmc ® each of which are healthcare management software platforms for health    table of contents insurers and providers lifepro ® an insurance policy administration platform and subrosource  a subrogation services platform for property and casualty insurers depending on the platform the fees derived from our platform technologies may be based on licenses installation support and maintenance andor recoveries from claims we believe our proprietary platform technology will be an important source of growth in the future as clients choose to transfer certain business functions to a thirdpartyowned technology provider as we increase our capabilities utilizing technology service platforms and other softwarebased services we expect that revenues from such services will continue to grow in proportion to our total revenues revenues from annual maintenance and support contracts for our software platforms provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base and are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts new license sales and implementation projects have a long selling cycle and it is difficult to predict the timing of when such new contracts will be signed which may lead to fluctuations in our revenues over short term we anticipate that revenues from our outsourcing services will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base both organically and through acquisitions transformation services our transformation services offer positive business change for our clients by utilizing sophisticated tools and techniques and highly trained analysts we i provide insight into our clients current and future financial and operational results using analytics ii improve clients operating environments through cost reduction and increased efficiency and productivity initiatives and iii enhance the risk and control environments within our clients operations whether or not those operations are outsourced to us our key areas of transformation services are decision analytics finance transformation and operations and process excellence consulting our transformation services consist of both recurring and specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one to three years these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period the shortterm nature and specificity of these projects could lead to further material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses our transformation services can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles we have experienced a significant increase in demand for our annuitybased transformation services which are engagements that are contracted for one to threeyear terms expenses cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of        employee costs which include salary bonus and other compensation expenses recruitment and training costs employee insurance transport and meals rewards and recognition for certain employees and noncash stock compensation expense and        costs relating to our facilities and communications network which include telecommunication and it costs facilities and customer management support operational expenses for our outsourcing centers rent expenses and travel and other billable costs to our clients the most significant components of our cost of revenues are employee compensation recruitment training transport meals rewards and recognition and employee insurance salary levels employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues salary increases for most of our operations personnel are generally awarded each year effective april  accordingly employee costs are generally lower in the first quarter of each year compared to the rest of the year we make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to    table of contents experience a higherthanexpected number of unassigned employees which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency productivity and profit margins in addition cost of revenues also includes a noncash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operating centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally in particular we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients and provide existing staff with additional skill sets there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients as our existing competitors continue to grow and as new competitors enter the market we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals however a significant portion of our client contracts include inflationbased adjustments to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues see item arisk factorsemployee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin cost of revenues is also affected by our long selling cycle and implementation period for our outsourcing services which require significant commitments of capital resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs in addition once a client engages us in a new contract our cost of revenues may represent a higher percentage of revenues until the implementation phase for that contract generally three to four months is completed selling general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries of senior management and other support personnel legal and other professional fees telecommunications utilities travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel sales commission travel and brand building client events and conferences we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding we also expect our costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development performance management and training programs however our sga as a percentage of revenues has remained flat at  in  as compared to  as decreases due to operating leverage were offset by our acquisition in  sga expenses also include acquisitionrelated costs professional fees which represent the costs of third party legal tax accounting and other advisors bad debt allowance and noncash amortization of stock compensation expenses related to our issuance of equity awards to senior management members of our board of directors other support personnel and consultants depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation of our tangible assets including network equipment cabling computers office furniture and equipment motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets as we add new facilities and expand our existing operations centers we expect that depreciation expense will increase reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers servers and other infrastructure we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions    table of contents foreign exchange exchange rates we report our financial results in us dollars a significant portion of our total revenues however are earned in uk pounds sterling  and  respectively of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees  and  respectively of our total costs for the years ended december   and  and the philippine peso  and  respectively of our total costs for the years ended december   and  the exchange rates among the indian rupee the philippine peso the uk pound sterling czech koruna and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future as well the results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the indian rupee and uk pound sterling appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar see notes  and  to our consolidated financial statements and item aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency risk currency regulation according to the prevailing foreign exchange regulations in india an exporter of outsourcing and transformation services that is registered with a software technology park in india such as our indian subsidiaries in india is required to realize its export proceeds within a period of  months from the date of exports similarly in the event that such exporter has received any advance against exports in foreign exchange from its overseas customers it will have to render the requisite services so that the advances so received are earned within a period of  months if those subsidiaries in india did not meet these conditions they would be required to obtain permission from the reserve bank of india income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions our tax expense and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations and the potential adverse outcome of tax examinations changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which may result from a decline in our profitability or changes in tax rates or legislation could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense under the indian income tax act  our operations centers in india from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues benefitted through march   from a tenyear holiday from indian corporate income taxes in respect of their export profits under the software technology parks of india stpi scheme in the absence of this tax holiday income derived from our indian operations is taxed up to the maximum tax rate generally applicable to indian enterprises which as of december   was  during the last five years we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the special economic zones act the special economic zones act introduced a year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones sezs under the special economic zones act qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to i  of their export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations ii  of such export profits for the next five years and iii  of the export profits for a further five years subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements the special economic zones act provides among other restrictions that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment beyond a prescribed limit to new sez locations we anticipate establishing additional operations centers in sezs or other tax advantaged locations in the future the direct taxes code proposed by the government of india and currently pending before the indian parliament proposes grandfathering the existing profitbased tax benefits for operations centers in sezs already receiving such tax benefits the direct taxes code also proposes discontinuing profitbased incentives for operations centers in sezs set up after march   and replaces them with investmentbased incentives for    table of contents operations centers in sezs established after that date however the bill is still pending before the parliament and owing to ensuing general elections and the fact that the parliament is not scheduled to be in sessions before the general elections there is a remote possibility that the direct taxes code will be legislated before that date accordingly we expect to continue receiving the benefit of tax deductions for our existing operations centers in sezs pursuant to the current regulations beyond the currently proposed march   sunset date if the direct taxes code is enacted into law before that date and if this grandfathering does not happen under the direct taxes code our operations centers in sezs may not receive profitbased tax benefits and our overall tax rate may increase over the next few years and that such increase may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we also benefit from a corporate tax holiday in the philippines for our operations centers established there over the last five years the tax holiday will expire for one of our centers in  and for remaining centers the tax holiday will expire over the next few years which may lead to an increase in our overall tax rate we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this annual report on form k which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain these policies include revenue recognition estimating tax liabilities stockbased compensation goodwill intangibles and longlived assets derivative instruments and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans these accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below future events may not develop exactly as forecast and estimates routinely require adjustment revenue recognition we derive our revenues from outsourcing and transformation services revenues from outsourcing services are recognized primarily on a timeandmaterial costplus or unitpriced basis revenues from transformation services are recognized primarily on a timeandmaterial fixed price or contingent fee basis the services provided within our outsourcing and transformation contracts generally contain one unit of accounting except the information technology contracts involving complex implementation services and post contract maintenance services revenues are recognized under our contracts generally when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable services have been performed and collection of amounts billed is reasonably assured revenues under timeandmaterial contracts are recognized as the services are performed revenues are recognized on costplus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreedupon profit markup such revenues are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with the client contract when the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met such as turnaround time or accuracy we monitor such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred revenues are recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client we have experienced minimal service credits and penalties to date revenues for our fixedprice transformation services contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method when the pattern of performance under the contracts can be reasonably determined we estimate the proportional performance of a contract by comparing the actual number of hours or days worked to    table of contents the estimated total number of hours or days required to complete each engagement the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed we regularly monitor our estimates for completion of a project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined if a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified revenues from software licensing arrangements which does not involve significant production modification or customization of software are recognized at the later of time of delivery or expiration of significant termination rights as long as other revenue recognition criteria mentioned above are met when there are significant production modifications or customization installation systems integration or related services the professional services and license revenues are combined as a single unit of account and maintenance services if any as a separate unit of account and the total contract fees are allocated among the two based on a residual value method revenues related to license fees and complex information technology application development services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under which the total value of revenue is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor hours to date bears to the total expected labor hours input method revenues related to maintenance services contracts whether entered into solely for providing such services or are segregated from a multipleelement contract are recognized on a straightline basis over the contract term unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern we make accruals for revenues and receivables for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date accordingly our accounts receivable include amounts for services that we have performed and for which an invoice has not yet been issued to the client these are included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet and the amounts are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets the purchase method of accounting is used for all business combinations we account for our business combinations by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest in the acquired business measured at their acquisition date fair values all assets and liabilities of the acquired business including goodwill are assigned to reporting units acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred under sga expenses we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the estimate of undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital discount rates riskfree rates market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results stockbased compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensationstock compensation asc no  cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which is generally the vesting periods determining    table of contents the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires significant judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their sharebased options we have used data on the historical exercise pattern of employees we use the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatility of stocks of our comparative companies in order to estimate future share price trends we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record stockbased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest the riskfree interest rate that we use in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zerocoupon bonds with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the options we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model if the actual forfeiture rate differs significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted derivative instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging arrangements authorized under our policies with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions our primary exchange rate exposure is with the uk pound sterling and the indian rupee we also have exposure in philippine peso czech koruna and other local currencies where we operate we use derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the underlying exposure from foreign currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and not for speculative trading purposes we hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges which are deemed effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss net of tax until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and are included in foreign exchange gainloss we also use derivatives consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gainloss we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies derivative assets and liabilities included in level  primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts the quotes are taken primarily from independent sources including highly rated financial institutions we evaluate hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis if during this time a contract is deemed ineffective the change in the fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of income and is included in foreign exchange gainloss for hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward if any deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the    table of contents years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved deferred tax assets are recognized in full subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the likelihood of realization we consider estimates of future taxable income with respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday we also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required a reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is more likely than not to occur and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated such reserves are based on estimates and consequently are subject to changing facts and circumstances including the progress of ongoing audits changes in case law and the passage of new legislation we believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover any potential additional tax assessments we generally anticipate that we will indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries accordingly we do not accrue any material income distribution or withholding taxes that would otherwise arise if such earnings were repatriated in a taxable manner we employ a twostep process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining based on the technical merits that the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon settlement our provision for income tax expense also takes into account any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits retirement benefits we provide our employees in india and the philippines with benefits under a defined benefit plan which we refer to as the gratuity plan the gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or on termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employees salary and years of employment with us we determine our liability under the gratuity plan by actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method under this method we determine our liability based upon the discounted value of salary increases until the date of separation arising from retirement death resignation or other termination of services critical assumptions used in measuring the plan expense and projected liability under the projected unit credit method include the discount rate expected return on assets and the expected increase in the compensation rates we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually if actual results differ significantly from our estimates our gratuity expense and our results of operations could be

with any tax assessment orders that have been issued or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to such assessment orders refer to

administrative agent borrowings under the credit facility may be used for    table of contents working capital and general corporate purposes originally a  million revolving facility including a letter of credit subfacility the availability under the credit facility was reduced to  million in june  upon our request and the fulfillment of certain conditions the credit facility can be increased back to  million as of december   and  we did not have any borrowings under the credit facility we anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our smaller acquisitions capital expenditures and working capital needs if we have significant growth through acquisitions we may need to obtain additional financing offbalance sheet arrangements as of december

subsidiaries were established as  exportoriented units under the software technology parks of india stpi scheme promulgated by the government of india which provides certain incentives on imported and indigenous capital goods upon the fulfillment of certain conditions although the corporate tax incentives under the stpi scheme are no longer available to us the units are required to fulfill such conditions for a limited time in the event that these units are unable to meet those conditions over the specified period we may be required to refund those incentives along with penalties and fines we believe however that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions our operations centers in the philippines are registered with the philippine economic zone authority peza the registration provides us with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and requires that exl philippines meet certain performance and investment criteria we believe that these centers have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required criteria recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements see note   recent accounting pronouncements under item  financial statements to our consolidated financial statements    table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the loss of future earnings fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to loss we manage market risk through our treasury operations our senior management and our board of directors approve our treasury operations objectives and policies the activities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures borrowing strategies if any and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies components of market risk foreign currency risk our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  in the year ended december   or uk pounds sterling  in the year ended december   a substantial portion of our expenses were incurred and paid in indian rupees and philippine peso  and  respectively in the year ended december   we also incur expenses in us dollars the czech koruna and the currencies of the other countries in which we have operations the exchange rates among the indian rupee the philippine peso uk pound sterling czech koruna and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivable and payable based upon our level of operations during the year ended december   and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period a  appreciationdepreciation in the indian rupee against the us dollar would have increaseddecreased our revenues in the year ended december   by approximately  million and our expenses incurred and paid in indian rupees by approximately  million respectively we have sought to reduce the effect of the indian rupee and the philippine peso and certain other local currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges to cover a substantial portion of our expected cash flows further a significant number of our customer contracts include protection against foreign exchange rate fluctuations which minimizes the impact of volatility in the exchange rates on our operating results cash flow hedges with notional amounts of  million were outstanding as at december   with maturity periods of one to forty fivemonths compared to  million outstanding as at december   these contracts must be settled on the day of maturity or may be cancelled subject to the receipts or payments of any gains or losses respectively equal to the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation we use these instruments for hedging our future expected cash flows and not for speculative purposes as such we may not purchase contracts adequate to insulate ourselves from indian rupee and philippine peso foreign exchange currency risks in addition any such contracts may not perform adequately as a hedging mechanism we may in the future adopt more active hedging policies and have done so in the past we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts fair value hedges to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as foreign exchange gainloss    table of contents the fair value hedging instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on the settlement of these derivatives are intended to offset revaluation losses and gains on the assets and liabilities being hedged forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of  million and gbp  million were outstanding at december   compared to  million and gbp  million outstanding at december   at december   the outstanding fair value hedging derivatives had maturities of  days or less interest rate risk as of december   we did not have any borrowings under the credit facility as such we do not have exposure to rising interest rates we have cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling  million at december   these amounts were invested principally in a shortterm investment portfolio primarily comprised of highlyrated mutual funds money market accounts and time deposits the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets working capital requirements and general corporate purposes we do not enter into these investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income a  basis points change in short term rates would impact our interest income for the year ended december   by approximately  million credit risk as of december   we have accounts receivable of  million we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties and accordingly do not require collateral credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material except a writeoff of  million during  related to receivable from one of our clients from landacorp acquisition no single client owed more than  of ar balance as on december     item  financial statements and supplementary data the financial statements required to be filed

accounting except the information technology contracts involving complex implementation services and post contract maintenance services revenues are recognized under our contracts generally when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable services have been performed and collection of amounts billed is reasonably assured revenues under timeandmaterial contracts are recognized as the services are performed revenues are recognized on costplus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreed upon profit markup such revenues are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with the client contract when the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met such as turnaround time or accuracy we monitor such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred revenues are recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client we have experienced minimal service credits and penalties to date revenue on contingent fee based contracts is recognized when the related contingency has been met to the clients satisfaction revenues for companys fixedprice transformation services contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method when the pattern of performance under the contracts can be reasonably determined we estimate the proportional performance of a contract by comparing the actual number of hours or days worked to the estimated total number of hours or days required to complete each engagement the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed we regularly monitor our estimates for completion of a project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined if a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified revenues from software licensing arrangements which does not involve significant production modification or customization of software are

advances paid towards acquisition of fixed assets and the cost of fixed assets not yet placed in service before the end of the period are classified as construction in progress fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through an assessment of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows related to such assets in the event that assets are found to be carried at amounts that are in excess of estimated undiscounted future cash flows the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets is reduced to a level commensurate with fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets depreciation and amortization on equipment held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the assets estimated useful lives or the

goodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis relying on a number of factors including operating results business plans and estimated future cash flows of the reporting units to which it is assigned recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a twostep process   f table of contents exlservice holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued december   in thousands except share and per share amounts     the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value the fair value of the reporting unit is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially valued and recognized at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its fair value which is calculated using the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of the asset the asset is considered impaired and an impairment expense is recognized equal to any shortfall in the current period the companys

which it operates the deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and all operating losses carried forward if any deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the applicable temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or tax status is recognized in the statement of income in the period in which the change is identified deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company establishes provisions for uncertain tax provisions and related interest and penalties when the company believes
