finder âºservice finder Â laboratory weighing â laboratory balances and scaleswhat is the difference between mass and weightthe words âmassâ and âweightâ are frequently used interchangeably and both are determined by weighing however in terms of laboratory balances and scales the difference between the two is key mass measures the amount of material in any given item is independent of location and remains the same no matter their environment mass is measured via comparison using a laboratory scale and balance the kilogram is the si unit of mass it is equal to the âinternational prototype kilogramâ ipk the original object from which the measurement derived an objectâs weight is how hard gravity is pulling on the mass as a force the si unit for weight is the newton   kg x ms an object with a mass of  kg weighs approximately  newtons on the surface of the earth mass multiplied by earthâs gravity the weight of an object on a mountain will be less than at sea level due to gravitational variations  a high accuracy balance or laboratory scale will detect such differences the redefinition of the kilogram is scheduled for  supporting redefinition of the kilogram offers further reading about the change although mass and weight are different entities the process of determining both weight and mass is called weighingÂ how do electronic balances work what is the electromagnetic force compensation principlewith mechanical balances a sample is placed on one end of the beam reference weights on the other until it is perfectly balanced the sum value of the weights representing the mass of the sample electronic precision balances analytical balances and microbalances in high accuracy classes work with a sensor based on electromagnetic force compensation a coil on a free movable beam is inserted in a permanent magnetic field an optical electronic sensor current maintains its position controlled to an accuracy greater than one thousandth of a millimetre the sensor records vertical position changes when the pan is loaded which is used to change the current in the coil to return to its initial position the more weight is added to the pan the more current is needed to compensate it this is digitized on the displayÂ laboratory balances and readabilitiescommon laboratory balances and scales types are ultramicro micro semimicro analytical and precision balances the readability of a balance is the smallest difference between two measured values that can be read on the display with a digital display this is the smallest numerical increment also called the scale interval the readability of a balance is not equivalent to its weighing accuracy several properties may limit performance the most important are repeatability rp eccentricity ec nonlinearity nl and sensitivity seour laboratory balances and scales video course basics and weighing influences explains basic concepts of good weighing practiceÂ how to select the right laboratory balance or laboratory scalefor accurate measuring considerrequired weighing accuracy  sets the upper limit to the allowable measurement uncertainty of the balance to ensure process tolerances eg safety factor  ensures that even with changes over time the required weighing accuracy is still keptrequired smallest net weight to be weighed  specifies the minimum weight the laboratory scale must achieve according to measurement uncertainty andor customer process toleranceslargest weight to be weighed including tare  specifies the capacity of the lab scaleenvironmental conditions and weighing application  specifies further properties of the laboratory balances and scalesmake sure that you select a lab balance or laboratory scale that meets your process requirements and respective tolerances good weighing practiceâ¢ gwpÂ® is a universal approach to selecting and testing weighing instruments a global standard it can be used in any industrial and working area for new or existing weighing systems gwpÂ® provides documented evidence for reproducible weighing results in accordance with all current quality standards offering reliable product quality and regulatory compliance gwpÂ® is a benchmark for laboratory balances and scales and uses two key issues to determine qualitythe weighing capacity must be larger than the largest gross load expected to be weighed by the userthe minimum weight of the weighing instrument for the accuracy required  including the safety factor  must be smaller than the smallest sample expected to be weighed by the userÂ what is the resolution of a laboratory weighing instrumentthe resolution is the degree to which change can be detected usually expressed as a number of points it is the capacity in g divided by the readability in g an analytical balance or scale with a capacity of  g and a readability of  g has a resolution of  million points mettler toledoâs highest resolution comparator is the m mass comparator with  billion pointsÂ which tolerances are applicable in weighing processestolerances determine whether a lab balance or lab scale behaves well enough to meet process requirements and how much deviation is permittable tolerances set the criteria to issue a passfail statement tolerances come from a variety of sources including legal agencies manufacturing industries and the process itselflegal toleranceslegal tolerances stipulated by oiml r or nist handbook  us only assess legal for trade requirements these tolerances are quite large and easily met with laboratory balances or when weighing at the lower end of the measurement rangemanufacturer tolerancesmanufacturer tolerances ensure that equipment meets manufacturer specifications manufacturer tolerances do not consider user specific process requirements and are unsuitable for improving the weighing processprocess tolerances specific process tolerances defined by the user support process improvements and savings on material waste and rework for laboratory scales in a legal for trade application process tolerances should be applied in addition to legal tolerances for more details on mettler toledos gwp verificationÂ® visit good
