to condensed consolidated financial statements   note   the company history and nature of the business    nukkleus inc formerly compliance  risk management solutions inc the “company” was formed on july   in the state of delaware as a forprofit company and established a fiscal year end of september    on february   john nettlefold closed a transaction in which he purchased a total of  shares of restricted stock of the company representing  of the shares in the company from mountain laurel holdings at the same time mr christopher neuert the former director resigned his position at that time and the shareholders of the company elected mr nettlefold as director of the company   subsequent to the change in control on february   the new director john nettlefold decided to transition the company from business technology to advertising technology to this effect on may   mr nettlefold undertook a merger between nukkleus inc a nevada entity and compliance risk  management solutions inc a delaware entity  former name of this company   on july   the state of delaware approved an amendment of the articles to increase the authorized shares of the company to  on july   the state of delaware approved the forward stock split at the ratio of  finra gave final approval for this forward stock split name change and ticker symbol change from crmv to the current nukk on july     by late july management had decided that many of the underlying factors of mr nettlefold’s business would not be feasible as presented as such on july   the previous merger agreement was rescinded   on july   charms investments inc closed a transaction in which it acquired the majority restricted block from the director john nettlefold representing  of the company’s shares as seen on the k filed july     on august   mr nettlefold resigned as director of the company and on the same day the majority of the shareholders elected mr peter maddocks as director of the company  since this transition the company has been conducting due diligence and reviewing several possibilities within the technology arena   on february   charms investments ltd a nonaffiliated company sold  shares of common stock to currency mountain holdings bermuda limited “cmh” the parent of the company cmh is whollyowned by an entity that is owned by the company’s sole officer and director in addition on the same date cmh acquired  shares of common stock from another nonaffiliated company    the aggregate purchase price paid by cmh was     on may   the company acquired selected technology assets from cmh as the acquisition was from an entity under common control the company recorded these assets at cmh’s carrying values which were zero   on may   the company obtained a  shareholder stake in ibih limited parent company of ironfx global group ironfx and acquired  of the issued and outstanding shares of gvs limited a bvi corporation a former subsidiary of ibih limited in addition the company entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to acquire the remaining equity in ibih limited and prior to such closing the company is required to enter into an option agreement to acquire fml malta ltd and fxdd trading limited operating units which are affiliates through common ownership these transactions are subject to regulatory approval where applicable see note    on june   the company agreed to sell to cmh  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock for  in two equal installments the first close occurred on june   the second close will occur with the closing of the company’s acquisition of ibih   the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable for a going concern which assumes that the company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business   since inception the company has incurred net losses of  and has a working capital of  at june     our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the management of expenses and ability of the company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due and upon profitable operations   we need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings  however we cannot be certain that such capital from our stockholders or third parties will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us   any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact our business if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms we will have insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth   note   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation   the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” for interim financial information and with rule  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements the balance sheet at september   was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   the other information in these condensed consolidated financial statements is unaudited but in the opinion of management reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered  these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and additional information as contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended september     f         cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  there were no cash equivalents at june   and september     loss per common share   basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive  there were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the period ended june     revenue recognition   prior to february   the company derived its revenue from the sale of general compliance and risk management consulting services professional services revenue   the company utilizes written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions of services sold to customers   because the company provides its applications as services it follows the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin “sab” no   revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met   ● there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ● the service has been provided to the customer ● the collection of the fees is reasonably assured and ● the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable   the company records revenues and expenses related to the global service agreements at gross as the company is deemed to be a principal in the transactions revenues are recognized when the services are completed and expenses are recognized as incurred   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to fasb asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes the deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences   the company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets the company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the company’s financial position and results of operations for the current period future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the federal tax laws  changes in circumstances such as the company generating taxable income could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate   fair value of financial instruments   the company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using the available market information and valuation methods considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value accordingly the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange as of june   the carrying value of accrued taxes accrued liabilities and due todue from affiliates approximated fair value due to the shortterm nature and maturity of these instruments   f         estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of june    actual results could differ from those estimates made by management   recently issued accounting pronouncements   asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ”  the objective of asu  is to require an entity to recognize the amount of revenue which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers  asu  will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap when it becomes effective  the amendments become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period  early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period  the standard allows an entity to apply the amendments in asu  using either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method  the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements   asu  “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” this asu requires management to determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding the entity’s going concern presumption which generally refers to an entity’s ability to meet its obligations as they become due if substantial doubt exists certain disclosures are required as such management will now have primary responsibility for the going concern assessment under us gaap to date this responsibility has rested principally with the independent auditor the amendments in asu  apply to all entities unless they have adopted the liquidation basis of accounting under subtopic  the new standard applies prospectively to annual periods ending after december   and to interim and annual periods thereafter early application is permitted the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements   asu  “income statement–extraordinary and unusual items subtopic  simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items ” the fasb believes that eliminating the concept of extraordinary items from us gaap will save time and reduce costs for financial statement preparers and will alleviate uncertainty for preparers auditors and regulators because auditors and regulators no longer will need to evaluate whether a preparer presented an unusual andor infrequent item appropriately the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence has been retained and has been expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence the nature and financial effects of each event or transaction is required to be presented as a separate component of income from continuing operations or alternatively in the notes to the financial statements the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   a reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively a reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements the company has implemented this pronouncement   asu  “financial instruments—overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” this new guidance makes targeted improvements to existing us gaap by i requiring equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income ii requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes iii requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset that is securities or loans and receivables on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements iv eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities v eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet and vi requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk also referred to as “own credit” when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements   f         asu  “leases topic ” under this new guidance a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than  months consistent with current us gaap the recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease however unlike current us gaap which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new asu will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the asu also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases these disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements the asu will take effect for public companies for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements   asu  “financial instrumentscredit losses topic  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” this new guidance will require the earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use under the new guidance an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the expected loss model will apply to loans and leases unfunded lending commitments heldtomaturity debt securities and other debt instruments measured at amortized cost the impairment model for availableforsale debt securities will require the recognition of credit losses through a valuation allowance when fair value is less than amortized cost regardless of whether the impairment is considered to be otherthantemporary the new guidance is effective on january   with early adoption permitted on january   the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements   management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standard if

expenses and ability of the company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due and upon profitable operations   the company either needs to borrow funds or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings  however it cannot be certain that such capital from its stockholders or third parties will be available or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant

company’s management to maintain the separate brand identity operational autonomy and segregated customer deposits for each individual retail forex brand it may potentially acquire in the future while simultaneously capitalizing on efficiencies afforded by scale shared backbones and optimized regulatory capital structure   as a result of these above described transactions which were entered in may  as well as further contemplated transactions the company’s goal is to create an industry leading sector consolidated platform combining strong global retail and institutional trading flows covering fx commodities futures cfd and equities with a cutting edge technological product suite turnkey software and technological development capabilities these contemplated transactions could potentially result in a global financial trading and financial technology group with operations and clients as well as one of the most comprehensive regulatory licenses coverage in the world   the company agreed to acquire the remaining  shares of ibih for  shares of its common stock subject to ibih obtaining regulatory approvals from the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom and from the

the cyprus regulatory authority “cysec” granted all regulatory approvals for the transaction with nukkleus to be consummated thereafter additional submissions were made to the london fca to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the spa then in december of  the parties agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the london fca and will be amending the spa to reflect that no regulatory approval would be needed to complete the second closing based on further contemplated changes to the transaction structure the amended spa will also reflect that

of this evaluation we concluded that our financial reporting controls and procedures were not effective for the period ended december   due to its small size and limited financial resources the company has only one employee involved in accounting and financial reporting as a result there is no segregation of duties within the accounting function leaving all aspects of financial control and physical control of cash in the hands of the same employee in addition our deficiencies also include a lack of timely financial statement preparation and account reconciliations as well as and as a result of limited financial resources the ability to retain personnel with sufficient technical expertise regarding accounting for certain equitybased transactions the ceo is currently working to retain a fulltime cfo and to put it in place adequate levels of controls to provide for greater segregation of duties there is no cfo at this time however and the ceo is also acting in the capacity of chief accounting officer   b changes in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting   other than described above there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over
