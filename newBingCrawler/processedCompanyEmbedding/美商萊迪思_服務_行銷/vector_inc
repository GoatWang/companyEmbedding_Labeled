cross product from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the cross product of two vectors in threedimensional euclidean space for other uses see cross product disambiguation in mathematics and vector algebra the cross product or vector product occasionally directed area product to emphasize the geometric significance is a binary operation on two vectors in threedimensional space r and is denoted by the symbol × given two linearly independent vectors a and b the cross product a × b is a vector that is perpendicular to both a and b and thus normal to the plane containing them it has many applications in mathematics physics engineering and computer programming it should not be confused with dot product projection product if two vectors have the same direction or have the exact opposite direction from one another ie are not linearly independent or if either one has zero length then their cross product is zero more generally the magnitude of the product equals the area of a parallelogram with the vectors for sides in particular the magnitude of the product of two perpendicular vectors is the product of their lengths the cross product is anticommutative ie a × b  −b × a and is distributive over addition ie a × b  c  a × b  a × c the space r together with the cross product is an algebra over the real numbers which is neither commutative nor associative but is a lie algebra with the cross product being the lie bracket like the dot product it depends on the metric of euclidean space but unlike the dot product it also depends on a choice of orientation or handedness the product can be generalized in various ways it can be made independent of orientation by changing the result to pseudovector or in arbitrary dimensions the exterior product of vectors can be used with a bivector or twoform result also using the orientation and metric structure just as for the traditional dimensional cross product one can in n dimensions take the product of n −  vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to nontrivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensions if one adds the further requirement that the product be uniquely defined then only the dimensional cross product qualifies see § generalizations below for other dimensions

references  external links definitionedit finding the direction of the cross product by the righthand rule the cross product of two vectors a and b is defined only in threedimensional space and is denoted by a × b in physics sometimes the notation a ∧ b is used though this is avoided in mathematics to avoid confusion with the exterior product the cross product a × b is defined as a vector c that is perpendicular to both a and b with a direction given by the righthand rule and a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram that the vectors span the cross product is defined by the formula a × b  ∥ a ∥ ∥ b ∥ sin ⁡  θ    n  for real matrices dyadics have a dot product and double dot product defined on them see dyadics product of dyadic and dyadic for their definitions tensorsedit
