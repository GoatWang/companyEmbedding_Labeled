assessment committed to sustainable development cpf is aware of economic social and environmental challenges to strengthen our business to become the leading food manufacturer cpf’s product sustainability was thus established by applying life cycle assessment to our supply chain farm to fork to design and develop production processes achieving the cpf green value chain consumers can be assured that our products are high in quality and safety while being traceable in addition the consumers play significant roles in promoting efficient use of resources leading to sustainable consumption for the future generations the success of cpf’s product sustainability is that our fresh and cooked chicken products have been certified to prosustain standard by dnv gl the global leader

society in addition turning waste into energy used for production processes a circular business model  is suitable for securing the energy resource therefore waste associated with and obtained from our food supply chain is recovered for examples agricultural waste purchased from farmers is converted to biomass energy to produce steam for process of manufacturing animal feed animal manure from farms is utilized as fertilizer for growing crops wastewater from farms and food processing plants is subjected to treatments to generate biogas an alternative fuel air pollution is then decreased while only treated wastewater is discharged to river consumers’ health is our main safety concern therefore highquality fresh vegetable oil is only used for frying in addition used frying oil is then reprocessed to biodiesel fuel used for transportation cpf is strongly determined to convey a value of product sustainability to consumers all over the world it is relatively a journey with endless processes of designing and developing sustainable products it is also involved in recent social issues on efficient use of resources and environment for the sustainable growth sustainability cpf and
