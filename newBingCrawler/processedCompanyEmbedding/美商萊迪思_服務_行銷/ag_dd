january  abstract nanoparticles of ag au pd and cu have been prepared by the reduction of their salts by ethyl alcohol under refluxing conditions in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp in the case of au and cu it was necessary to use magnesium metal as a catalyst during the reduction the nanoparticles are in the – nm range in the case of ag au and pd but there is considerable agglomeration
