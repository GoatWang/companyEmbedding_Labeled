provides mobile marketing solutions enabling mnos to retain and acquire market share increase average revenue per user arpu and reducing subscriber churn the companys products and services deliver fully managed solutions utilizing advanced data analytics techniques combined with linguistic engineering marketing to build awareness and multiply sales and optins of promotional offerings and other mobile content being offered by the mnos the solutions designed by the company are tailored and served with the appropriate linguistic format to each individual mobile network subscriber typology and geography it operates in using its proprietary software and scalable infrastructure the majority of cdialogues revenues are derived from a recurring subscriptionbased revenue model which has been pioneered by the company as a result the company benefits from incremental cash flow growth from each new campaign customer and mobile network subscriber the companys nearterm focus is on growing both its customer base and expanding its geographic footprint in selected markets in the middle east africa and southeast asia where mobile device penetration and mobile network usage is growing rapidly     chairmans statement the month period to  december  was clearly a challenging one the period was therefore one of consolidation for the company as we focused on delivery of existing contracts across geographies where mno subscriber churn has traditionally been high due to the fact that mobile phone subscribers typically use prepay mobile phone tariffs a decision was also made to focus on further product development during the period and whilst certain project launches were delayed the company remains confident that its product offerings remain competitive in the marketplace given the disappointing revenue performance we are able to report that the company has continued to generate cash during the year and maintain a strong balance sheet as of  december  reassuringly our solutions achieved direct results for our existing clients by demonstrably reducing subscriber churn which helps to underpin the basis of our client relationships we believe that our continued product investment will result in an improved value proposition which should also result in further customer loyalty and a reference point for us to generate new business and relationships our first full year on the alternative investment market has been challenging and we must continue to improve the foundations of the business model the key to the future is the development of stable new revenue opportunities the number of mnos and countries in which we could operate means that there are still plenty of opportunities ahead the board remains focused on improving the business model whilst preserving the balance sheet and seeking to deliver increased shareholder value following a disappointing share price performance over the period   mark horrocks nonexecutive chairman         chief executive officer review when we joined the aim market in  the focus was on diversifying revenue through multiple client engagements across the middle east and beyond as such we invested in both products and personnel to ensure that we are well placed to take advantage of the growing range of global opportunities however as announced during the period the company suffered a number of project delays as mnos pushed back project start dates due to the poor economic environment during  this impacted our second half revenue performance significantly and resulted in lower revenues and ebitda for the year notwithstanding the poor income performance cash generation remained strong during the year with free cash flow for the year further enhancing the companys net cash position to € million at  december   € million during  cdialogues delivered a total of eight mobile marketing projects in six countries to a total subscriber base of above  million customers   million across the middle east and southeast asia these projects attracted more than  million unique subscribers our continued investment on the evolution of our solutions and strategic direction towards a loyalty centric offering has already resulted in an increased interest on our value proposition from potential customers further to the companys prior announcement it is unfortunate to report that our initial customer in central america for this proposition faced different challenges on integration that could not be resolved i would like to thank our staff and shareholders for their continued support during  as we consolidated our position as one of the leading providers in the space   outlook despite the challenging environment and poor financial performance we continued to invest in the business whilst maintaining our strong balance sheet and therefore remain well positioned to capitalise on any new opportunities in the regions where we have presence or active business development activities given that net contributions from some mature projects are expected to decrease during  the company is now focused on building the new business pipeline while maintaining cash generation to preserve our balance sheet during this challenging period for the company     pale spanos chief executive officer   chief financial officer review revenues for the period fell  to €m  €m due to weaker performance in the second half of year from the existing projects and the lack of new project launches gross profit was down by  to €m  €m representing a gross margin of    the reduction in gross

a result of efficient working capital management after taking into account working capital movements and cash flows used in investing activities which comprise primarily capitalised investment in software development free cash flow after development costs and capital expenditure was €m  €m at the yearend we had accrued income of €m and related accrued expenses of €m which represents income earned during the last months of  and its associated costs which has already been invoiced and collectedsettled since the year end net cash as of  december  was €m  €m and provides a firm foundation for further growth into new territories as at  march  net cash was above €m as a result of the groups continuing focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet  this should allow the group to capitalise

the mobile network operators on either a prepaid or postpaid basis the groups technical infrastructure is connected directly with mobile network operators in the territories in which it operates and in most cases transacts with its business partners through revenue sharing arrangements under which the net revenues generated from the relevant mobile marketing initiatives are divided in several cases those mobile marketing initiatives are devised in cooperation with the operators themselves in other instances campaigns are instigated by the group and may be rolled out concurrently across several mobile operator networks and in a number of different countries more specifically through the use of its mobile analytics and linguistic engineering platform the group tries to attract as many mobile subscribers to participate in any given service and then seeks to engage and maintain them within the service with relevant content offering and reward programs to attract potential mobile

for the group to design the appropriate loyalty building programs and reward schemes the ongoing management of mobile marketing solutions provides the group with a growing database of behavioral and customer engagement analytics the knowledge and experience on monetization of those data provides important feedback for the groups future performance and is also reflected in continuous expansion to

business accounted for  per cent of the total revenues during  as a whole notwithstanding the boards expectation that revenues from existing projects will decline during the course of  the groups subscriptionbased recurring revenues are viewed as a key element of the business model the group has identified a pipeline of potential new contracts a number of which are being actively developed as prospects     ·      principal risks and uncertainties facing the business in addition to the financial risks discussed in note  to the accounts the directors set out below the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group and a summary of the key measures taken to mitigate those risks   contract duration and nonrenewal of contracts the group enters into contracts with its customers which are typically short term in nature threefour months but are normally renewed at the end of each term though this cannot be guaranteed  the board seeks to ensure that the groups relationships with its customers and level of service minimises the risk of contracts not being renewed   concentration of customer base the group is a relatively young business and has not yet achieved a diverse customer base however cdialogues has been continually seeking to reduce customer concentration and will continue this aim for    credit risk the group provides services and receives revenues under agreements entered into with a local partner in the territories in which it provides services  whilst the group endeavours to diversify its sources of revenue it is reliant on this relationship which may result in a greater level of credit risk than if the group was contracted directly with the mnos  however such credit risk has not affected the business adversely in the past and the group manages this risk by negotiating and enforcing appropriate contract terms   countries in which cdialogues operates cdialogues operates in countries where there may be risks associated with the political or economic environment  the group seeks to mitigate these risks by i undertaking its own risk analysis of each territory in which it operates and ii operating with local partners with detailed knowledge of the prevailing environment   attracting and retaining talented staff and motivating key people the group has competitive remuneration packages in place to secure the services of talented staff and key employees   significant failure or interruption to the network or it systems the group has rigorous controls to maintain and secure its operations including multisite back up of key systems in addition the group implements a standardised disaster recovery plan   failure to keep up to date with fast evolving technology the group is constantly developing its software platform ensuring it is evolving in line with the latest technology and in line with its clients expectations and demands management regularly communicates with the companys clients ensuring the mobile marketing campaigns are meeting their needs   failure to comply with local laws and regulations management mitigate this risk by assessing the regulatory environment and legal system before entering a new market the group also implements a strong code of conduct across all of its operations in addition to the principal risks and uncertainties above the group faces other risks that include but are not limited to ·      increased competition ·      failure to retain or loss of customer contracts    corporate responsibility cdialogues plc takes its responsibilities as a corporate citizen seriously in the territories in which the company operates the boards primary goal is to create shareholder value but in a responsible way which serves all stakeholders furthermore cdialogues seeks to continually enhance and extend its contribution to society through the work the group undertakes with its clients and in areas where the group decides to operate   governance the board considers sound governance as a critical component of the success of cdialogues and this is given the highest priority the group has an effective and engaged board with a strong nonexecutive presence from diverse backgrounds and wellfunctioning governance committees the audit committee receives and reviews reports from management and from the companys auditors it is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the group is properly reported with particular regard to legal requirements accounting standards and the aim rules through the groups compensation policies and variable components of employee remuneration the remuneration committee of the board seeks to ensure that the companys values are reinforced in employee behaviour and that effective risk management is promoted   going concern  the group meets its day to day working capital requirements through existing cash reserves the directors have prepared projected cash flow information for a period of at least twelve months from the date of their approval of the financial statements  on the basis of this cash flow information the directors consider that the company and group will continue to operate without the need for additional financing  therefore the directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis current trading given that net contributions from some mature projects are expected to decrease during  the company is now focused on building the new business pipeline while maintaining cash generation to preserve our balance sheet during this challenging period for the

is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee specifically the group controls an investee if and only if the group has ·    power over the investee ie existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee ·    exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ·    the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns   generally there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control to support this presumption and when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee the group considers all relevant facts and circumstances
