the  year longterm investment strategy commenced  the group has diversified into new markets and expanded its services portfolio   during  steady progress was achieved with the groups transition plan which will deliver a stable platform for future growth limit the business exposure to single marketscustomers and widen the portfolio of services to include key differentiators across our propositions   in  new customers and projects were added across all the groups markets with a mix of legacy and new services although these projects may not be of high financial value they are of significant strategic value in that they open up new key accounts and also lower norcons dependency on certain marketscustomers   the directors believe the business is now positioned on a much stronger platform to achieve future growth across all the groups markets       financial highlights trading has been consistent with the directors expectations for the year   ·      revenue of usm fy  usm ·

proved to be another challenging year for norcon however last year i expressed confidence that we were well placed to start seeing the results of our transition strategy into an expanding marketplace and i am pleased to report that this has been the case   furthermore i am pleased to report that our historical reliance on one major client in saudi arabia has been further reduced with our changing geographical distribution new markets in the us and europe now account for more than  of our turnover and our presence in asia is growing   our focus as a company and as a board is to return norcon to profitability and our efforts to grow our business will remain our key priority going forward looking into the expanding marketplace we serve i am confident of success  will see the company continuing

confidence that we were well placed to start seeing the results of our transition strategy into an expanding marketplace and i am pleased to report that this has been the case   we have continued to make additional investment in both personnel and new markets and this has resulted in our ebitda being positive and the group reporting a small loss before taxes by developing a more sophisticated product mix to better position our offering in the value chain we are beginning to get real traction although clearly it takes time to penetrate new customers and geographical markets   i am pleased to report that our historical reliance on one major client in saudi arabia has been further reduced with our changing geographical distribution new markets in the us and europe now account for more than  of our turnover and our presence in asia is growing   as communications play an ever important role the corresponding need for new technologies to expand existing capacity and widen product and
