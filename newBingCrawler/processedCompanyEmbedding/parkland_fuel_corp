national footprint to more than  gas stations or roughly  percent of the canadian retail fuel market in addition the deal includes  pioneerbranded and  essobranded gas stations many of which are in prime urban locations we have long recognized the ontario retail marketplace as a critical growth opportunity for parkland aligning with parklands overarching supply strategy we also recognize pioneer energy as one of canadas most respected independent retail fuel marketers having built pioneer into the strongest independent retail fuel brand in ontario given the pioneer groups sophisticated understanding of the retail fuel industry their investment in parkland is a strong endorsement of our strategy and we look forward to welcoming their team said bob espey president and ceo of parkland pioneer distributes more than  billion liters of fuel annually through its  gas stations and a recently acquired commercial operation in ontario new brunswick and nova scotia pioneer currently

ebitda through acquisitions and their associated synergies and  million from the give me five initiative since  with the pioneer acquisition parkland is expected to attain its goal to add  million in additional adjusted ebitda by  a full year earlier than expected our fiveyear growth plan has progressed rapidly as a result of our teams ability to identify and execute disciplined transactions we

of fuel as a strategic necessity by anthony a davis august   for years jack donald walked around with a mutilated penny in his pocket in  with his wife joan the wily former mechanic and petroleum hall of famer bought the controlling share of parkland beef industries a head cattle feedlot in lacombe alberta the donalds veering from bovines to fuel soon after created the beginnings of what is now parkland fuel corp known now for its greenandgold fas gas plus stations and related short stop convenience stores sprinkled across western canada donald now  and still running his own property company was president and ceo of parkland fuel corp from  to  he had hacksawed a onequartersized wedge out of that penny the remaining disc of copper left behind was his symbolic peacemaker with consumers rankled by the high price of g asoline at the time he took that coin to service clubs and other meetings around alberta explaining that the remaining threequarters of a cent represented the puny profit parkland headquartered in red deer was making on each liter of gas it sold then at the time says donald canadian consumers were complaining fuel distributors “were ripping them off” complaints about fuel prices haven’t changed much since but parkland now the country’s largest independent fuel distributor and marketer with a market cap of  billion certainly has the penny that jack donald left used to illustrate parkland fuel’s tight margins helped inspire ceo bob espey’s penny plan for the company photographs bryce meyer regardless of what miffed motorists were saying then and still say today margins on the retail end of the oil business – the service stations and bulk fuel distributors who supply trucking fleets and the like – have always been notoriously slim today though it ranges between six and eight cents per liter for gasoline and few industries compete as fiercely for such narrow profits says parkland’s current ceo bob espey “retail fuel is probably one of the most competitive markets because you have full price transparency” he says “where else do you drive down the street and see the price of a product multiple times during the day” while not yet as obvious in canada as elsewhere in the world integrated oil companies – behemoths like royal dutch shell and exxonmobil – have been rapidly closing or divesting themselves of their gas stations the days where the major oil companies had wellhead to gas tank vertical integration are coming to an end for the majors the big money is in the upstream finding and producing oil and gas and midstream refining end of the oil business retail is profitwise a poor cousin and a headache in  there were more than  pumps across canada at the end of  there were  according to mj ervin  associates shell canada ltd recently sold all of its service stations and convenience store operations east of montreal for example just  per cent of canada’s gas stations are directly pricecontrolled by major oil companies a two per cent drop from three years ago retailing fuel has never been a core competency of big oil now they are getting out explains michael ervin president of the calgarybased consultancy “because integrated oil companies no longer see the marketing of fuel as a strategic necessity they used to see it as a necessity when refineries were operating at far less than their optimal or full capacities in that kind of operating environment having a builtin integrated marketing asset was providing an assured market for a lot of refinery production that is no longer the case because refineries are operating at close to  per cent capacity” “where else do you drive down the street and see the price of a product multiple times during the day” though not particularly well known as a corporate entity parkland with  employees around the country has excelled at competing in this niche growing into canada’s largest independent fuel distributor and marketer according to its  annual report  billion liters of fuel were sold in canada last year parkland captured  per cent of that market last year through the  fas gas race trac and esso stations it now either owns or are dealeroperated around the country parkland industries renamed as parkland fuel corp at the end of  pumped  billion liters of gasoline into motorists’ vehicles add the  billion liters of mostly diesel parkland pumped into trucks and fleets through cardlocks and bulk fuel delivery another  billion in home heating oil propane and other fuels supplied around the country and parkland supplied canadians with  billion liters of liquid energy that earned the company  million in gross profits on  billion in operating revenue in  it paid out  million in dividends to investors a  per cent increase over the previous year parkland has been impressing analysts with its highoctane performance calling its q results “a big beat” on his forecasts cibc world markets analyst kevin chiang praised parkland for its welldisciplined and welltimed growth strategy which has only accelerated as of late parkland has been seizing on a trend the big boys are getting out of the service station business photograph bryce meyer espey is a former naval officer with an mba from the ivey school of business who took over as parkland’s ceo two years ago he calls the downstream end of the oil business parkland’s “sandbox” it’s a place where parkland plays better than the big kids in the oil business who have by and large decided there are better places to deploy their capital than gas stations another thing about the major oil companies adds espey is “the more they have to do detailed things with customers the less that fits within their operating model so that’s where we can come in we can take it over it’s our space” parkland says espey wants to be big oil’s distributor of choice when it comes to selling their end products gasoline diesel bulk fuels propane and lubricants to that end says the cibc’s chiang parkland has been busy buying up retail outlets and other fuel distribution channels around the country “they have been a leader to consolidate this market and despite what every company says that they are disciplined in acquisitions and that they don’t want to pay too much i would argue that parkland has been quite successful in being disciplined around its acquisition strategy” unlike branded dealerowned service stations think shell petrocanada and chevron stations who have to buy their fuel at fixed prices from a single supplier parkland is free to shop around and look for the best deals though it also now owns  esso stations and supplies another  esso dealers parkland buys fuel for them and its other holdings from every refiner in the country it gives parkland negotiating power with suppliers like suncor exxon and shell retailing fuel has never been a core competency of big oil now they are getting out with its growing infrastructure he adds parkland can solve refiners’ distribution issues better than other independent fuel marketers it’s one of the only independents with its own storage terminals and thanks to the million purchase last december of elbow river marketing limited it has a fleet of  rail cars some now being used to bypass the bottleneck in pipelines and ship crude for oil sands refiners and extending parkland’s supply capability in north america well capitalized and continuing to grow its brands gas stations aren’t parkland’s only channels of distribution aside from the familiar retail channel the fas gas race trac esso and some other lesser known branded stations such as cango and sunys in the east parkland has a bulkfuel channel it supplies homeheating fuels propane and primarily diesel to cardlock type trucking operations fleets and even ships on the west coast through  commercial locations parkland is shell’s largest distributor of branded diesel in canada and the largest distributor of shellbranded lubricants in north america parkland also has a wholesale channel supplying  other independent dealers with diesel gasoline propane home heating oil and other products on may  parkland made its first foray into quebec assuming the customers and assets of transmontaigne marketing canada inc from financial services giant morgan stanley that enhanced parkland’s strategic supply infrastructure in central canada says espey “we like to say our objective is to have a material supply advantage over any other independent in the marketplace” parkland also has an advantage over other independents in that it supplies diesel and gasoline products rather than just one or the other the bigbox retailers with stations such as costco and safeway focus on gas a large independent like ufa with mainly agricultural customers focuses on diesel “we come in and we have a very balanced barrel and refiners like to produce both” espey says last year espey unveiled a fiveyear growth strategy called the penny plan which if successful would increase parkland’s fuel sales to seven billion liters of fuel a year and capture  per cent of the canadian market by  it would also through improved operational efficiencies and increased economies of scale save parkland one cent per liter in costs that could create  million in savings if parkland reaches its sales goal in three years still running through the company is the ethos of jack donald who pulled parkland into the fuel business and built it into a major company with only a high school degree his mechanics certificate and the kind of hardearned experience that got a lot of oil under his fingernails now as parkland penetrates even more markets throughout the country donald looks at the company and says “i am very proud of it it turned out very well” parkland has merely been scaling up a strategy started by donald who built up the company and its fas gas brand both organically by building new stations but also by buying up small independent stations and converting them over to parkland brands “we are known in the industry in canada as the goto guys if you want to sell your business so we do get unsolicited requests” espey says “ultimately everything is for sale” what’s in a name photograph bryce meyer the first fas gas station was established in red deer in  when a small station jack donald bought through his own private company two years earlier was traded to what was then called parkland industries ltd in exchange for shares donald got the fas gas name while on holidays in texas and from his motel room balcony saw an abandoned gas station with the name on it liking the name and finding it wasn’t registered in canada when he got back he copyrighted it in those early days in red deer when other stations closed at  pm fas gas stayed open until  pm in its constant search for an edge fas gas taking on municipal fire commissioners that argued it would be dangerous had the first selfservice pumps in alberta it also had the first keylock pumps more posts
