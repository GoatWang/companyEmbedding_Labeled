 for more information about acv and acvc see key metric definitions below management discussion onvias goal is to become the leading commerce intelligence system at the center of the businesstogovernment or bg marketplace we believe that by building trusted connections between businesses and governments we can make this extremely large yet fragmented market more effective and efficient to create these trusted connections we have established three objectives upon which we focus our efforts increase our content coverage to become the authority in bg commerce intelligence and analysis  leverage our proprietary technology including industry ontologies business rules and search capabilities to consistently deliver highly targeted proprietary data develop workflow tools and integrations to help businesses efficiently qualify and pursue revenue opportunities and to help agencies procure more effectively in  we made good progress against these three goals first we successfully launched onvia exchange which provides participating agencies with the data they need to connect with vendors and improve their procurement process we are pleased with the level of agency adoption to date and participating agencies should begin to provide new and unique procurement content to onvia exchange later this year further expanding onvias already robust content coverage this expanded content coverage will allow us to further enhance the insight and analysis we provide to the bg market second all onvia clients were migrated to onvia s tagbased search paradigm which organizes procurement data using advanced data science ontologies and machine learning to provide more accurate and targeted insights to our clients in addition onvia  automates a large part of the data curation process which provides the capacity to efficiently process significantly larger content volumes finally we improved our workflow enablement tools to help clients maximize the value of our information we released data integration into two leading crm systems in  salesforce and microsoft dynamics and made significant progress on our onvia  workflow release scheduled throughout   in january  we announced that russ mann joined onvia as president and chief executive officer effective january th russ has a strong background in accelerating top line revenue growth innovating market changing products and creating value for shareholders  i have been working as part of the onvia team for nearly a month and i am more excited than ever about our opportunity to dynamically change the bg marketplace stated mr mann we have the right team in place an extremely loyal client base proprietary technologies and a robust database of procurement content our foundation is extremely strong from which to innovate new solutions reduce friction in the procurement process and create value for governments businesses shareholders and society at large we will discuss any new strategic goals for  and beyond at a later date fourth quarter and annual  results subscription revenue for the quarter ended december   grew  to  million compared to the same period in  throughout  we made significant investments in product development and content marketing programs to accelerate revenue growth and create leverage from our business model these investments began to contribute to revenue growth in the second half of  for the year ended december  subscription revenue grew  over  acv for strategic accounts grew  million or  in the fourth quarter of  over the same period last year the growth in acv primarily reflects improved results in acquisition sales as a result of improved sales execution and content marketing programs small business legacy accounts represents clients outside of our strategic target market that have been subscribers since before  when we originally transitioned away from the small business market total acv grew  in q  compared to the same period in the prior year for the twelve months ended december   dollar retention was  compared to  in the same period last year dollar retention is a measurement of how effectively the client success team has retained achieved price increases and expanded existing subscription contracts this measurement can fluctuate from period to period due to the mix of first year and tenured clients expiring in each period as well as the volume of pricing and contract expansions in a particular for more information about dollar retention see key metric definitions below operating expenses in the fourth quarter of  increased  to  million from  million in the same period of  the increase in comparative periods is primarily due to investments in our product team to support onvia  and onvia exchange and in leadership roles in sales and marketing and due to accelerated amortization of internal software costs of  explained further below in addition general and administrative costs associated with our ceo transition of approximately  were incurred in the fourth quarter of    operating expenses increased  or  million to  million compared to  million in  due to the growth related initiatives in sales marketing and product development discussed above  expenses also include the acceleration of internal use software amortization of  and ceo transition costs of   we expect to incur additional transition costs in the first half of  our current product roadmap is focused on improving client workflows and the usability of our platform these new enhancements as part of our onvia  release will replace existing processes and features of software assets currently capitalized on our balance sheet we determined that the estimated useful lives of the affected capitalized costs must be shortened to coincide with the estimated release of the new enhanced features and functions we have accelerated the amortization of  in internal software costs beginning in the third quarter of  through the

the results required to fund executive compensation arrangements in addition due to the companys small size increased variable sales costs and investment may exceed the incremental revenue generated each period which could negatively impact short term adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure at december   cash cash equivalents and available for sale investments increased to

presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other financial measures so calculated and presented nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the companys liquidity onvia defines adjusted ebitda as net income  loss before interest expense and other noncash financing costs interest and miscellaneous income taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stockbased compensation  other companies including onvias competitors may define adjusted ebitda differently onvia presents adjusted ebitda because it believes adjusted ebitda to be an important supplemental measure of performance that is commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in similar industries and size management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting it may not be indicative of the historical operating results of onvia nor is it intended to be predictive of potential future results investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap see reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda below for further information on this nongaap measure and for a reconciliation of gaap net loss to

annual report on form k and quarterly reports on form q with a calculation of annual contract value acv and dollar retention  onvia presents these metrics in aggregate and separately for the strategic accounts and small business legacy accounts sales channels these metrics are not financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or any other financial measures so calculated management uses this information as a basis for planning and forecasting core business activity for future periods and believes it is useful in understanding the results of its operations  acv represents the annualized aggregate revenue value of all subscription contracts as of the end of the quarter acv is driven by annual contract value per client acvc and the number of clients most of onvias revenues are generated from subscription contracts which are typically prepaid and have a minimum term of one year with revenues recognized ratably over the term of the subscription onvia also receives revenue from multiyear content distribution partnerships standalone management reports document download services and list rental services which are not included in the calculation of acv  dollar retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of subscription contracts renewed including the value of contract upgrades during the most recent twelvemonth period by the total value of subscription contracts expiring over the same period dollar retention measures the percentage of dollars retained from the population of expiring contracts over a twelve month period  strategic accounts are those clients from a target market that are believed to have a long term strategic interest in the state and local government market small business legacy accounts clients are primarily long term customers that were acquired prior to a change in
