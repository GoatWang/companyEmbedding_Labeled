looks abroad chinas largest online travel agency notched growth in all four of its key business segments brian stoffel tmfcheesehead feb   at pm ctripcom nasdaqctrp chinas largest online travel agency ota announced earnings for the fourth quarter of  this week and the company saw rapid revenue growth a strategic move toward travel outside of china and  most impressively  expanding margins image source getty images ctripcom results the raw numbers because the companys profitability is significantly skewed due to the consolidation of qunar these are the results that most investors are focused on metric q  q  yearoveryear change revenue  million  million  gross profit  million  million  operating profit  million  million  data source ctripcom  these results came in ahead of management expectations and show just how much leverage the company has now that the ota industry in china has undergone massive consolidation the companys nongaap operating margin increased from  during the fourth quarter of  to  in the most recent quarter the importance of that basispoint expansion cannot be overstated growth in product development and sales and marketing spending actually outpaced revenue growth but this has more to do with assuming all of the obligations associated with qunar than actual increases in spending indeed on a sequential basis spending on these two divisions was actually down  and  respectively from the previous quarter breaking down the numbers further as is the companys tradition all four of the key business segments were given more specific breakdowns division sales yearoveryear growth transportation  million  accommodations  million  packaged tours  million  corp travel  million  data source ctripcom here again the company did not disappoint the rapid growth of revenue in transportation and accommodations shows that the network effect is truly taking hold as more people flock to ctrip to buy tickets vendors are incentivized to join the network as vendors join chinese citizens have more reasons to use the platform its a virtuous cycle that helps drive results and compound gains for decades  and keeps whatever competition is left at bay that was evident in both train and bus ticketing while the revenue that these two provide pales in comparison to airline travel these segments grew sales by  and  respectively over the past year what else happened during the quarter in late  ctrip announced that it would be acquiring scotlandbased skyscanner a global metasearch engine for travel the transition closed during the fourth quarter founder and chairman james liang said together with skyscanner we expect to further extend our international air ticketing services to local customers in asiapacific and other markets around the world as the chinese middle class continues to grow they will likely be going beyond the middle kingdoms borders skyscanner is the companys attempt to make sure that those customers dont migrate to other global otas when the time comes to make travel plans looking ahead alas the days of  growth cant last forever thats to be expected when you have larger and larger hurdles to jump over moving forward management sees revenue growing by  to  management sees margins improving to somewhere between  and  over the next three years if margins continue to expand at that rate theres still plenty of very
