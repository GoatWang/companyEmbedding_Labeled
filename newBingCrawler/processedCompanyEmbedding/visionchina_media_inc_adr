inc adr nasdaqvisn is off to a lousy start monday morning after friday’s runup from  to  was halted pending further news today visn stock opened  lower amid that “further news” namely it announced new details concerning the sale of its subway mobile tv ad business for those unfamiliar with visionchina its business is in advertising focusing on china’s mass transportation systems through mobile digital television networks currently visn has more than  buses running free wifi hotspots under the brand name “vifi” in china the deal sees the company selling off  of its stake in visionchina new culture media co which is visn’s subway mobile tv ad business to ledman optoelectronic ceo limin li had this to say “the sale of our subway mobile tv advertising business is a critical and strategic step for visionchina media and we remain open in the future to sell the remaining  of our equity position in new culture we believe the execution of the new agreements with ledman will provide significant flexibility to satisfy our working capital needs and allow us to focus our resources on the fast growing wifi business and to further strengthen our leading position in china’s urban mass transit wifi market” ledman agreed to pay visn  million yuan translating to roughly  million in us dollars li anticipates the deal will close in “the near future” where ledman will pay an installment of  million yuan about  million to visionchina under the terms visn is required to use the payment in full to buy ledman shares in a block trade within five business days of the payment  stocks to sell or short into the ground the remaining amount will be paid by ledman within  business days not including the block trade time allotment after the close of the deal theses shares are subject to a lockup until may   which doesn’t allow visionchina to sell more than threefourths of its ledman shares during the first full year after the lockup expires the deal also prevents visn and affiliates from doing similar business to its nowsold new culture subway mobile tv advertising business for up to eight years after the transaction closes what’s more visionchina is on the hook for its new culture business if it fails to meets its profit targets in yuan of  million  million and  million respectively for   and  in such cases visn will have to pay the difference by returning its acquired ledman shares or pay in cash if the shares are not enough as of press time visn stock was off closer to  with shares bouncing between support at  and resistance at  visionchina temporarily broke above resistance friday before shares were halted pending news of its revised pact with ledman as of this writing john kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities more from
