equates to an inner join where the joincondition always evaluates to either true or where the joincondition is absent from the statement syntax the basic syntax of the cartesian join or the cross join is as follows − select tablecolumn tablecolumn from table table  table  example consider the following two tables table  − customers table is as follows   id  name  age  address  salary      ramesh    ahmedabad       khilan    delhi       kaushik    kota       chaitali    mumbai       hardik    bhopal       komal    mp       muffy    indore     table  orders table is as follows −  oid  date  customerid  amount                                            now let us join these two tables using inner join as follows − sql select id name amount date from customers orders this would produce the following result −   id  name  amount  date      ramesh          ramesh          ramesh          ramesh          khilan          khilan          khilan          khilan          kaushik
