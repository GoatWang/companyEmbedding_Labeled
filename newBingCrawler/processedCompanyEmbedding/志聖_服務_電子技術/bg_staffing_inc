principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and the rules of the us securities and exchange commission to help the readers understand the companys financial performance the company supplements its gaap financial results with adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company adjusted ebitda is not measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from periodtoperiod and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under gaap can provide alone in addition the financial covenants in our credit agreement are based on adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit agreement we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest expense income taxes
