shortterm changes and the rapidly growing complexity without jacking up it expenditures i am pleased that together with the allgeier group we can continue to pursue this vision and write the next chapters of the metasonic success story” says herbert kindermann managing director of the software manufacturer metasonic gmbh with its metasonic suite metasonic provides next generation software and a platform for agile process applications  the basis of the metasonic suite is the socalled subjectoriented business process management sbpm with this approach each and every user can create his or her own solutions and immediately execute them  this can be realized in a simple manner using only a limited number of symbols in a modeling language that closely approximates natural language with complete sentences this leads to significant time and cost savings as a result sbpm differs from traditional methods which for instance use bpmn  or bpel in that sbpm increases above all the performance of the processes while reducing at the same time the complexity  without programming process models that are designed with the help of the metasonic suite can be executed directly as an application in addition with this in mind metasonic offers with metasonic touch a unique way to create subjectorientedbased solutions “our easy to use modeling table is lowering the inhibition threshold of information technology a domain that appears highly complex to some and encouraging communication between it and the business departments within the company” explains kindermann users are able to move the individual tangible modeling building blocks on the table surface allowing them to model workflows directly workflows thus created are seamlessly integrated into the metasonic suite and can be executed immediately as a web application the products are marketed on a global basis and are already used successfully at a number of large international customers gartner the leading worldwide information technology research and consulting company has named metasonic in its  report the coveted status „cool vendor“ for business process management software  gartner cool vendors in
