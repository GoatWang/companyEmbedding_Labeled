repair shops claimscope navigator a webbased system that builds reports to help insurers compare their performance against competitors and ccc autoverse providing insurers with data from appraisers to help them better manage the claim lifecycle lawyer founds company in the s ccc was founded by howard allen tullman who was born in st louis in  after earning his undergraduate degree from northwestern university in  he enrolled at northwesterns school of law graduating in  following his admittance to the illinois bar tullman joined the chicago law firm of levy and erens where for the next ten years he specialized in federal litigation he became involved in some large classaction law cases which required him to maintain communications with thousands of people and led to the use of computerized databases out of this experience grew the idea to apply computer technology to the automobile claims process in  tullman founded certified collateral corporation a partnership launched with a  investment to provide carvaluation information to auto insurers which used the data to set the value of losses on stolen vehicles or those involved in accidents for decades auto values were determined by the blue book and red book published guides they were maintained manually requiring adjustors to fill out spec sheets and mail them in and the material then had to be assembled and printed as a result the information was far from timely to keep its valuation system current ccc created a massive database of car dealers new and used inventories because the system which was introduced in  could be updated every few days and reflected the actual prices car dealers asked for used cars insurance companies began to adopt the service moreover many states did not allow insurance companies to share information providing an opening for an independent database company like ccc in late  tullman took ccc public raising  million to expand the business within two years the company signed eight of the top us auto insurers as customers and spread its operations to  states ccc was used in  insurance claims in its first year  in  and well over  in  in short order all of the top  insurers in the united states became subscribers and cccs service was used to settle more than  percent of total loss claims the chicago suntimes in a  company profile described the nature of the system certified gets its blue book price information directly from dealers in return people who had had their cars stolen or destroyed and are looking for a certain type of used car are referred to the dealers by certified insurance companies tap into regional car price information through an automated telecommunications system we constructed a circle that said we will help those insured people shop for a new car and well steer them back to the dealers in the meantime the dealers will give us the price information that helps the insurance companies tullman said ccc also added the ability to check vehicles digit identification number vin which insurance companies could use in the effort to eliminate fraud at the time it was estimated that about  percent of car insurance premiums were the result of claims filed on paper cars vehicles reported as wrecked or stolen but which in reality did not exist as described by the chicago suntimes in a typical fraud scheme a person obtains a vin number perhaps from a junked car and takes out policies with several companies he later reports the car stolen and collects thousands of dollars from each insurer think about it tullman said how do most people buy car insurance they pick up the phone and call their agent and he asks them for the vin number the agent never sees the car  rapid growth in the mids ccc grew at a rapid clip during its first few years in  reaching  million in sales an  percent increase over  and posting  million in net income  percent better than the previous year tullman who had other entrepreneurial interests attempted to sell the company in  compucard international a telephone marketer of legal services and merchandise negotiated a  million stock transaction to acquire ccc but the deal was eventually abandoned reportedly due to differences in corporate cultures the company now attempted to broaden its business and become a national clearinghouse of automobile information that not only served insurance companies but also banks auto dealers and possibly consumers in keeping with this plan the company changed its name to ccc information services inc it then completed a secondary offering of stock underwritten by morgan stanley  co raising  million the proceeds of which were earmarked to upgrade the companys infrastructure and to fund possible acquisitions despite his ambitious plans for ccc in the summer of  tullman again attempted to sell the company this time to fort lauderdalebased safecard services inc provider of credit card protection services in a stock exchange valued at  million however this sale also fell through after american express co announced that it would allow its contract with safecard to expire at years end as a result safecards stock plunged and in a fiveday span the company lost  percent of its market value because of the pending stock swap ccc was pulled down as well dropping approximately  percent in value the acquisition was called off in october  and cccs stock began to rebound by that time the landscape for the company had changed in another way for the first time in its history ccc had to contend with serious competition in the form of autoinfo inc a new yorkbased company that maintained a database of junkyard auto parts for insurance companies autoinfo aligned itself with kelley blue book co an auto valuation publisher since  to create a tollfree telephone service that provided an instant fair market valuation of a car to insurance appraisers and adjusters moreover it charged about half of cccs  transaction fee in its favor ccc was a well entrenched market leader and autoinfo proved in the long run to be a minor nuisance tullman finally found a buyer in  when david m phillips put together a group of investors to acquire ccc in a million leveraged buyout phillips then took over as chairman and ceo of the company prior to ccc phillips had spent ten years at citibank where he ultimately served as a senior vicepresident responsible for latin american consumers businesses including banks life insurance companies finance companies and credit card firms for his part tullman became involved in other startups and eventually became president of chicagos kendall college under phillips ccc developed several new products during the s the company introduced ezest in  the first estimating tool in the auto industry that worked on a personal computer rather than a mainframe two years later the company offered eznet the first system that connected insurers with repair shops in this way consumers would now find their claim data available to the repair shop as soon as they arrived to continue to develop new products that would keep ccc in the forefront phillips needed more funding and in  sold a percent controlling interest to a white plains new york investment firm white river ventures inc phillips stayed on to run the now privately owned ccc which in  introduced pathways a suite of workflowmanagement products that dealt with the entire auto claims process to raise funds for further product development ccc was taken public once again in august  raising  million white river retained a significant stake which harvard university would inherit two years later when the school acquired the fund for the year  the company generated sales of  million resulting in a net profit of  million the next major product launch came in  with the pathways image library it relied on the internet to store and retrieve digital photos of cars used in the claims process in this way a mechanic in a repair shop could photograph a car and quickly send the image online to an insurers claims office company perspectives ccc has one overriding goal to put people back into their cars faster while ccc was building a solid reputation in the s especially with insurers the company was not without its share of critics its total loss valuation product was cited in a number of lawsuits filed against insurance companies by unhappy policyholders who contended that insurers undervalued totaled vehicles plaintiff attorneys argued that the reason ccc was so popular with insurers was its proclivity for giving the lowest price possible for a total loss evaluation ccc primarily based its valuation on the take price for a vehicle comparable to the one that was lost take prices according to the attorneys excluded sales commissions and represented the lowest amount a dealer would sell a vehicle to a cash customer that day because ccc did not determine the settlement amount it was not a party in the litigation furthermore since insurance companies were its major customers ccc suffered no adverse impact from the controversy new leadership and continued growth late s to mids after phillips retired in april  he was replaced by githesh ramamurthy who had joined ccc as chief technology officer in  several years later ramamurthy won a patent for the companys claims processing software design having been a part of ccc major investment in new product development he was eager to launch a new research and development push this time to leverage the power of the internet to increase the number of daily transactions from one million to ten million he poured an estimate  million into new economy initiatives as well as an expansion into europe and a handful of businesstobusiness joint ventures including one with partners automatic data processing inc and reynolds  reynolds co to create a webbased system for repair shops to help them find parts arrange delivery and then get their claims paid by insurers in  ccc launched drivelogic its integrated information system for internet and wireless technology cccs adoption of a new economy strategy was ill fated however as the internet bubble burst and the stock market began to plummet in  previously debt free ccc was now burdened with  million in debt and much of its cash flow was being consumed by its new ventures although sales increased to  million in  the company lost  million the following year it lost another  million on sales of  million with the company on the verge of ruin ramamurthy was forced to take decisive steps he withdrew from all of the new ventures with the exception of drivelogic and slashed the companys  workforce almost in half ramamurthy also arranged for new financing of  million from new yorkbased capricorn holdings inc and harvard as a result of these steps ccc was able to rebound in  trimming its debt and returning to profitability netting  million on sales of  million in  ccc increased its repair shop customer base by acquiring columbus ohiobased compest estimating solutions inc from hearst corp in addition to adding another  customers ccc added additional electronic estimating and other tools used by collision repair shops ccc also improved its position in the marketplace in  by rolling out upgraded versions of ccc pathways ccc autoverse and ccc pathways professional advantage although sales grew modestly in  totaling  million net income increased solidly to  million moreover the company was well positioned to take advantage of an anticipated increase in information technology spending by its customers in  revenues reached  million although net income slipped to  million nevertheless ccc continued to position itself for ongoing growth during the year it introduced the first integrated estimating system ccc pathways estimating solution version which combined auditing digital imaging shop management and framedimension applications in a single package eliminating the need to refer to a separate cdrom for additional information or to buy a separate auditing tool ccc looked to expand its reach beyond automobiles to the recreational vehicle and motorcycle industries forging alliances with duncan systems a leading player in the rv estimating data field and urban publications the leading provider of estimating services for motorcycles atvs and scooters for a start ccc would resell its partners products but it was also launching an effort to incorporate them into other ccc systems the company as a result looked to solidify its leading position in the claims marketplace principal
