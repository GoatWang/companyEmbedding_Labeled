through december   the company’s revised fullyear  adjusted eps guidance does not anticipate any share repurchase impact fis has not provided a reconciliation of the foregoing forwardlooking guidance to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted ebitda or adjusted eps because such measures are not available at this time without unreasonable efforts the significant impact of the sungard acquisition including among other things the timing and amount of integration and severance costs and the transition of systems facilities and personnel make it difficult to provide meaningful and comparable gaap guidance webcast fis will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community beginning at  am edt wednesday august   to access the webcast go to the investor relations section of fis’ homepage wwwfisglobalcom a replay will be available after the conclusion of the live webcast use of nongaap financial information generally accepted accounting principles gaap is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting gaap includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we have provided certain nongaap financial measures these nongaap measures include adjusted revenue ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin constant currency revenue organic revenue growth adjusted net earnings from continuing operations including per share amounts adjusted cash flow from operations and free cash flow these nongaap measures may be used in this release andor in the attached supplemental financial information we believe these nongaap measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business as further described below the nongaap revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of fis’s core operating performance the “constant currency” and “organic revenue” measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations while organic revenue also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures giving investors further insight into our core performance finally the nongaap cash flow measures provide further information about the ability of our business to generate cash for these reasons management also uses these nongaap measures in its assessment and management of fis’ performance adjusted revenue consists of reported revenue increased to reverse the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment made upon the acquisition of sungard the deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by sungard under gaap but was not recognized due to gaap purchase accounting adjustments the deferred revenue adjustment in purchase accounting was made entirely in the corporate and other segment reported gaap results for the ifs and gfs segments are not affected by this adjustment and therefore no adjusted revenue is presented for these segments ebitda reflects earnings from continuing operations before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda excludes certain costs and other transactions which management deems nonoperational in nature the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods this measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance for this reason adjusted ebitda as it relates to our segments is presented in conformity with accounting standards codification  segment reporting and is excluded from the definition of nongaap financial measures under the securities and exchange commissions regulation g and item e of regulation sk adjusted ebitda margin reflects adjusted ebitda divided by adjusted revenue constant currency revenue represents i adjusted revenue in respect of the consolidated results and the corporate and other segment and ii reported revenue in respect of the ifs and gfs segments in each case excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period organic revenue growth is constant currency revenue as defined above for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period which is further adjusted to exclude the impact of any acquisitions and divestitures by fis during the applicable reporting period adjusted net earnings from continuing operations excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems nonoperational in nature the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods it also excludes the impact of acquisitionrelated purchase accounting amortization which is recurring adjusted net earnings per diluted share or adjusted eps reflects adjusted net earnings from continuing operations divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding adjusted cash flow from operations reflects gaap cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and excludes certain transactions that are closely associated with nonoperating activities or are otherwise nonoperational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows free cash flow reflects adjusted cash flow from operations less capital expenditures free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure any nongaap measures should be considered in context with the gaap financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures further fis’ nongaap measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies reconciliations of these nongaap measures to related gaap measures including footnotes describing the specific adjustments are
