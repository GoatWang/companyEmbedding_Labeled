location  saitama japan product  itg application  transportation and logistics user’s profile maruwa opened a new shizuoka food delivery center in july  as the logistics base for supermarkets in shizuoka area this delivery center is situated in very good location approximate km away from shimadakanaya interchange of new tomei highway maruwa targets transport and logistics for food distribution mainly for supermarkets as most important business criteria focusing on very high growth rate in supermarkets maruwa targets local supermarkets which mainly supply fresh foods for local customers mr ominato general manager of pl operation hq told “ there are still active local supermarkets and those local supermarkets are and will be supported by local people then we would like to support such active supermarkets by closely providing local foods day by day ” as well as pl operations maruwa provides management support services called “ azcom pl which includes reduction of sales administration cost they also support opening food service delivery center with a supermarket mr ominato streeses that maruwa can contribute not only for total logistics cost reduction but also for new business development for our customers ” in the logistics center handheld terminal plays an important role mr ominato explains that using auto id tools is inevitable to have much skilled labors and increase our productivity mr ominato adds that investing for auto id and handheld terminals is more costeffective for maruwa than large capital investment considering that business size of local supermarkets is around usd to  billi the reason behind the adoption of new it system casio itg handheld terminal is now used in the delivery center itg is used for cargo receipt and goods in for product registration to wms by checking itf barcodes of outer cases most important function is auto capturing of food expiration date with ocr reading in itg’s cmos camera all expiration dates of all products are checked in the delivery center after checking expiration date goodsin operation is completed with printing goodsin label including location date product name janitf code number of the carton box and expiration date maruwa has used casio dtx handheld before and decided to replace by new itg handheld  inch large size display and touch screen panel are preferred by maruwa but most important point was using ocr function for food expiration date control as food quality control is one of most concerned subjects among japanese consumers and maruwa set top priority on this subject at the same time itg is also used for picking delivered items operator picks ordered items up according to order pickling list and location instruction per product expiration date is also automatically checked for each ordered item remark  itg japanese domestic model has some original functions different from overseas models product  utilization itg series handheld terminals category
