are highlights from monday’s analyst blog  stocks to buy on big new jobs numbersjob additions increased significantly in january in yet another signal that president trump has inherited a particularly healthy economy in fact the labor market is nearing full employment borne out by the decline in wage gains however hiring remains strong overall and there is evidence to show that more and more people

financial and professional services and the restaurant sector are at the forefront of job gains this is why investing in stocks from these areas would make for a smart choicehighest job additions in four monthsthe us economy added  jobs during the month of january significantly higher than the  jobs added during december this also exceeds the consensus estimate of  job additions additionally these are the best monthly job gains since septemberfor the month of january the retail construction finance and professional services sectors provided the highest job additions employment in the

a full employment scenario weighed on workers’ pay with average hourly wages rising only  in january lower than december’s downwardly revised gain of  further the unemployment rate meantime ticked up
