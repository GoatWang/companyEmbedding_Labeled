facebook twitter advanced environmental petrolm prdcr inc otcmktsaepp is a microcap stock that has started to garner attention as the stock launches up the chart in recent action we’ve seen no press releases and no clear narrative emerge however the company has put out a couple of filings that may clarify the picture a bit we will cover them below but the picture we get suggests a major transition into a new entity as for the action itself traders will note nearly  during the past month in terms of shareholder gains in the company but this action is running counter to the larger trend in the name market participants may want to pay attention to this stock aepp is a stock who’s past is littered with sudden rips what’s more the company has benefitted from a jump in recent trading volume to the tune of exceeding  over the long run average this is particularly important due to the relatively small float size in the stock roughly m shares one is wise to respect the dynamic this may create — a mechanically driven price squeeze can result from this type of mix of small float and ramping attention from traders advanced environmental petrolm prdcr inc otcmktsaepp has framed itself as a public oil  gas company trading on the otcqb market the company develops an advanced environmental process for extracting oil  gas resources with the goal of minimal damage to the environment according to the company’s prior materials the process allows it to reinstate the ground as it develops to leave minimal to no scarring the processed areas are converted into engineered farmland for the local communities over the past eight  years psp pointsource processing has spent in excess of usd million in qualifying the natural resource deposit and is in the process to obtain a third party engineering report which estimates the proven resources of oil  gas according to most recent press materials from  months back “aepp will become an oil and gas exploration and development company operating in peru where it has a number of targets in the highly prospective block  of the southern region of that country the company will hold an exclusive license which entitles it to explore and develop certain oil and gas properties known as “block ” an area of  square km” find out when aepp stock reaches critical levels subscribe to oracledispatchcom right now by entering your email in the box below as for clarifying the narrative on the recent move we would note the company’s two recent filings first on march   the company filed a schedule f information statement which is generally part of the process of changing the majority of the board this was followed by an k on march   reading into the documents this looks like a wholesale change of the company into a different entity achieved via a  majority ownership change through a stock purchase agreement to wit the stipulation notes that the company’s current lone employee executive officer director and principal executive officer principal financial officer and principal accounting officer brian k kistler shall resign all such positions with the company immediately following the new board’s appointment of michael t redman as a director to the board and chief executive officer president principal executive officer and principal financial officer as well as one j donald payne as a director to the board and secretary and chief accounting officer mr redman is currently the chief executive officer president and a director and mr payne is the senior vice president – finance and administration and secretary of the purchaser oncolix inc so long story short as near as we can tell aepp is becoming oncolix inc a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company based in houston texas the company is developing prolanta a targeted therapeutic protein for the treatment of ovarian breast and other cancers prolanta is an antagonist of the human prolactin receptor blocking the effects of human prolactin  “there is substantial scientific evidence that human prolactin is associated with the growth of certain cancers as well as resistance of cancers to platinum and taxane therapies  by blocking the effects of prolactin prolanta™ has demonstrated a high level of efficacy in ovarian and breast cancer models and is also expected to be effective in models of other cancers” we will get more clarity on things no doubt in coming days and weeks as it stands earning a current market cap value of m aepp has virtually no cash on the books which stands against about k total current liabilities the company is prerevenue at this point we will update the story again soon as developments transpire for continuing coverage on shares of aepp stock as well as our other hot stock picks

 insider financial insider financial receive realtime shortterm momentum stock alertsno spam no hidden fees unsubscribe anytime analyst actions advanced environmental petrolm prdcr inc otcmktsaepp gets a new lifeline by jarrod wesson posted on july   share tweet share share email comments did you not notice the upward trend on the share price of advanced environmental petrolm prdcr inc otcmktsaepp commenced at the end of june not many people in wall street got to know it because the volume shown was very light in addition the press release which we believe caused the market move was not put out on every website on yahoo finance for example nobody could find it it was this hidden document that the company released here which caused the share price spike this is exclusive information from us do you want to know what is it about keep reading after you note the  return that aepp returned in less than five days we will explain what happened source business – what did go wrong advanced environmental petroleum producers inc aepp was founded in florida in june  in an initial phase the company provided consultancy services to the electric vehicle research and technologies industry but the business objective was expanded in  the company commenced “energy operations through a planned acquisition of exploration properties in peru“ which recently turned to be a bad business the acquisition of peruvian exploration properties was unfortunately terminated as the terms of the acquisition were not fulfilled this is from one of the documents released by the company “during february  the planned acquisition of the peruvian exploration properties was terminated because of the failure to complete the terms of the acquisition immediately following this termination aepp had limited or no operating activities and no tangible assets but had significant liabilities” source how did the company react to the failure management was quite fast it rapidly decided to exchange the common stock for outstanding debt to reduce the liabilities of the company this was completely necessary in order to commence a new activity “on march   interim management was issued  shares of common stock to pay acquire or reach agreement with aepp’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of aepp and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations including any fees for services rendered” source the company found a new activity and a new partner soon on march   oncolix inc a houstonbased clinicalstage biotechnology company acquired all the common stock owned by the management this is what we found hidden in one of the documents released by the company the change of control was announced on april   “on april   interim management completed the sale  shares of common stock to oncolix interim management resigned all positions with the company and two officers of oncolix were appointed as the sole directors of aepp resulting in a change in control of aepp” source it seems that oncolix will merge with aepp but this potential buyer has not announced anything yet the market reacted by pushing up the share price when oncolix appeared in april later in may and june the share price remained quiet and calm until this document was released on june   the new announcements that caused the spike listing on a moreestablished trading venue and reverse merger in the document that was released to the market in this corporate website the following words were found of michael t redman chairman of the board “we have no current plans to effect a forward or reverse split of aepp’s common stock we will continue to evaluate the establishment of new operations with the goal to attract external financing and allow us to ultimately seek listing on a moreestablished trading venue which we believe is in the best interest of our stockholders” source in our opinion the market celebrated that the chairman will not effect a reverse split rather he plans to list the shares on a better exchange the stock split does not generally help stockholders it is an artificial modification of the share price that is usually not appreciated by the market and tends to erode shareholders’ value it is a great news that the company will not do it additionally if the shares are listed on a better exchange such as the nasdaq or the nyse many more market participants will check the share price consequently demand for the stock may increase and the share price could raise be alert on this type of news either by visiting the company’s website or subscribing to our newsletter in addition the chairman said the following “we continue to evaluate options which we consider to be in the best interest of aepp’s stockholders these options include an offer to the stockholders of oncolix to acquire all of the outstanding stock of oncolix and merge the two companies in consultation with our legal tax and financial advisers we intend to finalize the terms and conditions of such offer during july  of course there can be no assurance that such terms and conditions with be acceptable to the stockholders of oncolix” source hence the company may be preparing an offer to merge oncolix and aepp that is what excited the market participants recently in addition the fact that the contract may be put out in july increased the market expectation for both companies a reverse merger could be great aepp will be running again an activity and will obtain assets and oncolix will obtain access to the financial markets is that a good deal for oncolix yes absolutely being public means that companies can obtain better financing conclusion the beginning of  was terrible for aepp stockholders the company could not finish the acquisition in peru and it ceased its operations consequently management exited the company and it was sold to debt holders it was a disaster and the share price collapsed things have changed recently showing what we always say “the market always overreacts to bad news” the company was sold to another partner oncolix inc which is a clinicalstage biotechnology company the corporate move was celebrated by the market and the share price was pushed up in may and april most recently we could find in a new document that the company is planning to merge the two companies the press release about the deal is expected to be published this month be alert on that news since it may be very beneficial for the share price subscribe to our newsletter if you need rapid information we will be updating our subscribers as soon as
