operations the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth elsewhere in this report and discussed in our other sec filings the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report the consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of actua corporation a company incorporated in delaware and its subsidiaries both whollyowned and consolidated actua corporation and all such subsidiaries are collectively hereafter referred to as actua the company we our or us and have been prepared in accordance with gaap executive summary actua is a multivertical cloud technology company with offerings that we believe create unique and compelling value for our customers and provide transformative efficiency to vertical markets we manage our consolidated vertical cloudbased businesses which operate in the commercial and personal property and casualty insurance wealth management government communications and environmental health and safety ehs markets with a uniform set of industrystandard recurring revenue metrics and specifically look to drive growth at those businesses by continuously creating compelling differentiated cloudbased products and services through investment in research and development driving efficient longterm growth in recurring revenue through investment in lead generation marketing and sales identifying structuring and executing accretive acquisitions that accelerate strategic plans increase revenue growth and over time improve margins investing in and cultivating deep domainexpert management teams and implementing strategies to obtain operational leverage and increased profitability while maintaining high revenue growth particularly as a company scales we believe that through those and other measures we are developing a set of leading businesses that possess unique assets which are hard to replicate and which provide competitive differentiation in the sizable vertical markets in which they operate we believe further that our vertical cloud business model focus which drives the compelling value proposition of our businesses wellpositions us to generate sustained meaningful longterm returns for our stockholders through among other things strong gross margins disciplined customer acquisition and attractive lifetime customer values which allow for efficient growth through investment in sales and marketing economies of scale inherent in multitenancy software architecture which allow a focus on innovation and ultimately longterm profitability and operating cash flow the results of operations of our businesses are reported in two segments the vertical cloud reporting segment and the vertical cloud venture reporting segment our vertical cloud reporting segment reflects the aggregate financial results of our businesses in which our management takes a very active role in providing strategic direction and operational support and towards which we devote relatively large proportions of our personnel financial capital and other resources as of the date of this report we own substantial majority controlling equity positions in and therefore consolidate the financial results of each of the four businesses in our vertical cloud segment bolt of which we own  foliodynamix of which we own  govdelivery of which we own  and velocityehs of which we own  as described in expanded detail below each of our four vertical cloud businesses bolt foliodynamix govdelivery and velocityehs offers cloudbased products and services that address the needs of a specific vertical market or industry each of those businesses competes with one or more traditional or cloudbased software firms some of which have a horizontalmultiindustry focus and some of which may have better name recognition and greater financial and other resources than our businesses do we believe that each of our businesses is wellpositioned to compete with those firms because of among other things the vertical domain expertise and verticallyfocused technology that we have cultivated approximately  commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from over  carriers that bolt is able to offer through its platform the broad reach of foliodynamixs wealth management platform which serviced approximately  billion of assets under management aum as of march   and its complementary investment advisory services which encompassed approximately  billion of aum of which  billion are regulatory aum as of march   govdeliverys subscriber base in excess of  million interested citizens and velocityehs industryleading proprietary database which contains over  million safety data sheets another key component of our business strategy in addition to our multivertical domain expertise and effective and efficient research and development is the leverage inherent in the recurring revenue generated by our cloudbased software delivery model in part because our customers are required to make periodic payments to continue receiving access to our cloudbased products and services we have established longterm relationships with our customers many of which are governed by multiyear contracts that have historically high renewal rates the consistent revenue stream provided by our recurring revenue model coupled with our relatively high gross margins allow us to drive revenue growth more consistently over time through investment in lead generation sales and marketing in order to ensure that we are effectively leveraging our cloudbased model we closely monitor and manage the revenue growth rates along with the gross margins number of customers and a variety of customer retention and sales efficiency metrics at each of our businesses through the first quarter of  bolts revenue grew approximately  in the threemonth period ended march   from the corresponding prior year period during the three months ended march   bolt served approximately  independent commercial and personal property and casualty insurance agent customers seven large commercial and personal property and casualty insurance carrieragency customers six customers who are nontraditional sellers of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and one state commercial and personal property and casualty insurance exchange customer foliodynamixs revenue was essentially flat from the corresponding threemonth prior year period and during the three months ended march   it served over  direct financial services organizations such as brokerage firms banks trust and retail large registered investment advisors rias and ria networks and other feebased managed account providers govdeliverys revenue grew approximately  from the corresponding threemonth prior year period and during the three months ended march   it served over  government entities agencies and organizations at the national state and local levels in both the united states and europe and velocityehs revenue grew approximately  from the corresponding threemonth prior year period during the three months ended march   velocityehs served around  customers approximately  are platform customers consisting of large and midmarket north american businesses in a wide variety of industries we also actively source and intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that would provide one or more of our businesses with critical mass complementary cloudbased products and services to sell to existing customers additional customers for existing cloudbased products and services access to adjacent cloud computing markets andor technology that is a differentiator in the business vertical cloud computing market for example in january  velocityehs acquired substantially all of the assets of ergoadvocate a company that provides ergonomics assessment and training software the acquisition allows velocityehs to provide a new offering to customers our ability to execute against our business strategy and continue to successfully grow our vertical cloud businesses will be dependent on a number of factors including the following the emergence of additional competitors in our markets and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors our prospective customers willingness to migrate to cloud computing services the availability performance and security of our cloudbased technology particularly in light of increased cybersecurity risks and concerns our ability to continue to drive successful customer adoption and utilization of our cloudbased technologies our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features and functionality our ability to continue to maintain a leadership role in the vertical industries in which we operate our ability to have continued access to capital and to manage capital resources effectively our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies acceptance of our cloudbased products and services in new markets or markets where we have few customers our ability to continue to maintain appropriate data center capacity and security as our businesses grow our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel particularly personnel with the vertical domain expertise that is critical to our success and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our cloudbased solutions delay customers purchasing decisions or affect customer attrition rates our vertical cloud businesses as of the date of this report we consolidated the following vertical cloud businesses bolt bolt offers a cloudbased platform that through its unique product and technology connectivity is changing the way insurance is sold the platform provides large commercial and personal property and casualty insurance carrieragencies with a means to enable all of their captive agents to meet the needs of their customers by giving them instant access to a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from a variety of other prominent carriers independent commercial and personal property and casualty insurance agents with a means to meet the needs of their customers by giving them instant access to a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from a variety of prominent carriers nontraditional sellers of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products with a means to meet the needs of their customers by giving them instant access to a cloudbased distribution network and a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from a variety of prominent carriers and commercial and personal property and casualty insurance carriers with a variety of additional distribution channels that foster a richer flow of business across their commercial and personal property and casualty insurance product lines bolt is able to provide its platformsubscriber customers and partners which include large insurance carrieragencies independent insurance agents and other insurancebased organizations with access to a wide array of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products through its agency appointments from various prominent insurance carriers any loss by bolt of one or more of these agency appointments or one or more of its large platform customers would have a negative impact on bolts business financial results and condition but bolt does not have any agency appointment or customer the loss of which would have a materially adverse financial impact on our vertical cloud business as a whole bolts platform customers pay both subscription and transactionbased fees commissions for use of its platform the insurance carriers whose products are sold on the platform pay bolt on a commissions basis for products sold bolt sells the periodic usually multiyear platform subscriptions to its customers and establishes and manages its carrier agency relationships directly through its internal sales team in addition to the revenue bolt derives from providing access to its platform bolt also operates as an independent insurance agency and sells commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products directly to consumers online through its platform those sales represent a relatively small percentage of bolts business the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources name recognition and market presence than bolt actively compete with bolt for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the cloud has increasingly become a source for the direct placement of personal business lines we believe that bolts unique platform and the product and technology connectivity that it offers allows bolt to compete in the insurance market in the three months ended march   bolt spent approximately  million on research and development activities as of march   bolt had  employees of which  were parttime employees foliodynamix foliodynamix offers wealth management service providers and financial advisors a comprehensive secure cloudbased wealth management technology platform and advisory solutions for managing the full wealth management lifecycle across all types of investment programs foliodynamix provides its customers with leadingedge technology to attract and retain the best advisors enable more effective business process management accelerate client acquisition and gain visibility across all aum foliodynamixs customers include a variety of financial services organizations such as brokerage firms banks trust and retail large rias and ria networks and other feebased managed account providers foliodynamixs customers access specified bundles of platform applications through the cloud on a periodic usually multiyear subscription basis foliodynamix sells the periodic subscriptions directly to its customers through its internal sales team foliodynamixs comprehensive integrated platform enables highly sophisticated management of all aspects of a financial services organizations wealth management process including proposal generation and investment policy statement management client acquisition and onboarding investment model management portfolio rebalancing trading and trade order management performance management and reporting and portfolio accounting foliodynamix complements its innovative wealth management platform and applications with institutionalquality research content and consulting expertise through its subsidiary fdx advisors inc fdx advisors fdx advisors is an ria firm that is independently available to help wealth management firms with due diligence and discretionary investment solutions that can be fully integrated with the foliodynamix technology platform the company charges its customers for these advisory services fees based on a specified percentage of aum foliodynamixs five largest customers in terms of revenue generation represented approximately  of its revenue for the three months ended march   although a loss of one or more of these customers most of which have been signed to longterm contracts through at least  would have a negative impact on foliodynamixs financial results and condition foliodynamix does not have any customer the loss of which would have a materially adverse financial impact on our vertical cloud businesses as a whole the market for wealth management software and advisory services is fragmented competitive and rapidly changing when selling its software to large financial services organizations foliodynamix faces competition from software companies who provide endtoend cloudbased solutions and an even larger number of software companies that offer individual point solutions some of these companies may have better name recognition and financial and other resources than foliodynamix to a lesser degree the company competes with inhouse solutions that its current and prospective clients may develop we believe that foliodynamixs sophisticated highlyscalable comprehensive cloudbased technology platform along with its deep wealth management domain knowledge and processes particularly in the areas of research and regulatory compliance provide it with a strong position in the wealth management software and advisory services market during the three months ended march   foliodynamix spent approximately  million on research and development activities as of march   foliodynamix had  employees of which  were parttime employees govdelivery govdelivery is a provider of cloudbased communication solutions that allow governments government agencies and government organizations to reach more people and mobilize them to action govdeliverys digital communication management platform enables the public sector to address a variety of real ongoing challenges it faces by interacting more efficiently with citizens through email mobile text alerts really simple syndication rss and social media channels through the govdelivery platform govdeliverys customers which include government entities agencies and organizations at the national state and local levels in both the united states and europe are able to increase online transactions such as registrations and renewals through personalized content reminders crosspromotion offers and other features promote successful events through multichannel communications personalized and contextual content and integration with other organizations and registration platforms manage emergency situations with realtime updates sophisticated audience targeting and integration with other emergency alert systems build communities around data and expand volunteerism with broad reach engaging content sophisticated audience targeting and indepth tracking analytics create modern training experiences that support regulatory compliance encourage disaster preparedness and advance community education through a unified platform with sophisticated audience targeting improve media relations with tools that streamline communications with media outlets and measure the level of engagement that media outlets have with their multichannel communications and drive increased digital engagement among citizens with a userfriendly integrated multichannel communications approach govdeliverys customers access the companys platform through the cloud on a periodic usually annual or multiyear subscription basis govdelivery sells the periodic subscriptions directly to its customers through its internal sales team since govdeliverys customers are government entities and government affiliates they generally have the right to terminate contracts upon notice at their unilateral election in addition govdelivery derives and will continue to derive the majority of its revenue from work performed for the united states federal government and federal government agencies some of which individually account for a significant amount of govdeliverys revenue however the work is performed under a myriad of separate independent relationships and agreements with various branches and agencies within the federal government the market for digital communication solutions in general is fragmented highly competitive and rapidly changing govdelivery provides its solutions exclusively to the public sector while its competitors generally focus on digital marketing solutions targeting either the small business market or the private sector enterprise market to a lesser degree govdelivery competes with inhouse solutions that its current and prospective customers may develop we believe that govdeliverys cloudbased technology and domain expertise which manifests itself in strong relationships with many government entities a subscriber base of more than  million interested citizens and a unique understanding of the daytoday communication challenges faced by public sector clients allows it to compete effectively against other digital communications service providers during the three months ended march   govdelivery spent approximately  million on research and development initiatives as of march   govdelivery had  employees of which  was a parttime employee velocityehs in september  msdsonline holdings inc undertook a rebranding effort and changed its corporate name to velocityehs holdings inc in order to reflect the completion of its transformation into
