overview we are a domestic provider of it staffing and digital transformation services to mostly large and mediumsized organizations the companys it staffing services span across digital and mainstream technologies while its digital transformation services include salesforcecom sap hana and digital learning services we do not sell lease or otherwise market computer software or hardware and  of our revenue is derived from the sale of it staffing and digital transformation services our it service business combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of services within business intelligence  data warehousing service oriented architecture web services enterprise resource planning  customer resource management ebusiness solutions mobile applications data management and analytics and the implementation and support for cloudbased applications we provide our services across various industry verticals including automotive consumer products education financial services government healthcare manufacturing retail technology telecommunications transportation and utilities we have one operating segment thus no segment related disclosures are presented we do however track and evaluate our revenues and gross profits by three distinct sales channels wholesale retail and permanent placements  fees our wholesale channel table of contents consists of system integrators and other staffing firms with a need to supplement their abilities to attract highlyqualified temporary technical computer personnel our retail channel focuses on clients that are endusers of it staffing services within the retail channel are enduser clients that have retained a third party to provide vendor management services commonly known in the industry as managed service providers msp our digital transformation services offerings are sold to clients within both the wholesale and retail sales channels while we have the ability to deliver our digital transformation services on a managed solutions basis essentially all of our assignments to date have been delivered as staffing engagements permanent placement  fee revenues are incidental revenues derived as byproduct opportunities of conducting our core contract staffing business economic trends and outlook generally our business outlook is highly correlated to general us economic conditions during periods of increasing employment and economic expansion demand for our services tends to increase conversely during periods of contracting employment and  or a slowing domestic economy demand for our services tends to decline as the economy slowed during the second half of  and recessionary conditions emerged in  and during much of  we experienced less demand for our staffing services during the second half of  we began to see signs of market stabilization and a modest pickup in activity levels within certain sales channels and technologies in  market conditions continued to strengthen over the course of the year and activity levels within most of our sales channels progressively improved in  and  activity levels continued to trend up in most technologies and sales channels during   and  we continued to see a steady flow of solid activity in our contract staffing business however tightness in the supply side skilled it professionals of our business in  and  negatively impacted our new assignment successes solid activity levels continued during the nine months of  however recruitment challenges remain due to the tightness in supply of skilled it professionals in addition to tracking general us economic conditions a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients accordingly our trends and outlook are impacted by the prospects and wellbeing of these specific clients this account concentration factor may cause our results of operations to deviate from the prevailing us economic trends from time to time in recent years a larger portion of our revenues have come from our wholesale sales channel which consists largely of strategic relationships with systems integrators and other staffing organizations this channel tends to carry lower gross margins but provides higher volume opportunities this trend in our business mix has impacted overall gross margins during the past several years the acquisition of hudson it in june  has increased our retail revenues and materially improved the balance of our business mix between the retail and wholesale channels within our retail sales channel many larger users of it staffing services are employing msps to manage their contractor spending in an effort to drive down overall costs this trend towards utilizing the msp model may pressure gross margins in the future results of operations for the three months ended september   as compared to the three months ended september   revenues revenues for the three months ended september   totaled  million compared to  million in the corresponding three month period of  our small revenue decline from a year earlier was due to a modest decline of consultants on billing partially offset by a slightly

information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap  investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of nongaap financial measures as an analytical tool  reconciliations of these nongaap measures to their comparable gaap measures are included in the attached financial tables we believe that providing nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per
