company on providing employers and professionals with career connections news tools and information today we serve multiple markets located throughout north america europe the middle east and the asia pacific region notes regarding the use of nongaap financial measures the company has provided certain nongaap financial information as additional information for its operating results  these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and may be different from similarly titled nongaap measures reported by other companies  the company believes that its presentation of nongaap measures such as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash stock based compensation expense other nonrecurring income or expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the companys management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes  the nongaap measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document  the company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures elsewhere in the document adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda marginadjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are nongaap metrics used by management to measure operating performance  management uses adjusted ebitda as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning including preparation of annual budgets analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors  the company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program  adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement represents net income plus to the extent deducted in calculating such net income interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization noncash stock option expenses losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness impairment charges with respect to longlived assets expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering extraordinary or nonrecurring noncash expenses or losses transaction costs in connection with the credit agreement up to  deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments writeoff of noncash stock compensation expense and business interruption insurance proceeds minus to the extent included in calculating such net income noncash income or gains interest income and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors management and investors with additional information to measure our performance provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense and tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and to estimate our value we also present adjusted ebitda because covenants in our credit agreement contain ratios based on this measure  our credit agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity  if our adjusted ebitda were to decline below certain levels covenants in our credit agreement that are based on adjusted ebitda may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our credit agreement adjusted ebitda margin is computed as adjusted ebitda divided by revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap as a measure of our profitability forwardlooking statements this press release and oral

and the asia pacific regionnotes regarding the use of nongaap financial measuresthe company has provided certain nongaap financial information as additional information for its operating results  these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and may be different from similarly titled nongaap measures reported by other companies  the company believes that its presentation of nongaap measures such as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash stock based compensation expense and other nonrecurring income or expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda excluding slashdot media and disposition related and other costs revenues excluding slashdot media net income excluding slashdot media and disposition related and other costs net income excluding impairment charge free cash flow diluted earnings per share excluding slashdot media and disposition related and other costs diluted earnings per share excluding impairment charge and net debt provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the companys management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes  the company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures in the section entitled supplemental information and nongaap reconciliationsadjusted ebitdaadjusted ebitda is a nongaap metric used by management to measure operating performance  management uses adjusted ebitda as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning including preparation of annual budgets analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors  the company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program  adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement represents net income plus to the extent deducted in calculating such net income interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization noncash stock option expenses losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness impairment charges with respect to longlived assets expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering extraordinary or nonrecurring noncash expenses or losses transaction costs in connection with the credit agreement up to  deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments writeoff of noncash stock compensation expense and business interruption insurance proceeds minus to the extent included in calculating such net income noncash income or gains interest income and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of businesswe present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors management and investors with additional information to measure our performance provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense and tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and to estimate our valuewe also present adjusted ebitda because covenants in our credit agreement contain ratios based on this measure  our credit agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity  if our adjusted ebitda were to decline below certain levels covenants in our credit agreement that are based on adjusted ebitda may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our credit agreementadjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap as a measure of our profitabilityadjusted ebitda excluding slashdot media and disposition related and other costsadjusted ebitda excluding slashdot media and disposition related and other costs is a nongaap metric used by management to measure operating performance management uses adjusted ebitda excluding slashdot media and disposition

is defined as diluted earnings loss per share less impact per share of impairment charge we consider diluted earnings per share excluding impairment charge to be an important measure of our financial performance as it better reflects the ongoing operations of the companyfree cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is an important nongaap measure as it provides useful cash flow information regarding our ability to service incur or pay down indebtedness or repurchase our common stock  we use free cash flow as a measure to reflect cash available to service our debt as well as to fund our expenditures  a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it includes cash used for capital expenditures during the period and is adjusted for acquisition related payments within operating cash flowsnet debtnet debt is defined as total principal outstanding less cash we consider net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and indicator of our ability to meet ongoing obligations  we also use net debt among other measures in evaluating our choices for capital deployment  net debt presented herein is a nongaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companiesforwardlooking statementsthis press release and oral statements made from time to time by our

pacific regionread morenotes regarding the use of nongaap financial measuresthe company has provided certain nongaap financial information as additional information for its operating results  these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and may be different from similarly titled nongaap measures reported by other companies  the company believes that its presentation of nongaap measures such as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash stock based compensation expense other nonrecurring income or expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the companys management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes  the nongaap measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document  the company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures elsewhere in the documentadjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda marginadjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are nongaap metrics used by management to measure operating performance  management uses adjusted ebitda as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning including preparation of annual budgets analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors  the company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program  adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement represents net income plus to the extent deducted in calculating such net income interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization noncash stock option expenses losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness impairment charges with respect to longlived assets expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering extraordinary or nonrecurring noncash expenses or losses transaction costs in connection with the credit agreement up to  deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments writeoff of noncash stock compensation expense and business interruption insurance proceeds minus to the extent included in calculating such net income noncash income or gains interest income and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of businesswe present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors management and investors with additional information to measure our performance provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense and tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and to estimate our valuewe also present adjusted ebitda because covenants in our credit agreement contain ratios based on this measure  our credit agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity  if our adjusted ebitda were to decline below certain levels covenants in our credit agreement that are based on adjusted ebitda may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our credit agreementadjusted ebitda margin is computed as adjusted ebitda divided by revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap as a measure of our profitabilityforwardlooking statementsthis press release and oral

markets located throughout north america europe the middle east and the asia pacific region notes regarding the use of nongaap financial measures the company has provided certain nongaap financial information as additional information for its operating results  these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and may be different from similarly titled nongaap measures reported by other companies  the company believes that its presentation of nongaap measures such as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash stock based compensation expense other nonrecurring income or expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the companys management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes  the nongaap measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document  the company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures elsewhere in the document adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda marginadjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are nongaap metrics used by management to measure operating performance  management uses adjusted ebitda as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning including preparation of annual budgets analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors  the company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program  adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement represents net income plus to the extent deducted in calculating such net income interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization noncash stock option expenses losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness impairment charges with respect to longlived assets expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering extraordinary or nonrecurring noncash expenses or losses transaction costs in connection with the credit agreement up to  deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments writeoff of noncash stock compensation expense and business interruption insurance proceeds minus to the extent included in calculating such net income noncash income or gains interest income and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors management and investors with additional information to measure our performance provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense and tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and to estimate our value we also present adjusted ebitda because covenants in our credit agreement contain ratios based on this measure  our credit agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity  if our adjusted ebitda were to decline below certain levels covenants in our credit agreement that are based on adjusted ebitda may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our credit agreement adjusted ebitda margin is computed as adjusted ebitda divided by revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap as a measure of our
