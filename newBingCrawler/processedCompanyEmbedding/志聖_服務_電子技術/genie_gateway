privacy convenience and security designed specifically for unbanked merchants and their customers a debit card which doesn’t contain any of your personal information – not even your name – just your ten digit card number “every day we are robbed of a little more of the privacy that we all cherish so much most people do not like living in a ‘glass house’ and are fighting to preserve what precious little privacy they have left smart shoppers wisely prefer not to share their credit card banking information – or even their home phone number – online or when making purchases by phone” visitors to the website can request the cards which are not personalized in any way and activate the cards by cell phone or on the internet they can then use the cards for phone online mobilebased or inperson transactions with any merchant or individual who uses the genie gateway service the company also distributes the cards free of charge to it merchant customers who can dispense them to their own customers for activation and use “the geniecard combines the best of two worlds” explained genie gateway coo randal skala ”the genie club – our closed loop member service which utilizes the genie cashbox – and check the open loop service which lets members access their funds from any checking account in any bank in the us stuart scamman cto of genie gateway expanded “given the hightech methods used by hackers which are advancing every day the time to take steps to protecting your privacy is now geniecard is that next step” “the geniecard is the fastest and safest way to send payments online via mobile devices in store or by phone making it both easy and safe for unbanked merchants and their customers to do business without using cash and without sharing financial information” mark newgreen genie gateway cfo then went into detail “if the balance in your cashbox is enough to cover your purchase then it’s processed automatically as a realtime peertopeer payment if your balance isn’t enough for the purchase then your payment is processed automatically as a debit to the checking account you provided in your original genie cashbox application” the geniecard will be a major game changer and everyone over the age of  with a valid checking account at any us bank can qualify no activation fee no monthly fee no credit check no employment verification no credit card needed

an entire new class of merchants genie tv is also a mechanism for media providers to recoup profits from lost advertising thomas e skala genie gateway ceo explained “cable tv companies wireless internet providers radio stations and newspapers all have inventories of a ‘perishable commodities’  their unsold advertising  “that’s an asset that just disappears” skala continued “if you don’t sell it before airtime or publication you can’t bank it… until now” “traditionally media providers with unsold advertising space or airtime run ‘house ads’ to fill the void” thomas a nix president of genie tv explained “genie tv gives them an alternative with an opportunity to convert that unsold advertising into long term residual revenues while helping unbanked merchants and individuals learn about new solutions and new ways they can join today’s ecommerce  online society” thomas nix expanded “genie tv will provide videos commercials and infomercials which can replace unsold advertising and when new customers subscribe to the service anytime they make a purchase from any merchant our advertising partners will generate residual income on all sales conducted by the merchants and for purchases made by consumers” genie tv cto roger pace then went into detail “the commercials videos and related network links are more than just another advertisement first the services advertised are expressly targeted at unbanked merchants and their customers – a huge underserved market but more important when a merchant or customer adopts the genie services the media provider running the ad in their otherwise ‘dead’ space will directly receive feebased residual revenue for the life of that buyer’s service usage” “genie tv will create an entirely new source of profit for the media provider by tying them directly into the economic activity of an almost completely untapped market for nothing more than the use of an existing ‘lost’ asset” concluded mark newgreen genie gateway cfo please visit
