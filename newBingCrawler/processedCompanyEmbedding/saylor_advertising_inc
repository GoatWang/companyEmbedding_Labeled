waiting in line at the supermarket—and as you’re not particularly interested in staring at the back of the customer in front of you you glance around the line the display of candy bars within immediate reach reminds you that you’re a little hungry so you grab one it’s on sale oh and that magazine looks interesting you’re already reading an article when you get to the cash register where the teller asks if you want to donate  to a charity and doing so you write your name on a little heart placard that gets placed on the wall with a hundred other hearts from other donators finally you complete your purchases and get your receipt—with several extra items you hadnt expected to buy point of sale marketing contents in this article what is point of sale marketing who employs point of sale marketing for what kinds of customers is point of sale marketing effective how is a point of sale marketing campaign developed what career titles work with point of sale marketing strategies how can a marketing school help you in this field what is point of sale marketing point of sale marketing refers to all efforts that increase sales at the point the purchase is actually made primarily this revolves around a cash register although a point of purchase for a business might be a meeting table or an internet page and is a staple of retail and restaurant environments the most common method of point of sale marketing is the merchandise display while other methods include the use of signage receipts and suggestive selling by the retailer at the pos see also shopper marketing who employs pointofsale marketing restaurants and retailers frequently use point of sale marketing tactics to encourage customers to make lastminute purchases however because retailers resell other business’ products point of sale marketing is significant to every company that sells items located atnear a retailer’s pos grocery stores commonly place merchandise shelving in between each available register featuring items such as magazines candy gum and batteries sodas are often displayed in a small refrigeration unit at the end of these displays items near the pos frequently move at oneandahalf to three times as fast as the same product on a shelf elsewhere in the store and some items in hightraffic supermarkets have been reported to sell as much as  times faster gas stations similarly line products at their register counter here energy vitamins and beef jerky are items added to those also commonly sold at grocery store registers fastfood restaurants commonly display desserts and gift cards at their pos dinein restaurants in which customers pay at the counter instead of through their server such as denny’s and sizzler may also feature items here retail businesses including hardware stores auto parts stores hobby stores and others place their own lowticket items around their checkout locations tobacco companies focus much of their advertising around the point of sale although their displays and advertisements are subject to more legal regulations than other products brands can purchase display space at a retailer’s pos or even use the pos system software to promote their product for example hellman’s designed a program that printed recipes featuring hellman’s mayonnaise and other products purchased at the same time on customers’ receipts which led to an increase in sales as customers put their mayonnaise to further use starbucks is a particularly good example of pos marketing insofar as they have lowticket merchandise on display there a pos software that facilitates suggestive selling and a receipt program that encourages repeat business nonprofit organizations and causes can sell paper plaques also called pinups icons or mobiles at the point of sale which visually represent a donation made and offer the customer a social reward for donating such as putting the donator’s name on display for what kinds of customers is point of sale marketing effective capturing customer interest at the pos lowticket items novelty and gift items sale items the promoted items can even be perpetually “on sale” eye level is “buy level” point of sale merchandise tends to focus on lowticket impulse items which can easily be added to other purchases they appeal most to impulse customers who aren’t particularly loyal to a brand brand shoppers will typically find their preferred brand on its normal shelf instead of discovering it at the pos while different types of retailers may have very different customer bases pos displays tend to have a universal appeal despite representing an unplanned buy pos items are particularly attractive to pricesensitive customers as they’re commonly displayed as “deal” items whether that means being on sale or “new in store” or an “item of the week” see also promotional marketing how is a point of sale marketing campaign developed retailers have many options available to them in point of sale marketing so first they need to identify what goals they wish to accomplish do they want to move overstocked items increase visibility of new items highlight a particular product line or serve seasonal interests types of pos displays counter displays—typically small as they must never block lineofsight between the clerk and the customer floor displays “dumps”—commonly constructed from card stock shelf talkers—small signage that appears next to the product on the shelf posters—when wall space is present video and digital signage—suspended above customers in line next they must consider the physical layout of their stores including the customers’ paths to the pos supermarkets tend to have one line per register while other retailers such as best buy or barnes and noble commonly use one line for several registers this allows businesses to display different merchandise all along the lines attracting consumers looking for distractions while waiting in line product manufacturers must also consider spatial restrictions when designing pos displays often sending agents to visit various stores to recommend variations in a displays these agents will also negotiate with retailers for display space—a scarce resource as there are far more products available for display than space allows this negotiation may take place with individual store owners or with corporate offices which control many stores fastfood restaurants and other businesses in which customers’ purchase decisions are made at the pos may establish policies and training that promotes suggestive selling in which the clerk recommends additional items for purchase additionally they may purchase pos software that incorporates this directly into the purchase for example by providing scripted lines to the clerk based upon what items have been rung up see also onetoone marketing what career titles work with point of sale marketing strategies marketing manager what do they do negotiate point of sale campaigns
