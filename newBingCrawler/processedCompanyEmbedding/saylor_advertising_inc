activitiescreating products and services that serve consumerscommunicating a clear value propositiondelivering products and services in a way that optimizes valueexchanging or trading value for those offeringsmany people incorrectly believe that marketing and advertising are the same thing  in reality advertising is but one of the many tools used in marketing which is the process by which firms determine which products to offer how to price those products and to whom the products should be made availablein this course you will learn about the marketing process and examine the range of marketing decisions that an organization must make in order to sell its products and servicesyou will also learn how to think like a marketer discovering that the focus of marketing has always been on the customer  you will begin to intuitively ask what does the customer need  what does the customer want  who is this customerwe will also explore the various ways in which marketing departments and independent agencies answer these questions – whether through research analysis or even trialanderror  once a company identifies its customer and product marketers must then determine the best way to capture the customer’s attention  capturing the customer’s attention may entail undercutting competitors on price aggressively marketing a product with promotions and advertising as with “as seen on tv” ads or specifically targeting ideal customers as with custom yacht building  the strategy a marketing firm chooses for a particular product is absolutely vital to the success of the product  the
