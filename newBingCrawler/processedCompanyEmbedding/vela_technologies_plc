subscribed for  placing shares at the placing price following the issue of  placing shares antony laiker will be interested in  ordinary shares representing  per cent of the issued share capital of

the aim rules for companies brent fitzpatrick the independent director for the purposes of the participation by antony laiker in the placing considers having consulted with the companys nominated adviser allenby capital limited that the terms of the participation in the placing by antony laiker are fair and reasonable insofar as the companys shareholders are concerned   antony laiker executive director commented on the equity placing and proposed further investment in portr as an investor in early stage technology companies it is useful and important to have a solid supportive shareholder base that understand vela its investments and its strategy of investing in early stage technology companies that disrupt the way in which businesses operate this fundraising whilst more dilutive than we would have liked gives vela the opportunity to invest further in portr which we understand is now experiencing very strong growth in its business following the recent agreements with heathrow and gatwick portrs model is very scalable and therefore has the potential to grow strongly from here as travelers recognise and get used to what is a shift in the way in which passengers get their luggage to and from home office or hotel and their destination at an affordable cost testament to this is the high percentage of repeat customers that portr sees using the airportr service velas investment in portr will be valued at £ million on completion of the portr fundraising compared to £ at the time of the previous portr fundraising last year and now broadly equates to the market capitalisation of vela as of yesterday in addition vela owns stakes in  further investments which based on the balance sheet disclosed in our interim results in december  will give shareholders some guidance as to the value of these investments the board would therefore reiterate previous statements that based either on valuation events or the market value or original cost of portfolio investments the board of vela believes the underlying value of the portfolio is significantly higher than the value attributed to vela at this current time for further information please contact vela technologies plc brent
