climbed  year over year on a constant currency basis adjusted net income grew  year over year to  million or  per diluted share adjusted ebitda increased   at constant currency to  million  by comparison both the top and bottom lines were above expectations criteos guidance provided last quarter called for lower revenue extac of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda of  million to  million cash flow from operations was  million down from  million this time last year while free cash flow declined to  million from  million both figures were negatively affected by an unusual change in working capital on higher income tax paid criteo cfo benoit fouilland explained during the subsequent conference call that the working capital pattern we saw in q  specifically on the payable side
