bank accounts of its subsidiaries located outside the united states the company currently plans to use this cash to fund its ongoing foreign operations if the company were to repatriate the cash held by its subsidiary located outside the united states it may incur tax liabilities management feels that the company has an adequate amount of cash to operate the company for at least twelve months from december   despite our present liquidity position however if we fail to achieve the level of revenues that we forecast including as a result of an extended downturn or lower than expected demand for our products and services we could generate less cash flow than we have budgeted under those circumstances our cash on hand and funds from operations may not be sufficient to fund our operations or pursue strategic transactions and we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing there is no assurance however that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all at december   the company had outstanding debt of  this debt represents the remaining balance of the borrowings the company made in connection with the acquisition of symon as discussed above and the
