due to the fact that revenues for the period april  through december   include advertising revenues for the successor company while revenues for the year ended january   include only the revenues of the predecessor company revenues for the period april  through december   have also been reduced by  to reflect the adjustment to market value of the companys deferred revenue accounts at the

advertising revenues which were almost exclusively generated in north america the rmg media networks business unit was not included in operations for the year ended january   we believe that a better basis for comparing the companys financial results can be found in note  to the companys audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing that provides unaudited proforma

from  for the year ended january   the lower gross margin was primarily attributable to the following  revenues for the period april  through december   have been reduced by  to reflect the amortization of the companys customer order backlog from the date of acquisition in accordance with us gaap  advertising revenue which comprised  of total revenues for the period april  through december   generates a lower gross margin than the average gross margin for the companys other products and services as previously noted there was no advertising revenue in the year ended january    the company also had a lower gross margin on product sales in the period ended december   because of sales mix operating expenses operating expenses totaled  and  for the period april  through

december   despite our present liquidity position however if we fail to achieve the level of revenues that we forecast including as a result of an extended downturn or lower than expected demand for our products and services we could generate less cash flow than we have budgeted under those circumstances our cash on hand and funds from operations may not be sufficient to fund our operations or pursue strategic transactions and we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing there is no assurance however that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all at
