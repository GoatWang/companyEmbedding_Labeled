to create content sites directed at ecommerce verticals like housewares electronics and other consumer products   the operations of the joint venture began in april of  and currently are in a testing phase   competition   the online advertising industry is constantly evolving changes rapidly and is highly competitive one of the major factors contributing to this competitive environment is that providers of all online advertising formats compete for a share of the advertisers’ limited advertising budgets the large search engines such as yahoo google and bing often receive the biggest portion of the search marketing budget in addition social networks such as facebook and linkedin are rapidly scaling their advertising capabilities with greater capital and technical resources and greater brand recognition the larger brands are often first priority in the mind of the advertiser agency or buyer            we compete on two main fronts  attracting and growing our base of advertising customers to purchase our online advertising products and to incorporate their key words into our search advertising network and  attracting and maintaining distribution network partners to incorporate their search queries into our search advertising network the basis on which we compete differs among the two fronts in addition while online advertising continues to grow year over year customers’ online advertising budgets are in competition with advertising in other media such as television radio and print    customers   for the year ended december   our largest customer accounted for  of our revenue for the year ended december   our largest customer accounted for  of our revenue   intellectual property   we rely on a combination of patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights our trademarks include looksmart ® clickable ® and syncapse ® we have an issued patent on our search engine technology and have patents on various aspects of our ad delivery and search technologies    government regulations   we are subject to a number of domestic state and federal laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition because of the increasing popularity of the internet and the growth of online services laws relating to user privacy freedom of expression content advertising information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption   in the us state and federal laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their consumers and the liability of providers of online advertiser’s ads and activities are currently being tested by a number of claims which include actions for defamation libel invasion of privacy and other data protection claims tort unlawful activity copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched by consumers the advertisements shown to consumers or the content generated by consumers likewise other federal laws could have an impact on our business for example the children’s online protection act and the children’s online privacy protection act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors in addition the protection of children from sexual predators act of  requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances   in addition the application of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our search advertising customers including for example distribution of pharmaceuticals adult content online gambling financial services alcohol or firearms can be unclear application of these laws in an unanticipated manner could expose us to substantial liability and restrict our ability to deliver services to our customers    research product development and technical operations expense   research product development and technical operations expense includes all costs related to the continued operation development and enhancement of our clickable and adcenter platforms our product development and technical operations expense for clickable net of capitalized software development costs was approximately  million during the year ended december   and approximately  million during the year ended december   our product development and technical operations expense for adcenter net of capitalized software development costs was approximately  million during the year ended december   and approximately  million during the year ended december     the company reviews assets for evidence of impairment annually at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable the impairment review requires the company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations and changes in competition    the fair value of the longlived assets was derived based on level  inputs which are based on significant inputs that are not observable the fair value of the capitalized software longlived assets was determined using an income approach based on expected future cash flows and market considerations the fair value of the computer equipment furniture and fixtures software and leasehold improvements longlived assets was determined using a market approach based on comparable fair values of similar assets   the company expects to continue to invest in internally developed software and other technology initiatives            employees   as of december   we had  total employees and  fulltime employees we believe our employee relations to be good   available information   our website wwwlooksmartcom provides access without charge to our annual report on form

of the following events described as a company risk factor actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and our investors could lose all or part of their investment additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations   risks related to our business   our financial results are highly concentrated in the online search advertising business if we are unable to grow online search advertising revenues and find alternative sources of revenue our financial results will suffer   search advertising accounted for substantially all of our revenues for the years ended december   and  our success depends upon search advertising customers choosing to use and distribution network partners choosing to distribute our search advertising networks products decisions by search advertising customers and distribution network partners not to adopt our products at projected rates or changes in market conditions may adversely affect the use or distribution of search advertisements because of our revenue concentration in the online search advertising business such shortfalls or changes could have a negative impact on our financial results also many of our products are offered to website publishers who use them to display or generate revenue from their online advertisements if we are unable to generate significant revenue from our online advertising business or related business models under development or if market conditions adversely affect the use or distribution of online advertisements generally or for some of our larger customers specifically our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity will suffer   our largest category of customers have historically been intermediaries the majority of whom purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search engine providers in  we experienced a further decrease in revenues due to loss of intermediary business   we operate in a large online search advertising ecosystem serving ads that target user queries on partner sites we operate in the middle of this ecosystem acquiring search queries from a variety of sources and matching them with the keywords of our search advertising customers our largest category of customers has historically been intermediaries the majority of which purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search engine providers the intermediary business model experienced a significant change in the fourth quarter of   since then we have seen our revenues from intermediaries decreasing from prior levels and have ceased business with a number of our intermediary customers we do not expect significant future revenue growth in this area if we are unable to identify and exploit alternative sources of profitable revenue our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity will suffer   our future success depends on sales to and the management of international customers   a portion of our revenue is derived from sales to international customers who are headquartered internationally however our business with them is primarily us based and our transactions are primarily in us dollars            managing our growing group of customers outside the us presents various challenges including but not limited to   ● economic and political conditions   ● longer payment cycles   ● differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions   ● our ability to develop relationships with local accounts   ● compliance with united states and international laws and regulations   ● fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and   ● our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business    to date foreign exchange exposure from sales has not been material to our operations our activities with customers outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies our business could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop if we do not receive additional traffic suitable for our foreign accounts or if regulations governing our international businesses change   we rely primarily on our distribution network partners to generate quality search queries and display advertisements that generate paid clicks if we are unable to maintain or expand the scope and quality of this network our ability to generate revenue may be seriously harmed   the success of our online search advertisement products depends in large part on the size and quality of our distribution network of search queries we may be unable to maintain or add partners of satisfactory quality in our distribution network at reasonable revenuesharing rates if at all if we lose any significant portion of our distribution network we would need to find alternative sources of quality click traffic to replace the lost paid clicks in the past we have lost portions of our distribution network and chose to remove those with poor quality although alternate sources of click traffic are currently available in the market they may not be available at reasonable prices or may be of unacceptable quality there is significant competition among advertising networks to sign agreements with traffic providers we may be unable to negotiate and sign agreements with quality traffic providers on favorable terms if at all in order to attract higher quality traffic we may have to pay high traffic acquisition costs which may adversely affect our gross margin and other financial results if we are unable to attract higher quality traffic or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in maintaining and expanding our distribution network then our ability to generate revenue may be seriously harmed   we generated net losses in  and  have had losses in the past and may have further losses in the future failure to maintain operating profitability could harm our business and result in a decline in our stock price   we had a net loss of  million in  and  million in   we may be unable to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend on our ability to generate additional revenue and contain our expenses in order to generate additional revenue we will need to expand our network of distribution network partners increase the amount our search advertising customers spend on our advertising network expand our advertiser base experience an increase in paid clicks across our network and publisher products and develop and implement successful new digital advertising revenue generating models we may be unable to accomplish some or any of these goals because of the risks identified in this report or for unforeseen reasons also we may be unable to contain our costs due to the need to make revenue sharing payments to our distribution network partners to invest in product development and to market our products historically our operating expenses have increased in proportion to our revenue operating expenses may increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that our revenue grows and as we increase headcount particularly our sales and technologyrelated headcount incur general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company and expand our facilities additionally our acquisitionrelated costs may increase if we pursue additional acquisition opportunities although we expect to achieve operating efficiencies and greater leverage of resources as we grow because of the foregoing factors and others outlined in this report we may be unable to achieve profitability in the future which could result in a decline in our stock price            if we experience decreases to our match rate andor revenueperclick or we are unable to rebuild our match rate andor revenueperclick our financial results may suffer   we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future decreases in our average revenueperclick “rpc” and average match rate which is the rate at which our paid listings are matched against search queries from distribution network partners future decreases in rpc or average match rate may occur for a variety of reasons including a change in customer mix the erosion of our advertiser base a reduction in average advertiser spend a reduction in the number of listings purchased by search advertising customers a lower number of bids on keywords changes in the composition of our distribution network or for other reasons if our rpc or average match rate falls for any reason or if we are unable to grow our rpc and average match rate then we may be unable to achieve our financial projections and our stock price would likely suffer   our growth depends on our ability to retain and grow our search advertising customer base if our search advertising customer base and average search advertising customer spend falls our financial results will suffer   our growth depends on our ability to build a search advertising customer base that corresponds with the characteristics of our distribution network our distribution network which currently consists of a diversified set of distribution sources may change as new distribution sources are added and old distribution sources are removed search advertising customers may view these changes to the distribution network negatively and existing or potential search advertising customers may elect to purchase fewer or no advertisements for display on our distribution network if this occurs it is likely that our average rpc and average match rate may decline and our stock price would likely suffer   we have launched a solution that is dependent on our customers’ use of search advertising any decrease in the use of search advertising or our inability to further penetrate mobile social and display advertising channels would harm our business growth prospects operating results and financial condition   we expect that search advertising will become a channel increasingly used by our customers in the foreseeable future should our customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of search advertising the demand for our solutions may decline which would harm our growth prospects operating results and financial condition   if we cannot increase the capacity of our advertising technology platform to meet advertiser demand our business will be harmed   we must be able to continue to increase the capacity of our technology platforms in order to support substantial increases in the number of advertisers to support an increasing variety of advertising formats and to maintain a stable service infrastructure and reliable service delivery for advertising campaigns if we are unable to efficiently and effectively increase the scale of our advertising platforms to support and manage a substantial increase in the number of advertisers while also maintaining a high level of performance the quality of our services could decline and our reputation and business could be seriously harmed in addition if we are not able to support emerging advertising formats or services preferred by advertisers we may be unable to obtain new advertising clients or may lose existing advertising customers and in either case our revenue could decline   the market for digital advertising is relatively new and dependent on growth in various digital advertising channels if this market develops more slowly or differently than we expect our business growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected   the market for digital advertising products such as ours is relatively new and these products may not achieve or sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance while search and display advertising has been used successfully for several years marketing via new digital advertising channels such as social media is not as well established the future growth of our business could be constrained by the level of acceptance and expansion of emerging digital advertising channels as well as the continued use and growth of existing channels such as search and display advertising even if these channels become widely adopted advertisers and agencies may not make significant investments in solutions such as ours that help them manage their digital advertising spend across publisher platforms and advertising channels it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates customer demand for our platform the future growth rate and size of the digital advertising market or the entry of competitive products any expansion of the market for digital advertising management solutions depends on a number of factors including the growth of the digital advertising market the growth of social as an advertising channel and the cost performance and perceived value associated with digital advertising management solutions if our digital advertising products including those in the social media space do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for digital advertising caused by weakening economic conditions decreases in corporate spending or otherwise it could result in reduced usage which could decrease revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business   our business depends on our ability to maintain the quality of our advertiser and developer content   we must be able to ensure that our customers’ ads are not placed in publisher content that is unlawful or inappropriate likewise publishers rely upon us not to distribute ads that are unlawful or inappropriate if we are unable to ensure that the quality of our advertiser and publisher content does not decline as the number of advertisers and publishers we work with continues to grow then our reputation and business may suffer            if we are unable to attract new advertising customers and sell additional offerings to our existing customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected   to sustain or increase our revenue we must add new advertisers and encourage existing advertisers both of which are often represented by advertising agencies or other intermediaries to purchase additional offerings from us as the digital advertising industry matures and as competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that compete with or are perceived to compete with ours our ability to sell our solution to new and existing advertisers based on our offerings pricing technology platform and functionality could be impaired some advertisers that are repeat users of our solution tend to increase their spend over time conversely some advertisers that are newer to our solution tend to spend less than and may not return as frequently as advertisers who have used our solution for longer periods of time if we fail to retain or cultivate the spending of our newer lowerspending advertisers it will be difficult for us to sustain and grow our revenue from existing advertisers even with longtime advertisers we may reach a point of saturation at which we cannot continue to grow our revenue from those advertisers because of internal limits that advertisers may place on the allocation of their advertising budgets to digital media to particular campaigns to a particular provider or for other reasons not known to us if we are unable to attract new advertisers or obtain new business from existing advertisers our revenue growth and our business may be adversely affected    if we do not introduce new and upgraded products and services and successfully adapt to our rapidly changing industry our financial condition may suffer   the online search advertising industry continues to evolve and we will need to continue developing new and upgraded products and services and adapt to new business environments and competition in order to maintain and grow revenue and reach our profitability goals new search advertising technologies could emerge that make our services comparatively less useful or new business methods could emerge that divert web traffic away from our advertising network in addition competition from other web businesses may prevent us from attracting substantial traffic to our services we may inaccurately predict trends in the online search advertising market which could lead us to make investments in technologies and products that do not generate sufficient returns we may face platform and resource constraints that prevent us from developing upgraded products and services we may fail to successfully identify new products or services or fail to bring new products or services to market in a timely and efficient manner rapid industry change makes it difficult for us to accurately anticipate customer needs for our products particularly over longer periods   we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors because competition in our industry is intense and our competitors may offer solutions that are perceived by our customers to be more attractive than ours these factors could result in declining revenue or inability to grow our business   competition for our advertiser customers’ advertising budgets is intense we also expect competition to increase as the barriers to enter our market are low increased competition may force us to charge less for our solution or offer pricing models that are less attractive to us and decrease our margins our principal competitors include companies that offer demand side and data management platforms that allow advertisers to purchase inventory directly from advertising exchanges or other third parties and manage and analyze their own consumer data traditional advertising networks and advertising agencies themselves we compete with large companies that provide paid placement products paid inclusion products and other forms of search marketing as well as contextuallytargeted advertising products and other types of online advertisements we compete for search advertising customers on the basis of the quality and composition of our network the priceperclick “ppc” charged to search advertising customers the volume of clicks that we can deliver to search advertising customers tracking and reporting of campaign results customer service and other factors we also compete for distribution network partners and for ad placement on those partners’ sites on the basis of the relevance of our ads and the ppc charged to search advertising customers we also experience competition in offering our publisher products to website publishers some of our competitors have larger distribution networks and proprietary traffic bases longer operating histories greater brand recognition higher rpc better relevance and conversion rates or better products and services than we have   we compete with companies such as google which are significantly larger than us and have more capital to invest in their advertising businesses we also compete with inhouse solutions used by companies who choose to coordinate advertising across their own properties such as facebook twitter yahoo and pandora they or other companies that offer competing advertising solutions may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with their partners brand advertisers app developers or other parties thereby limiting our ability to promote our services and generate revenue competitors could also seek to gain market share from us by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers or by introducing new technology tools for developers moreover increased competition for online advertising space from developers could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to developers to acquire that advertising space            our business will suffer to the extent that our intermediary and advertiser customers purchase and sell advertising directly from each other or through other companies that are able to become intermediaries for example we are aware of companies that have substantial existing platforms for developers who had previously not heavily used those platforms for advertising campaigns these companies could compete with us to the extent they expand into advertising other companies such as large app developers with a substantial advertising business may decide to directly monetize some or all of their advertising space without utilizing our services other companies that offer analytics mediation exchange or other third party services may also become intermediaries between advertisers and publishers and thereby compete with us any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our services and could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share   we have previously derived a portion of our revenues from display advertising a decrease in the use of display advertising or our inability to further penetrate display search and social advertising channels would harm our business growth prospects operating results and financial condition   historically we have had customers use our solution for display advertising we expect that display advertising will continue to be a significant channel used by our customers recently the market for display advertising excluding social has been declining as overall display advertising growth has been driven by mobile social and video advertising should our customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of display advertising the demand for our display solution could decline in addition our failure to achieve market acceptance of our solution for social advertising would harm our growth prospects financial condition and results of operations   we do not have longterm commitments from our advertisers and we may not be able to retain advertisers or attract new advertisers that provide us with revenue that is comparable to the revenue generated by any advertisers we may lose   most of our advertisers do business with us by placing insertion orders for particular advertising campaigns if we perform well on a particular campaign then the advertiser or most often the advertising agency representing the advertiser may place new insertion orders with us for additional advertising campaigns we rarely have any commitment from an advertiser beyond the campaign governed by a particular insertion order as a result our success is dependent upon our ability to outperform our competitors and win repeat business from existing advertisers while continually expanding the number of advertisers for whom we provide services in addition it is relatively easy for advertisers and the advertising agencies that represent them to seek an alternative provider for their advertising campaigns because there are no significant switching costs agencies with whom we do the majority of our business often have relationships with many different providers each of whom may be running portions of the same advertising campaign because we generally do not have longterm contracts it may be difficult for us to accurately predict future revenue streams we cannot provide assurance that our current advertisers will continue to use our solution or that we will be able to replace departing advertisers with new advertisers that provide us with comparable revenue   if we serve our advertisers’ advertisements on undesirable websites our reputation will suffer which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations   our business depends in part on providing advertisers with a service that they trust we take action in an effort to prevent advertisements from appearing on undesirable websites we may distribute advertising to inventory that is objectionable to advertisers and we may lose the trust of our advertiser customers which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations   if our access to quality advertising inventory is diminished or if we fail to have access to new advertising inventory our revenue could decline and our growth could be impeded   we must maintain a consistent supply of attractive advertising inventory meaning the digital space on which we place advertising impressions including websites proprietary social networks such as facebook and mobile applications our success depends on our ability to secure quality inventory on reasonable terms across a broad range of advertising networks and exchanges including real time advertising exchanges such as google’s doubleclick ad exchange or appnexus suppliers of video and mobile inventory and social media platforms such as the facebook exchange known as fbx   the amount quality and cost of inventory available to us can change at any time our suppliers are generally not bound by longterm contracts as a result we cannot provide any assurance that we will have access to a consistent supply of quality inventory moreover the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from realtime advertising exchanges continues to increase which could put upward pressure on inventory costs if we are unable to compete favorably for advertising inventory available on realtime advertising exchanges or if realtime advertising exchanges decide not to make their advertising inventory available to us we may not be able to place advertisements at competitive rates or find alternative sources of inventory with comparable traffic patterns and consumer demographics in a timely manner furthermore the inventory that we can access through realtime advertising exchanges may be of low quality or misrepresented to us despite attempts by us and our suppliers to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks            suppliers control the bidding process for the inventory they supply and their processes may not always work in our favor for example suppliers may place restrictions on the use of their inventory including restrictions that prohibit the placement of advertisements on behalf of certain advertisers through the bidding process we may not win the right to deliver advertising to the inventory that we select and may not be able to replace inventory that is no longer made available to us   if we are unable to maintain a consistent supply of quality inventory for any reason our business advertiser retention and loyalty financial condition and results of operations would be harmed   if our access to quality inventory in social media is diminished or if we fail to acquire new advertising inventory in social media our growth could be impeded and our revenue could decline   if we are unable to compete favorably for advertising inventory on facebook’s fbx our social media offering may not be successful also we cannot provide assurance that facebook will continue to make its advertising inventory available to us upon reasonable terms or at all and we may not be able to replace the fbx advertising inventory with inventory that meets our advertisers’ specific goals with respect to social media in addition advertisers may prefer to work with companies that provide advertising on social media platforms other than fbx or that have a longer history of integration with social media platforms if we are unable to run advertising campaigns on the fbx platform integrate with social media platforms that may become available in the future or find alternative sources of quality social media inventory our business could be harmed     if mobile connected devices their operating systems or content distribution channels including those controlled by our competitors develop in ways that prevent our advertising campaigns from being delivered to their users our ability to grow our business will be impaired   our success in the mobile channel depends upon the ability of our technology platform to integrate with mobile inventory suppliers and provide advertising for most mobile connected devices as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the thousands of applications that are downloaded onto them the design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships these parties frequently introduce new devices and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices if our solution were unable to work on these devices or operating systems either because of technological constraints or because an operating system or app developer device maker or carrier wished to impair our ability to purchase inventory and provide advertisements our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed   if we do not deliver quality traffic that delivers value for advertisers then our advertisers and our advertising partners may pay us less for their listing or discontinue listing with us altogether   for our services to be successful we need to deliver consumers to advertisers’ websites that are valuable to such advertiser if we do not meet advertisers’ expectations by delivering quality traffic then our advertising partners may pay us less per click or cease doing business with us altogether which may adversely affect our business and financial results we compete with other web search services online publishers and hightraffic websites as well as traditional media such as television radio and print for a share of our advertisers’ total advertising expenditures many potential advertisers and advertising agencies have only limited experience advertising on the internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to search advertising acceptance of our advertising offerings among our advertisers and advertising partners will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the continued growth of commercial usage of the internet if we experience downward pricing pressure for our services in the future our financial results may suffer   we depend on publishers for advertising space to deliver our advertiser customers’ advertising campaigns and any decline in the supply of advertising inventory from these publishers could hurt our business   we depend on publishers both search and social media to provide us with space advertising inventory into which to distribute advertisements there is no contractually bound obligation to make advertising inventory available to us or our customers or to provide us with a consistent supply of advertising inventory furthermore there are tools that exist that parties could use which could result in pressure to increase the prices paid to publishers for that inventory or to otherwise block access to this inventory without which we would be unable to facilitate the distribution of ads on behalf of our advertiser customers            publishers can change the amount of inventory they make available to us at any time they may also change the price at which they offer inventory or they may elect to make advertising space available to our competitors who offer ads to them on more favorable economic terms in addition publishers may place significant restrictions on use of their advertising inventory these restrictions may prohibit ads from specific advertisers or specific industries or they could restrict the use of specified creative content or format publishers may also use a feebased or subscriptionbased business model to generate revenue from their content in lieu of or to reduce their reliance on ads   if publishers decide not to make advertising inventory available to us for any of these reasons decide to increase the price of inventory or place significant restrictions on our use of their advertising space we may not be able to replace this with inventory from other publishers that satisfy our requirements in a timely and costeffective manner if this happens our revenue could decline or our cost of acquiring inventory could increase   we do not have longterm agreements with our advertiser customers and we may be unable to retain key customers attract new customers or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us   our success requires us to maintain and expand our current advertiser customer relationships and to develop new relationships our contracts with our advertiser customers generally do not include longterm obligations requiring them to purchase our services and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty as a result we may have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams we cannot assure you that our advertiser customers will continue to use our services or that we will be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue if a major advertising customer representing a significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our platform or to cease using our platform altogether our revenue could be significantly reduced advertisers in general may shift their business to a competitor’s platform because of new or more compelling offerings strategic relationships technological developments pricing and other financial considerations or a variety of other reasons which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and harm our business   our acquisition of businesses and technologies may be costly and timeconsuming acquisitions may also dilute our existing stockholders   from time to time we evaluate strategic corporate development opportunities and when appropriate may make acquisitions of or significant investments in complementary companies or technologies to increase our technological capabilities expand our service offerings or extend the operating scale of our network businesses the pursuit of acquisitions whether or not completed as well as the completion of any acquisitions and their integration may be expensive and may divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of the company it may be difficult to retain key management and technical personnel of the acquired company during the transition period following an acquisition acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in dilution to our existing stockholders if we issue additional equity securities or increase our debt to pay for such acquisitions we may also be required to amortize significant amounts of intangible assets record impairment of goodwill in connection with future acquisitions or divest nonperforming assets at belowmarket prices all of which would adversely affect our operating results integration of acquired companies and technologies into the company is likely to be expensive timeconsuming and strain our managerial resources we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses or technologies and these transactions may not achieve anticipated business benefits   if we fail to make the right investment decisions in our offerings and technology platform we may not attract and retain advertisers and advertising agencies and our revenue and results of operations may decline   we compete for advertisers which are often represented by advertising agencies who want to purchase digital media for advertising campaigns our industry is subject to rapid changes in standards technologies products and service offerings as well as in advertiser demands and expectations we continuously need to make decisions regarding which offerings and technology to invest in to meet advertiser demand and evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements we may make wrong decisions regarding these investments for example we expect advertisers to award us credit or attribution for impressions that generate specific consumer purchases or responses using certain criteria such as last ad clicked or viewed our technology considers these attribution models and if new attribution models are introduced by advertisers we may need to make changes in our technology if new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings we may lose advertisers or advertisers may decrease their spending on our solution new advertiser demands superior competitive offerings or new industry standards could render our existing solution unattractive unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology platform or business model our failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or to anticipate advertiser demand could harm our business and our financial performance            our acquisition of syncapse and shopwiki could have a negative impact on our business or on our stock price   on september   we purchased the assets of syncapse inc “syncapse” and on december th  we acquired shopwiki this acquisition could disrupt our business in the following ways any of which could negatively affect our stock price or could harm our financial condition results of operations or business prospects   ● our customers and other third party business partners may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships as a result of our acquisition of syncapse whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements or otherwise   ● the attention of our management may be directed toward the integration of our businesses and related matters and may be diverted from our current business operations including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us and   ● current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with our company which might adversely affect our ability to retain recruit and motivate key personnel    we may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the acquisition including estimated cost savings and synergies or it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits   our realization of the benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of the assets of syncapse will depend in part on the integration and development of syncapse’s assets with ours however there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate a business using the syncapse’s assets profitably or integrate it successfully into our operations in a timely fashion or at all following the acquisition the size of the combined company’s business is significantly larger than our business was prior to the acquisition our future success as a combined company depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for our management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity the dedication of management resources to this integration could detract attention from our current daytoday business and we cannot assure you that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or other negative consequences as a result of these integration efforts these effects including but not limited to incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with integration of the two businesses or the failure of the business created using syncapse’s assets to perform as expected could harm our results of operations   if we fail to develop widespread brand awareness costeffectively our business may suffer   we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and attracting new customers we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a result of our marketing and brand promotion activities we may not generate customer awareness or increase revenues enough to offset the increased expenses we incur in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial marketing and sales expenses which are not offset by increased revenues we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is essential for broad customer adoption of our solution   failure to adequately manage our growth may seriously harm our business   we have in the past experienced and may again in the future experience significant growth in our business if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our services may suffer which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services our growth has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our managerial administrative operational and financial resources and our infrastructure our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively this will require us to among other things   ● implement additional management information systems   ● further develop our operating administrative legal financial and accounting systems and controls   ● hire additional personnel   ● develop additional levels of management within our company   ● locate additional office space   ● maintain close coordination among our engineering operations legal finance sales and marketing and client service and support organizations and            ● manage our expanding international operations    moreover as our sales increase we may be required to concurrently deploy our services infrastructure at multiple additional locations or provide increased levels of customization as a result we may lack the resources to deploy our services on a timely and costeffective basis failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver our mobile advertising platform in a timely fashion fulfill existing client commitments or attract and retain new clients   our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were unable to attract and retain key personnel in the future our business could be materially and adversely impacted   our success depends on our ability to identify attract retain and motivate highly skilled development technical sales and management personnel we have a limited number of key development technical sales and management personnel performing critical company functions and the loss of the services of any of our key employees particularly any of our executive team members or key technical personnel could adversely affect our business the combination of stock volatility of company stock and the company’s small market capitalization may not allow us to offer competitive equity based compensation to attract and retain key personnel    if we do not attract additional sales and technology talent we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives   our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate highly skilled managers and employees particularly employees with technical skills that enable us to deliver effective mobile advertising solutions and sales and client support representatives with experience in mobile and other digital advertising and strong relationships with brand advertisers and app developers competition for these employees in our industry is intense as a result we may be unable to attract or retain these management technical sales and client support personnel that are critical to our success resulting in harm to our key client relationships loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated recruitment and training costs the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals   we face capacity constraints on our software and infrastructure systems that may be costly and timeconsuming to resolve   we use proprietary and licensed software and databases to receive and analyze advertisements campaigns and budgets match search queries to advertising analyze webpage information to match advertising to relevant content integrate thirdparty ads detect invalid clicks serve ads in high volume and track analyze and report on advertising responses and campaigns any of these software systems may contain undetected errors defects or bugs or may fail to operate with other software applications the following developments may strain our capacity and result in technical difficulties with our service or the websites of our distribution network partners   ● customization of our matching algorithms and ad serving technologies   ● substantial increases in the number of queries to our database   ● substantial increases in the number of searches in our advertising databases or   ● the addition of new products or new features or changes to our products    if we experience difficulties with our software and infrastructure systems or if we fail to address these difficulties in a timely manner we may lose the confidence of search advertisers and distribution network partners our revenue may decline and our business could suffer in addition as we expand our service offerings and enter into new business areas we may be required to significantly modify and expand our software and infrastructure systems if we fail to accomplish these tasks in a timely manner our business will likely suffer            our inability to use software licensed from third parties or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights could disrupt our business   our technology platform incorporates software licensed from third parties including some software known as open source software which we use without charge although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by us or foreign courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our platform to our clients while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in the future we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all alternatively we may need to reengineer our platform or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our platform in addition the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such software to others on unfavorable license terms we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract discontinue sales in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts our inability to use third party software could result in disruptions to our business or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings which could impair our business   if we fail to maintain adequate security and supporting infrastructure as we scale our systems we may experience outages and disruptions of our services which could harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our revenue and results of operations   as we grow our business we expect to continue to further invest in technology services hardware and software including data centers network services storage and database technologies creating the appropriate support for our technology platform including big data and our computational infrastructure is expensive and complex and our execution could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks which in turn could diminish the quality of our services and our performance for advertisers the steps we take to increase the reliability integrity and security of our systems as they scale may be expensive and may not prevent system failures or unintended vulnerabilities resulting from the increasing number of persons with access to our systems complex interactions within our technology platform and the increasing number of connections with third party partners and vendors’ technology operational errors or failures or successful cyberattacks could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and new advertisers and other business partners which could harm our business in addition we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners such as the realtime advertising exchanges who we rely upon for access to inventory   our data center facility in phoenix arizona is vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error intentional bad acts earthquakes hurricanes floods fires war terrorist attacks power losses hardware failures systems failures telecommunications failures and similar events moreover while we have a disaster recovery plan in place we do not maintain a “hot failover” instance of our software platform permitting us to immediately switch over in the event of damage or service interruption at our data center the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism any outages or vandalism or other misconduct or a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services   any changes in service levels at the facility or any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems at or related to the facility that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues subject us to potential liability or result in reduced usage of our platform in addition some of our customer contracts require us to issue credits for downtime in excess of certain levels and in some instances give our customers the ability to terminate their subscriptions   our data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations   in our operations we store and transmit our proprietary information and information related to our customers our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations despite our security measures our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber or “cloud” storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers additionally misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business            errors or failures in our software and systems could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects   we depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of our technology platform to operate over  campaigns at any given time manage our inventory supply bid on inventory for each campaign serve or direct a third party to serve advertising collect process and interpret data to optimize campaign performance in real time and provide billing information to our financial systems if our technology platform cannot scale to meet demand or if there are errors in our execution of any of these functions on our platform then our business could be harmed because our software is complex undetected errors and failures may occur especially when new versions or updates are made we do not have the capability to test new releases or updates to our code on a small subset of campaigns which means that bugs or errors in code could impact all campaigns on our platform despite testing by us errors or bugs in our software have in the past and may in the future not be found until the software is in our live operating environment for example we may experience failures in our bidding system to recognize or respond to budget restrictions for campaigns resulting in overspending on media and we may in the future have failures in our systems that cause us to buy more media than our advertisers are contractually obligated to pay for which could be costly and harm our operating results errors or failures in our software could also result in negative publicity damage to our brand and reputation loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solution increased costs or loss of revenue loss of competitive position or claims by advertisers for losses sustained by them in such an event we may be required or choose to expend additional resources to help mitigate any problems resulting from errors in our software we may make errors in the measurement of our campaigns causing discrepancies with our advertisers’ measurements leading to a lack in confidence with us or on occasion the need for advertiser “makegoods” the standard credits given to advertisers for campaigns that have not been delivered properly alleviating problems resulting from errors in our software could require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or the cessation of our business any of which would adversely impact our financial position results of operations and growth prospects   software and components that we incorporate into our advertising platform may contain errors or defects which could harm our reputation and hurt our business   we use a combination of custom and third party software including open source software in building our advertising platforms although we test software before incorporating it into our platforms we cannot guarantee that all of the third party technology that we incorporate will not contain errors bugs or other defects we continue to launch enhancements to our mobile advertising platform and we cannot guarantee any such enhancements will be free from these kinds of defects if errors or other defects occur in technology that we utilize in our mobile advertising platform it could result in damage to our reputation and losses in revenue and we could be required to spend significant amounts of additional resources to fix any problems   the recent global financial crisis uncertainty in global economic conditions and out history of losses may have significant negative effects on our access to credit and our ability to raise capital   the recent global financial crisis which has included among other things significant reductions in and heightened credit quality standards for available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit substantial reductions andor fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide and concerns that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit when needed on acceptable terms or at all we may need to enter into additional credit facilities in the future to operate the business our history of operating losses may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing for our operations investing activities or financing activities this difficulty or inability could materially limit our business operations and adversely affect our business performance   if we do not comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreements our financial condition could be adversely affected   our credit facilities contain provisions that could limit our ability to among other things incur create or assume additional debt sell or otherwise dispose of our or any of our subsidiaries’ assets or consolidate or merge with or into or acquire the obligations or stock of or any other interest in another person in addition our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth and liquid assets our ability to meet those financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy these covenants if we fail to comply with these covenants we may be required to identify restricted cash equal to our outstanding capital lease balance if any plus our outstanding standby letter of credit “sblc” or in the event of default we may be required to pay the lenders cash in an amount equal to the capital lease balance if any is outstanding paying such cash balances could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition             risks related to operating in our industry   economic downturns and political and market conditions beyond our control could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of our current and prospective advertisers economic downturns or instability in political or market conditions may cause current or new advertisers to reduce their advertising budgets adverse economic conditions and general uncertainty about economic recovery are likely to affect our business prospects in particular uncertainty regarding the budget crisis in the united states may cause general business conditions in the united states and elsewhere to deteriorate or become volatile which could cause advertisers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our solution this could expose us to increased credit risk on advertiser orders which in turn could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the eu as well as continued geopolitical turmoil in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which could lead to reduced spending on advertising   cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in the economy in internet usage and in traditional retail shopping may have an effect on our business   both cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality may affect our business internet usage generally slows during the summer months and queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year these seasonal trends may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates   seasonal fluctuations in advertising activity could adversely affect our cash flows   our cash flows from operations could vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of our advertisers’ spending for example many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing to date these seasonal effects have been masked by our rapid revenue growth however if and to the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period as a result   if we fail to prevent detect and remove invalid search queries and clicks we could lose the confidence of our search advertisers thereby causing our business to suffer   invalid clicks are an ongoing problem for the internet search advertising industry and we are exposed to the risk of invalid clicks on customers’ text advertisements coming from within our distribution network invalid clicks occur when a person or robotic software causes a click on a paid listing to occur for some reason other than to view the underlying content invalid clicks are commonly referred to as “click fraud” we continue to invest significant time and resources in preventing detecting and eliminating invalid traffic from our distribution network however the perpetrators of click fraud have developed sophisticated methods to evade detection and we are unlikely to be able to completely detect and remove all invalid traffic from our search network   currently and in the past we have been subject to advertiser complaints and litigation regarding invalid clicks and we may be subject to search advertising customer complaints claims litigation or inquiries in the future we have from time to time credited invoices or refunded revenue to our customers due to invalid traffic and we expect to continue to do so in the future if our systems to detect invalid traffic are insufficient or if we find new evidence of past invalid clicks we may have to issue credits or refunds retroactively to our search advertisers and we may still have to pay revenue share to our distribution network partners this could negatively affect our profitability and hurt our brand if traffic consisting of invalid clicks is not detected and removed from our advertising network the affected search advertising customers may experience a reduced return on their investment in our online advertising because the invalid clicks will not lead to conversions for the search advertising customers this could lead the search advertisers to become dissatisfied with our products which could lead to loss of search advertising customers and revenue and could materially and adversely affect our financial results   we compete with many companies some of whom are more established and better capitalized than us   we compete with a variety of companies on a worldwide basis both through the internet and in traditional markets many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than us there are also few barriers to entry in our markets our competitors may develop services that are superior to or have greater market acceptance than our services for example many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than us these factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements our competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger client bases in addition current and potential competitors are making and are expected to continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative and in some cases exclusive relationships with significant companies or competitors to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive products and services             system failures could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose advertiser customers or advertising inventory   our success depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our own internal systems which we utilize to distribute and place ads monitor the performance of advertising campaigns and manage inventory of advertising space our revenue depends on the technological ability of our platforms to deliver ads and measure them on a per click basis sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide services to customers including technological failures affecting our ability to deliver ads quickly and accurately and to process users’ responses to ads could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our services to advertisers and reduce our revenue our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications failures power outages malicious human acts and natural disasters in addition any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not ultimately be successful in preventing system failures   any failure in the performance of our key production systems could materially and adversely affect our revenues   any system failure that interrupts our hosted products or services whether caused by computer viruses software failure power interruptions intruders hackers or other causes could harm our financial results for example our system for tracking and invoicing clicks is dependent upon a proprietary software platform if we lose key personnel or experience a failure of software this system may fail in such event we may be unable to track paid clicks and invoice our customers which would materially and adversely affect our financial results and business reputation moreover our services are governed by service level agreements that if not met require the payment of credits to our customers depending upon the level of service interruption   the occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at our principal headquarters or at a thirdparty data center could cause interruptions or delays in our business a loss of data could render us unable to provide some services our california facilities exist on or near known earthquake fault zones and a significant earthquake could cause an interruption in our services an interruption in our ability to serve advertisements track paid clicks bill and collect invoices and provide customer support would materially and adversely affect our financial results   our business and operations depend on internet service providers and third party technology providers and any failure or system downtime experienced by these companies could materially and adversely affect our revenues   our distribution network partners and search advertising customers depend on internet service providers online service providers and other third parties for access to our services these service providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages delays and other operating difficulties in the future the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our reputation brand and business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results   we have agreements with thirdparty click tracking and adserving technology providers we do not presently maintain fully redundant click tracking customer account and web serving systems at separate locations accordingly our operations depend on the ability of our data center to protect the systems in their data centers from system failures earthquake fire power loss water damage telecommunications failure hacking vandalism and similar events we cannot guarantee that our internet access will be uninterrupted errorfree or secure although we maintain property insurance and business interruption insurance such insurance may not protect against some risks and we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of a catastrophic system failure also if our thirdparty click tracking or adserving technology providers experience service interruptions errors or security breaches our ability to track realize and record revenue would suffer   we may face liability for claims related to our products and services and these claims may be costly to resolve   internet users search advertisers other customers and companies in the internet technology and media industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations related to defamation negligence personal injury breach of contract unfair advertising unfair competition invasion of privacy patent infringement or other claims lawsuits are filed against us from time to time as we enter foreign markets our potential liability could increase in addition we are obligated in some cases to indemnify our customers or distribution network partners in the event that they are subject to claims that our services infringe on the rights of others   litigating these claims could consume significant amounts of time and money divert management’s attention and resources cause delays in integrating acquired technology or releasing new products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all our insurance may not adequately cover claims of this type if at all if a court were to determine that some aspect of our services infringed upon or violated the rights of others we could be prevented from offering some or all of our services which would negatively impact our revenue and business for any of the foregoing reasons litigation involving our listings business and technology could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition            our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our services weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue   we regard the protection of our intellectual property which includes trade secrets patents copyrights trademarks domain names and patent applications as critical to our success we strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights as well as contractual restrictions we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure and use of our intellectual property and proprietary information however these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others   we seek patent protection for certain of our technologies and currently have  issued us patents we are also pursuing the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states effective trade secret copyright trademark domain name and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights we may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location we may over time increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and timeconsuming   we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future some of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties these licensees may take unauthorized actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation   monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property further we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitors may also independently develop similar technology in addition the laws of many countries such as china and india do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of european countries and the united states further the laws in the united states and elsewhere change rapidly and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features which could seriously reduce demand for our mobile advertising services in addition we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation litigation whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant can be expensive timeconsuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel which could harm our business whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us in addition litigation is inherently uncertain and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights   we could be subject to infringement claims that may be costly to defend result in the payment of settlements or damages or cause us to change the way we conduct our business   internet technology and media companies as well as patent holding companies often possess a significant number of patents further many of these companies and other parties are actively developing online advertising search indexing electronic commerce and other webrelated technologies as well as a variety of online business models and methods we believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies including but not limited to seeking patent protection as a result we may face claims of infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights held by others also as we expand our business acquire and maintain our customer base and develop new technologies products and services we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement claims in the event that there is a claim or determination that we infringe thirdparty proprietary rights such as patents copyrights trademark rights trade secret rights or other third party rights such as publicity and privacy rights we could incur substantial monetary liability be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements or be prevented from using the rights which could require us to change our business practices in the future and limit our ability to compete effectively we may also incur substantial expenses in defending against thirdparty infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims the occurrence of any of these results could harm our brand and negatively impact our operating results in addition many of our agreements with our customers partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims or determinations which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages             litigation regulation legislation or enforcement actions directed at or materially affecting us may adversely affect the commercial use of our products and services and our financial results   new lawsuits laws regulations and enforcement actions applicable to the online industry may limit the delivery appearance and content of our advertising or our publisher customers’ advertisers or otherwise adversely affect our business if such laws are enacted or if existing laws are interpreted to restrict the types and placements of advertisements we or our publishers’ customers can carry it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results for example in  the federal trade commission in response to a petition from a private organization reviewed the way in which search engines disclose paid placement or paid inclusion practices to internet consumers and issued guidance on what disclosures are necessary to avoid misleading consumers about the possible effects of paid placement or paid inclusion listings on the search results in  the united states department of justice issued statements indicating its belief that displaying advertisements for online gambling might be construed as aiding and abetting an illegal activity under federal law in  the united states congress considered new laws regarding the sale of pharmaceutical products over the internet and the use of adware to distribute advertisements on the internet in  the federal trade commission proposed new regulations relating to online behavioral targeting moreover as we enter into foreign markets we may become subject to additional regulation and legislation if any new law or government agency were to require changes in the labeling delivery or content of our advertisements or if we are subject to legal proceedings regarding these issues it may reduce the desirability of our services or the types of advertisements that we can run and our business could be materially and adversely harmed in addition many of our agreements with our customers partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain claims related to online advertising laws regulations and enforcement actions which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages   in addition legislation or regulations including compliance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  “section ” present ongoing compliance risks and a failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could materially harm our business as we continue our section  compliance efforts we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting we may be unable to remediate any of these matters in a timely fashion andor our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our remediation efforts such failures could impact our ability to record process summarize and report financial information and could impact market perception of the quality of our financial reporting which could adversely affect our business and our stock price   the company is involved from time to time in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty the company does not expect resolution of these matters to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise however an unfavorable resolution of a matter could depending on its amount and timing materially affect its results of operations cash flows or financial position in a future period regardless of the outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on the company because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors   activities of our advertiser customers could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us   our advertiser customers’ promotion of their products and services may not comply with federal state and local laws including but not limited to laws and regulations relating to mobile communications failure of our customers to comply with federal state or local laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws we may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads we deliver if the artwork text or other content involved violates copyrights trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory unfair and deceptive or otherwise in violation of applicable laws although we generally receive assurance from our advertisers that their ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights trademarks or other intellectual property included in an ad and although we are normally indemnified by the advertisers a third party or regulatory authority may still file a claim against us any such claims could be costly and timeconsuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation further if we are exposed to legal liability as a result of the activities of our advertiser clients we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties redesign our business methods discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend significant resources    our business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection   in the course of providing our services we transmit and store information related to the ads we place federal state and international laws and regulations can govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we collect across our advertising platform we strive to comply with all applicable laws regulations policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection however it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with us federal state or international laws including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others we are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our industry alleging various violations of privacyrelated laws any such proceedings could hurt our reputation force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings distract our management increase our costs of doing business adversely affect the demand for our services and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability we may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our clients from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of providing our services            the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices for example in early  the state of california entered into an agreement with several major mobile app platforms under which the platforms have agreed to require mobile apps to meet specified standards to ensure consumer privacy subsequently in january  the state of california released a series of recommendations for privacy best practices for the mobile industry in january  a california law also became effective amending the required disclosures for online privacy policies it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the united states and internationally or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways that would affect our business   as we expand our operations globally compliance with regulations that differ from country to country may also impose substantial burdens on our business in particular the european union has traditionally taken a broader view as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy regulations in addition individual eu member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of the regulations which has resulted in variation of privacy standards from country to country in january  the european commission announced significant proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework including changes in obligations of data controllers and processors the rights of data subjects and data security and breach notification requirements the eu proposals if implemented may result in a greater compliance burden if we deliver ads to mobile device users in europe complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy   privacyrelated regulation of the internet could limit the ways we currently collect and use personal information which could decrease our advertising revenues or increase our costs   internet user privacy has become an issue both in the united states and abroad the united states congress and federal trade commission are considering new legislation and regulations to regulate internet privacy the federal trade commission and government agencies in some states and countries have investigated some internet companies and lawsuits have been filed against some internet companies regarding their handling or use of personal information any laws imposed to protect the privacy of internet consumers may affect the way in which we collect and use personal information we could incur additional expenses if new laws or court judgments in the united states or abroad regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if any agency chooses to investigate our privacy practices   we along with some of our distribution network partners or search advertising customers retain information about our consumers if others were able to penetrate the network security of these user databases and access or misappropriate this information we and our distribution network partners or search advertising customers could be subject to liability these claims may result in litigation our involvement in which regardless of the outcome could require us to expend significant time and financial resources in addition many of our agreements with our customers partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain claims related to privacy laws regulations and enforcement actions which could increase our costs in defending such claims and damages   legislation and regulation of online businesses including privacy and data protection regimes could create unexpected costs subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures or cause us to change our technology platform or business model which could have a material adverse effect on our business   government regulation could increase the costs of doing business online us and foreign governments have enacted or are considering legislation related to online advertising and we expect to see an increase in legislation and regulation related to advertising online the use of geolocation data to inform advertising the collection and use of anonymous internet user data and unique device identifiers such as ip address or unique mobile device identifiers and other data protection and privacy regulation recent revelations about bulk online data collection by the national security agency and news articles suggesting that the national security agency may gather data from cookies placed by internet advertisers to deliver interest based advertising may further interest governments in legislation regulating data collection by commercial entities such as advertisers and publishers and technology companies that serve the advertising industry such legislation could affect the costs of doing business online and could reduce the demand for our solution or otherwise harm our business financial condition and results of operations for example a wide variety of provincial state national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data while we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data such as name email address address phone numbers social security numbers credit card numbers financial or health data we may obtain information that are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation evolving and changing definitions of personal data within the eu the united states and elsewhere could cause us in the future to change our business practices or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations are evolving and could result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions while we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect use and disclose in the operation of our business and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to such information such measures may not always be effective in addition while we take steps to avoid collecting personally identifiable information about consumers we may inadvertently receive this information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of delivering advertising our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect personal data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of our officers and public censure claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid could harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solution by current and future advertisers and advertising agencies            if the use of “third party cookies” is rejected by internet users restricted or otherwise subject to unfavorable regulation our performance could decline and we could lose advertisers and revenue   advertisers and our partners use “cookies” small text files to gather important data in the delivery of advertisements these cookies are placed through an internet browser on an internet user’s computer and correspond to a data set these cookies are known as “third party” cookies because of a lack of a direct relationship with the internet user these cookies collect anonymous information such as when an internet user views an ad clicks on an ad or visits one of our advertiser customer’s websites on mobile devices there may also be location based information about the user’s device these cookies are used to help achieve our advertiser customer’s campaign goals to help ensure that the same internet user does not unintentionally see the same advertisement too frequently to report aggregate information to advertisers regarding the performance of their advertising campaigns and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity throughout our network of inventory data from cookies are also used to help decide whether to bid on and how much to bid on an opportunity to place an advertisement in a certain location at a given time in front of a particular internet user a lack of data associated with cookies may detract from the ability to make decisions about which inventory to purchase for an advertiser’s campaign and undermine the effectiveness of our solution   cookies may easily be deleted or blocked by internet users all of the most commonly used internet browsers including chrome firefox internet explorer and safari allow internet users to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers internet users can also delete cookies from their computers at any time some internet users also download “ad blocking” software that prevents cookies from being stored on a user’s computer if more internet users adopt these settings or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently do our business could be harmed in addition the safari browser blocks cookies by default and other browsers may do so in the future unless such default settings in browsers were altered by internet users we would be able to set fewer of our cookies in browsers which could adversely affect our business in addition companies such as google have publicly disclosed their intention to move away from cookies to another form of persistent unique identifier or id to indicate internet users in the bidding process on advertising exchanges if companies do not use shared ids across the entire ecosystem this could have a negative impact on our ability to find the same anonymous user across different web properties and reduce the effectiveness of our solution   in addition in the european union or eu directive ec commonly referred to as the “cookie directive” directs eu member states to ensure that accessing information on an internet user’s computer such as through a cookie is allowed only if the internet user has given his or her consent we may not be able to develop or implement additional tools that compensate for the lack of data associated with cookies moreover even if we are able to do so such additional tools may be subject to further regulation time consuming to develop or costly to obtain and less effective than our current use of cookies   potential “do not track” standards or government regulation could negatively impact our business by limiting access to the anonymous user data that informs the advertising campaigns we facilitate and as a result could degrade our performance for our customers   as the use of cookies has received ongoing media attention over the past three years some government regulators and privacy advocates have suggested creating a “do not track” standard that would allow internet users to express a preference independent of cookie settings in their web browser not to have their website browsing recorded all the major internet browsers have implemented some version of a “do not track” setting microsoft’s internet explorer  includes a “do not track” setting that is selected “on” by default however there is no definition of “tracking” no consensus regarding what message is conveyed by a “do not track” setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a “do not track” preference it is possible that we could face competing policy standards or standards that put our business model at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that collect data from internet users standards that reduce the effectiveness of our solution or standards that require us to make costly changes to our solution the federal trade commission has stated that it will pursue a legislative solution if the industry cannot agree upon a standard the “donottrack online act of ” was introduced in the united states senate in february  if a “do not track” web browser setting is adopted by many internet users and the standard either imposed by state or federal legislation or agreed upon by standard setting groups requires us to recognize a “do not track” signal and prohibits the use of nonpersonal data as currently done then that could hinder growth of advertising and content production on the web generally and limit the quality and amount of data we are able to store and use which would cause us to change our business practices and adversely affect our business            our business involves the use transmission and storage of confidential information and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational harm and monetary damages   we may at times collect store and transmit information of or on behalf of our clients that may include certain types of confidential information that may be considered personal or sensitive and that are subject to laws that apply to data breaches we believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts to protect this information if such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed most states have enacted data breach notification laws and in addition to federal laws that apply to certain types of information such as financial information federal legislation has been proposed that would establish broader federal obligations with respect to data breaches we may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed the unauthorized disclosure of information may result in the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships or a reduction in client confidence and usage of our services we may also be subject to litigation alleging the improper use transmission or storage of confidential information which could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue   online commerce security risks including security breaches identity theft service disrupting attacks and viruses could harm our reputation and the conduct of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results   a fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications is the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks although we have developed and use systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches our security measures may not prevent security breaches or identity theft that could harm our reputation and business currently a significant number of our customers provide credit card and other financial information and authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us we rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication to effect secure transmission of confidential information including customer credit card numbers advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data in addition any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user’s password could access the user’s transaction data an increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security any compromise of our security could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of litigation and possible liability the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches   additionally our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions and we have experienced “denialofservice” type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches disruptions in our services and damage caused by viruses and other attacks could cause a loss of user confidence in our systems and services which could lead to reduced usage of our products and services and materially adversely affect our business and financial results   our data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations   in our operations we store and transmit our proprietary information and information related to our customers our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations despite our security measures our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber or “cloud” storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers additionally misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business            new tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our search service and our financial results   tax authorities at the international federal state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce new or revised state tax regulations may subject us or our search advertising customers to additional state sales income and other taxes we cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales income or other taxes on commerce over the internet new or revised taxes and in particular sales taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over the internet any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations   risks related to the capital market    our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for many reasons which may make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investors’ and analysts expectations negatively affecting our stock price   our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control because our business is changing and evolving rapidly our historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include without limitation   ● changes in the composition and size of our advertiser network customer base   ● changes in composition of our adcenter customer base   ● the seasonal nature of our customers’ spending on digital advertising campaigns   ● the pricing of advertising inventory or of other thirdparty services   ● changes in our distribution network particularly the gain or loss of key distribution network partners or changes in the implementation of search results on partner websites   ● changes in the intermediary business model which affect the entire online search advertising ecosystem   ● changes in the number of search advertising customers who do business with us or the amount of spending per customer   ● the introduction of new technologies product or service offerings by our competitors   ● changes in our customers’ advertising budget allocations agency affiliations or marketing strategies   ● the revenueperclick we receive from search advertising customers or other factors that affect the demand for and prevailing prices of internet advertising and marketing services   ● changes to our traffic acquisition costs related to our advertiser network including changes to the economic prospects of our advertisers generally which could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities and increase the time or costs required to complete sales with advertisers   ● changes and uncertainty in the regulatory environment for us or our advertisers   ● changes in the availability of advertising inventory through realtime advertising exchanges or in the cost to reach end consumers through digital advertising   ● changes in our capital expenditures as we acquire the hardware equipment and other assets required to support our business            ● costs related to the acquisition of people business or technologies and   ● systems downtime on our advertiser network our website or the websites of our distribution network partners   due to the above factors we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on past financial results as an indicator of our future performance if our financial results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the market price of our securities would likely decline   our stock price is extremely volatile and such volatility may hinder investors’ ability to resell their shares for a profit or avoid a loss   the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years and the stock prices of internet companies have been extremely volatile the low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect its liquidity and reduce the number of market makers andor large investors willing to trade in our common stock making wider fluctuations in the quoted price of our common stock more likely to occur you should evaluate our business in light of the risks uncertainties expenses delays and difficulties associated with managing and growing a business in a relatively new industry many of which are beyond our control   our stock price may fluctuate and you may not be able to sell your shares for a profit as a result of a number of factors including without limitation   ● developments concerning proprietary rights including patents by us or a competitor   ● announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions commercial relationships joint ventures or capital commitments   ● introductions of new services by us or our competitors   ● enactment of new government regulations affecting our industry   ● changes in the market valuations of internet companies in general and comparable companies in particular   ● quarterly fluctuations in our operating results   ● the termination or expiration of our distribution agreements   ● our potential failure to meet our forecasts or analyst expectations on a quarterly basis   ● the relatively thinly traded volume of our publicly traded shares which means that small changes in the volume of trades may have a disproportionate impact on our stock price   ● the loss of key personnel or our inability to recruit experienced personnel to fill key positions   ● changes in ratings or financial estimates by analysts or the inclusionremoval of our stock from certain stock market indices used to drive investment choices   ● announcements of new distribution network partnerships technological innovations acquisitions or products or services by us or our competitors   ● the short selling of our stock   ● the sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur or   ● conditions or trends in the internet that suggest a decline in rates of growth of advertisingbased internet companies            in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources regardless of the merits or outcome of the case   we may need additional capital in the future to support our operations and if such additional financing is not available to us on reasonable terms or at all our liquidity and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted   although we believe that our working capital will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements for the foreseeable future unanticipated developments in the short term such as the entry into agreements which require large cash payments or the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows may necessitate additional financing we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to   ● fund the additional operations and capital expenditures   ● take advantage of favorable business opportunities including geographic expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies   ● develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure beyond current plans   ● develop new product and service offerings   ● take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or   ● respond to competitive pressures   the capital markets and in particular the public equity market for internet companies have historically been volatile it is difficult to predict when if at all it will be possible for internet companies to raise capital through these markets we cannot assure you that the additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution   we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value   we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any to fund the development and growth of our business in addition the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained   we will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the united states   as a public company listed in the united states we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including regulations implemented by the sec and stock exchanges may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards we fail to comply regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed   failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management   if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts which could result in a decline in our stock price            the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results could be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions if as a result our operating results fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts our stock price could decline significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation allowance for doubtful accounts accounting for internal use software and income taxes   concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions   as of december   our executive officers directors and current beneficial owners of  or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately  of our outstanding common stock these persons acting together are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions the interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders this concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring delaying or preventing a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock   we depend on key persons and the loss of any key person could adversely affect our operations    the future success of our business is dependent on our management team including michael onghai our chief executive officer and our professional team and employees if one or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions we may not be able to easily replace them and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel the loss of our key personnel could severely disrupt our business and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected furthermore since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel needed to achieve our business objectives in addition we do not have in place “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of the services of key members of our professional team or employees could negatively affect our financial performance    provisions of delaware corporate law and provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt   our charter and bylaws and provisions of delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt including an attempt that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders the issuance of preferred stock while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors these provisions along with section  of the delaware general corporation law prohibiting certain business combinations with an interested stockholder could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control   if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired   we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  the sarbanesoxley act of  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  and the rules and regulations of the nasdaq stock market the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting this requires that we incur substantial professional fees and internal costs related to our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts            we may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected   if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls in the future we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements and we may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective if that were to happen the

accounting policies which include estimates assumptions and judgments on the part of management we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include but are not limited to history and prior experience experience of other enterprises in the same industry new related events current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources these estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented actual results may differ from those estimates   the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report   use of estimates and assumptions   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue expenses and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include but are not limited to history and prior experience experience of other enterprises in the same industry new related events and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates   investments   we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of highquality corporate and government issuers all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered longterm investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle such securities are classified as shortterm investments these securities are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value   changes in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method   fair value of financial instruments   our estimates of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access   level  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg interest rates yield curves default rates etc or can be corroborated by observable market data            level  valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use   revenue recognition   our online search advertising revenue is composed of perclick fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with intermediaries the perclick fee charged for keywordtargeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer the company has profitsharing agreements with several customers that call for the sharing of profits and losses profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreement revenue from these profitsharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit   revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of privatelabeled versions of our adcenter platform   revenues associated with online advertising products including advertiser networks are generally recognized once collectability is established delivery of services has occurred all performance obligations have been satisfied and no refund obligations exist we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners these payments are called tac and are included in cost of revenue the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service   we also enter into agreements to provide privatelabeled versions of our products including licenses to the adcenter platform technology these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenuesharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application upfront fees minimum monthly fees and other license fees we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance other license fees over the term of the license and revenuesharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured   we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends   deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising   the company evaluates individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  revenue recognition  we test and record revenue accordingly   allowance for doubtful accounts   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments this valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as bankruptcy   concentrations credit risk and credit risk evaluation   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents investments and accounts receivable as of december   and  the company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial institution city national bank “cnb” and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument the company also invests in fully collateralized funds with maturities of less than two years these amounts exceed federally insured limits at december   and  the company has not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices            credit risk customer and vendor evaluation   accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses we apply judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and record a specific allowance in addition we record an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due historically such losses have been within our expectations   the following table reflects customers that accounted for more

inputs which are based on significant inputs that are not observable  the fair value of the capitalized software longlived assets was determined using an income approach based on expected future cash

institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and the institutions of whose debt instruments we hold our investment policy which is reviewed annually by our board of directors primarily emphasizes safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets  these balances may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the

cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current anticipated cash requirements through at least the next  months if not longer our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our services beyond the current quarter and changes in customer buying behavior also if the banking system or the financial markets continue to remain volatile our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected in addition we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures take advantage of favorable business opportunities develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure develop new product and service offerings take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond to competitive pressures in addition unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments including the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows may necessitate additional financing we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution            operating activities

of directors and officers we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal historically we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities   additionally in the normal course of business we have made certain guarantees indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions these indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to our customers and distribution network partners in connection with the sales of our products and indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease it is not possible to determine

backfill capability that allows publishers and portals to manage their advertiser relationships distribution channels and accounts   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   use of estimates and assumptions   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue expenses and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period the company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include but are not limited to history and prior experience experience of other enterprises in the same industry new related events and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates   investments   the company invests its excess cash primarily in debt instruments of highquality corporate and government issuers all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered longterm investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle such securities are classified as shortterm investments these securities are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value   changes in the value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the company recognizes realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s estimate of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access   level  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg interest rates yield curves default rates etc or can be corroborated by observable market data   level  valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use            revenue recognition   our online search advertising revenue is composed of perclick fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with intermediaries the perclick fee charged for keywordtargeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer the company has profitsharing agreements with several customers that call for the sharing of profits and losses profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreements revenue from these profitsharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit   revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of privatelabeled versions of our adcenter platform   revenues associated with online advertising products including advertiser networks are generally recognized once collectability is established delivery of services has occurred all performance obligations have been satisfied and no refund obligations exist we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners these payments are called tac and are included in cost of revenue the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service   we also enter into agreements to provide privatelabeled versions of our products including licenses to the adcenter platform technology these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenuesharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application upfront fees minimum monthly fees and other license fees we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance other license fees over the term of the license and revenuesharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured   we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends the allowance included in trade receivables net is insignificant at both december   and  respectively   deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising   the company evaluates individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  revenue recognition  we test and record revenue accordingly   allowance for doubtful accounts   the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as bankruptcy the allowance for doubtful accounts included in trade accounts receivable net is   million for each of the years ended december   and  bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense is insignificant and  and   million for the years ended december   and  respectively   concentrations credit risk and credit risk evaluation   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents investments and accounts receivable as of december   and  the company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial institution city national bank “cnb” and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument the company also invests in fully collateralized funds with maturities of less than two years these amounts exceed federally insured limits at december   and  the company has not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices            credit risk customer and vendor evaluation   accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for estimated credit losses the company applies judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on management’s evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and records a specific allowance in addition the company records an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due historically such losses have been within management’s expectations   the following table reflects customers that accounted for more than  of

developing and obtaining internaluse computer software and the payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internaluse computer software these costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a three year period once the project is placed in service   management exercises judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs which is generally three years the company expects to continue to invest in internally developed software although no such costs were capitalized in    restructuring charges   in  the predecessor completed the transaction with pyxis on october  th   restructuring costs associated with the transaction totaled  million in the year ended dec              in  the company entered into an agreement

estimates about its future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations and changes in competition   the fair value of the longlived assets was derived based on level  inputs which are based on significant inputs that are not observable  the fair value of the capitalized software longlived assets was determined using an income approach based on expected future cash flows and market considerations  the fair value of the computer equipment furniture and fixtures software and leasehold improvements longlived assets was determined using a market approach based on comparable fair values of similar assets   traffic acquisition costs   the

compensation   the company recognizes sharebased compensation costs for all sharebased payment transactions with employees including grants of employee stock options restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model our assumptions about stockprice volatility are based on the actual volatility of our publicly traded stock the riskfree interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant we estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in the company’s consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and  was  million and  million respectively which was related to stock grants options and employee stock purchases   forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of sharebased awards that will ultimately vest the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter based on historical rates   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of sharebased compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paidin capital

looksmart limited “predecessor” as a result of a reverse merger and spinoff transaction the “transaction” with pyxis tankers“pyxis”   the predecessor completed the transaction on october   for year to year comparisons when we refer to the year  we are referring to the predecessor   prior to the execution of the merger agreement the predecessor transferred all of its businesses assets and liabilities to the company in anticipation of the spinoff of company from the predecessor the company has assumed all liabilities of the predecessor and the liabilities of the predecessor’s former subsidiaries upon completion of the spinoff all of the predecessor’s shares of the common stock were cancelled and the company is  owned by the predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record

community platform during the three months ended september   the company determined that talkwheel had breached materially representations and warranties in the asset purchase agreement dated february   the “purchase agreement” governing the purchase of talkwheel’s assets as a result clickable terminated the purchase agreement and rescinded the transaction   principles of consolidation   the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of september   and december   and for the three months ended september   and  include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   unaudited interim financial information   the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of september   and for the three months ended september   and  reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair representation of the company’s financial position as of september   and the results of operations for the periods shown these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the consolidated balance sheet as of december   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” for complete financial statements the results of operations for the interim period ended september   is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year   use of estimates and assumptions   the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue expenses and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period the company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include but are not limited to history and prior experience experience of other enterprises in the same industry new related events and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion all adjustments necessary for a fair statement are reflected in the interim periods presented           investments   the company invests its excess cash primarily in debt instruments of highquality corporate and government issuers all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered longterm investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle such securities are classified as shortterm investments these securities are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value   changes in the value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the company recognizes realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s estimate of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access   level  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg interest rates yield curves default rates etc or can be corroborated by observable market data   level  valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use     revenue recognition   our online search advertising revenue is composed of perclick fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with intermediaries the perclick fee charged for keywordtargeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer the company has profitsharing agreements with several customers that call for the sharing of profits and losses profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreements revenue from these profitsharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit   revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of privatelabeled versions of our adcenter platform   revenues associated with online advertising products including advertiser networks are generally recognized once collectability is established delivery of services has occurred all performance obligations have been satisfied and no refund obligations exist we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners these payments are called traffic acquisition costs “tac” and are included in cost of revenue the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligors to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service   we also enter into agreements to provide privatelabeled versions of our products including licenses to the adcenter platform technology these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenuesharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application upfront fees minimum monthly fees and other license fees we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance other license fees over the term of the license and revenuesharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured           we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends the revenue allowance included in trade receivables net is insignificant at both september   and december     deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising   the company evaluates individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  revenue recognition  we test and record revenue accordingly   allowance for doubtful accounts   the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as bankruptcy the allowance for doubtful accounts included in trade accounts receivable net is  million at both september   and december   bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense was insignificant for the three months ended september   and  respectively   concentrations credit risk and credit risk evaluation   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents investments and accounts receivable as of september   and december   the company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial institution city national bank “cnb” and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument the company has not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices   credit risk customer and vendor evaluation   accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for estimated credit losses the company applies judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on management’s evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and records a specific allowance in addition the company records an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due historically such losses have been within management’s expectations   the following table reflects customers that accounted for more than  of

than            property and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost except when an impairment analysis requires the use of fair value and depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows   computer equipment        to  years furniture and fixtures        to  years software        to  years building improvements        years building        years   leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term   when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred expenditures that substantially increase an asset’s useful life are capitalized   in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired a  square foot data center facility in phoenix arizona this facility has allowed the company to consolidate its data needs in a companyowned data center and should allow for the expansion of its cloudbased offerings to its customers   internaluse software development costs   the company capitalizes external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internaluse computer software and the payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internaluse computer software these costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a threeyear period once the project is placed in service   management exercises judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs which is generally three years the company expects to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs in the future although no such costs were capitalized in the three months ended september     impairment of longlived assets   the company reviews longlived assets held or used in operations including property and equipment and internally developed software for impairment in accordance with asc  “ impairment and disposal of longlived assets ”   the company reviews assets for evidence of impairment annually at yearend and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable the impairment review requires the company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations and changes in competition           traffic acquisition costs   the company enters into agreements of varying durations with its distribution network partners that display the company’s listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the revenueperclick that the company receives when the ads are clicked on those partners’ sites   the company also enters into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates these affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage of the company’s revenue or based on a certain metric such as number of searches or paid clicks   tac expense is recorded in cost of revenue   sharebased compensation   the company recognizes sharebased compensation costs for all sharebased payment transactions with employees including grants of employee stock options restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model our assumptions about stockprice volatility are based on the actual volatility of our publicly traded stock the riskfree interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant we estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in the company’s consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods in the first quarter of  all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered therefore there was no sharebased compensation expense in the three or nine months ended september   sharebased compensation expense related to stock option grants and employee stock purchases recognized were zero for the three months ended september   and were not significant for the three months ended september     forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of sharebased awards that will ultimately vest the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter based on historical rates   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of sharebased compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paidin capital pool “apic pool” related to the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation awards   advertising costs   advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred and were insignificant and  in the three and nine months ended september   advertising costs were insignificant and  in the three and nine months ended september   respectively   product development costs   research of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized the company records liabilities where appropriate for all uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense   comprehensive loss   other comprehensive loss as of september   and december   consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as availableforsale and foreign currency translation adjustments           net loss per common share   basic net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding excluding treasury stock diluted net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding excluding treasury stock during the period using the treasury stock method for stock options as a result of the company’s net loss position at both september   and  there is no dilution   segment information   the company has one operating segment online advertising while the company operates under one operating segment management reviews revenue under two product offerings—advertiser networks and publisher solutions   as of september   and december   the company’s accounts receivable and deferred revenue are primarily related to the online advertising segment all longlived assets are located in the united states and canada   adoption of new accounting standards   on january   we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” asu  “ liabilities – obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date ” an amendment providing guidance for the recognition measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date adoption of this new guidance had no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations   on january   we adopted the guidance issued by the fasb asu  “ presentation of financial statements topic  and property plant and equipment topic    reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  asu  raised the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation adoption of this new guidance had no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations   recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  “asu ”  revenue from contracts with customers  asu  supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “revenue recognition topic ” and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is not permitted we are currently in the

compensation valuation assumptions   we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model our assumptions about stockprice volatility are

time of the grant we estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity   no options were granted in the first nine months of  or  therefore no weighted average assumptions are included here   sharebased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates   exercise of employee and director stock options and

includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level  of the hierarchy the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party nationally recognized pricing service “pricing service” when quoted market prices are unavailable the company utilizes a pricing service to determine a single estimate of fair value which is mainly for its fixed maturity investments the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level  of the hierarchy the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm’s length transaction   the company validates the prices received from the pricing service using various methods including applicability of federal deposit insurance corporation or other national government insurance or guarantees comparison of proceeds received on individual investments subsequent to reporting date prices received from publicly available sources and review of transaction volume data to confirm the presence of active markets the company does not adjust the prices received from the pricing service unless such prices are determined to be inconsistent at september   and december   the company did not adjust prices received from the pricing service   trade accounts receivable net the carrying value reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value and is net of allowances for doubtful accounts and returns which estimate customer nonperformance risk   trade accounts
