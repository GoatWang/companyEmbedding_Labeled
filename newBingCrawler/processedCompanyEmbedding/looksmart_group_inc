looksmart limited “predecessor” as a result of a reverse merger and spinoff transaction the “transaction” with pyxis tankers“pyxis”   the predecessor completed the transaction on october   for year to year comparisons when we refer to the year  we are referring to the predecessor   prior to the execution of the merger agreement the predecessor transferred all of its businesses assets and liabilities to the company in anticipation of the spinoff of company from the predecessor the company has assumed all liabilities of the predecessor and the liabilities of the predecessor’s former subsidiaries upon completion of the spinoff all of the predecessor’s shares of the common stock were cancelled and the company is  owned by the predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record

community platform during the three months ended september   the company determined that talkwheel had breached materially representations and warranties in the asset purchase agreement dated february   the “purchase agreement” governing the purchase of talkwheel’s assets as a result clickable terminated the purchase agreement and rescinded the transaction   principles of consolidation   the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of september   and december   and for the three months ended september   and  include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   unaudited interim financial information   the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of september   and for the three months ended september   and  reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair representation of the company’s financial position as of september   and the results of operations for the periods shown these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the consolidated balance sheet as of december   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” for complete financial statements the results of operations for the interim period ended september   is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year   use of estimates and assumptions   the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue expenses and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period the company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include but are not limited to history and prior experience experience of other enterprises in the same industry new related events and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion all adjustments necessary for a fair statement are reflected in the interim periods presented           investments   the company invests its excess cash primarily in debt instruments of highquality corporate and government issuers all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered longterm investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle such securities are classified as shortterm investments these securities are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value   changes in the value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive loss the company recognizes realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s estimate of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access   level  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg interest rates yield curves default rates etc or can be corroborated by observable market data   level  valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use     revenue recognition   our online search advertising revenue is composed of perclick fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with intermediaries the perclick fee charged for keywordtargeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer the company has profitsharing agreements with several customers that call for the sharing of profits and losses profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreements revenue from these profitsharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit   revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of privatelabeled versions of our adcenter platform   revenues associated with online advertising products including advertiser networks are generally recognized once collectability is established delivery of services has occurred all performance obligations have been satisfied and no refund obligations exist we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners these payments are called traffic acquisition costs “tac” and are included in cost of revenue the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligors to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service   we also enter into agreements to provide privatelabeled versions of our products including licenses to the adcenter platform technology these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenuesharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application upfront fees minimum monthly fees and other license fees we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance other license fees over the term of the license and revenuesharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured           we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends the revenue allowance included in trade receivables net is insignificant at both september   and december     deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising   the company evaluates individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  revenue recognition  we test and record revenue accordingly   allowance for doubtful accounts   the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as bankruptcy the allowance for doubtful accounts included in trade accounts receivable net is  million at both september   and december   bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense was insignificant for the three months ended september   and  respectively   concentrations credit risk and credit risk evaluation   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents investments and accounts receivable as of september   and december   the company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial institution city national bank “cnb” and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument the company has not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices   credit risk customer and vendor evaluation   accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for estimated credit losses the company applies judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on management’s evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and records a specific allowance in addition the company records an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due historically such losses have been within management’s expectations   the following table reflects customers that accounted for more than  of

than            property and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost except when an impairment analysis requires the use of fair value and depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows   computer equipment        to  years furniture and fixtures        to  years software        to  years building improvements        years building        years   leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term   when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred expenditures that substantially increase an asset’s useful life are capitalized   in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired a  square foot data center facility in phoenix arizona this facility has allowed the company to consolidate its data needs in a companyowned data center and should allow for the expansion of its cloudbased offerings to its customers   internaluse software development costs   the company capitalizes external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internaluse computer software and the payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internaluse computer software these costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a threeyear period once the project is placed in service   management exercises judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs which is generally three years the company expects to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs in the future although no such costs were capitalized in the three months ended september     impairment of longlived assets   the company reviews longlived assets held or used in operations including property and equipment and internally developed software for impairment in accordance with asc  “ impairment and disposal of longlived assets ”   the company reviews assets for evidence of impairment annually at yearend and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable the impairment review requires the company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations and changes in competition           traffic acquisition costs   the company enters into agreements of varying durations with its distribution network partners that display the company’s listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the revenueperclick that the company receives when the ads are clicked on those partners’ sites   the company also enters into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates these affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage of the company’s revenue or based on a certain metric such as number of searches or paid clicks   tac expense is recorded in cost of revenue   sharebased compensation   the company recognizes sharebased compensation costs for all sharebased payment transactions with employees including grants of employee stock options restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model our assumptions about stockprice volatility are based on the actual volatility of our publicly traded stock the riskfree interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant we estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in the company’s consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods in the first quarter of  all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered therefore there was no sharebased compensation expense in the three or nine months ended september   sharebased compensation expense related to stock option grants and employee stock purchases recognized were zero for the three months ended september   and were not significant for the three months ended september     forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of sharebased awards that will ultimately vest the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter based on historical rates   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of sharebased compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paidin capital pool “apic pool” related to the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation awards   advertising costs   advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred and were insignificant and  in the three and nine months ended september   advertising costs were insignificant and  in the three and nine months ended september   respectively   product development costs   research of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized the company records liabilities where appropriate for all uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense   comprehensive loss   other comprehensive loss as of september   and december   consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as availableforsale and foreign currency translation adjustments           net loss per common share   basic net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding excluding treasury stock diluted net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding excluding treasury stock during the period using the treasury stock method for stock options as a result of the company’s net loss position at both september   and  there is no dilution   segment information   the company has one operating segment online advertising while the company operates under one operating segment management reviews revenue under two product offerings—advertiser networks and publisher solutions   as of september   and december   the company’s accounts receivable and deferred revenue are primarily related to the online advertising segment all longlived assets are located in the united states and canada   adoption of new accounting standards   on january   we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” asu  “ liabilities – obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date ” an amendment providing guidance for the recognition measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date adoption of this new guidance had no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations   on january   we adopted the guidance issued by the fasb asu  “ presentation of financial statements topic  and property plant and equipment topic    reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  asu  raised the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation adoption of this new guidance had no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations   recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  “asu ”  revenue from contracts with customers  asu  supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “revenue recognition topic ” and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is not permitted we are currently in the

time of the grant we estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity   no options were granted in the first nine months of  or  therefore no weighted average assumptions are included here   sharebased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures

includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level  of the hierarchy the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party nationally recognized pricing service “pricing service” when quoted market prices are unavailable the company utilizes a pricing service to determine a single estimate of fair value which is mainly for its fixed maturity investments the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level  of the hierarchy the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm’s length transaction   the company validates the prices received from the pricing service using various methods including applicability of federal deposit insurance corporation or other national government insurance or guarantees comparison of proceeds received on individual investments subsequent to reporting date prices received from publicly available sources and review of transaction volume data to confirm the presence of active markets the company does not adjust the prices received from the pricing service unless such prices are determined to be inconsistent at september   and december   the company did not adjust prices received from the pricing service   trade accounts receivable net the carrying value reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value and is net of allowances for doubtful accounts and returns which estimate customer nonperformance risk   trade accounts
