decree has only minor differences between the three versions the rosetta stone proved to be the key to deciphering egyptian hieroglyphs the stone carved in black granodiorite during the hellenistic period is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple possibly at nearby sais it was probably moved during the early christian or medieval period and was eventually used as building material in the construction of fort julien near the town of rashid rosetta in the nile delta it was rediscovered there in july  by a french soldier named pierrefrançois bouchard during the napoleonic campaign in egypt it was the first ancient egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic language lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among european museums and scholars meanwhile british troops defeated the french in egypt in  and the original stone came into british possession under the capitulation of alexandria and was transported to london it has been on public display at the british museum almost continuously since  and is the mostvisited object there study of the decree was already under way when the first full translation of the greek text appeared in  it was  years however before the transliteration of the egyptian scripts was announced by jeanfrançois champollion in paris in  it took longer still before scholars were able to read ancient egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text  that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names  that the hieroglyphic text did so as well and had pervasive similarities to the demotic thomas young  and that in addition to being used for foreign names phonetic characters were also used to spell native egyptian words champollion – ever since its rediscovery the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries including its transfer from french to british possession during the napoleonic wars a longrunning dispute over the relative value of young and champollions contributions to the decipherment and since  demands for the stones return to egypt two other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later and several similar egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known including two slightly earlier ptolemaic decrees the decree of canopus in  bc and the memphis decree of ptolemy iv c  bc the rosetta stone is therefore no longer

links descriptionedit the rosetta stone is listed as a stone of black granodiorite bearing three inscriptions  found at rosetta in a contemporary catalogue of the artefacts discovered by the french expedition and surrendered to british troops in  at some period after its arrival in london the inscriptions on the stone were coloured in white chalk to make them more legible and the remaining surface was covered with a layer of carnauba wax designed to protect the rosetta stone from visitors fingers this gave a dark colour to the stone that led to its mistaken identification as black basalt these additions were removed when the stone was cleaned in  revealing the original dark grey tint of the rock the sparkle of its crystalline structure and a pink vein running across the top left corner comparisons with the klemm collection of egyptian rock samples showed a close resemblance to rock from a small granodiorite quarry at gebel tingar on the west bank of the nile west of elephantine in the region of aswan the pink vein is typical of granodiorite from this region the rosetta stone is  millimetres  ft  in high at its highest point  mm  ft  in wide and  mm  in thick it weighs approximately  kilograms  lb it bears three inscriptions the top register in ancient egyptian hieroglyphs the second in the egyptian demotic script and the third in ancient greek the front surface is polished and the inscriptions lightly incised on it the sides of the stone are smoothed but the back is only roughly worked presumably because this would have not been visible when it was erected original steleedit one possible reconstruction of the original stele the rosetta stone is a fragment of a larger stele no additional fragments were found in later searches of the rosetta site owing to its damaged state none of the three texts is absolutely complete the top register composed of egyptian hieroglyphs suffered the most damage only the last  lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen all of them are broken on the right side and  of them on the left the following register of demotic text has survived best it has  lines of which the first  are slightly damaged on the right side the final register of greek text contains  lines of which the first  survive in full the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone the full length of the hieroglyphic text and the total size of the original stele of which the rosetta stone is a fragment can be estimated based on comparable stelae that have survived including other copies of the same order the slightly earlier decree of canopus erected in  bc during the reign of ptolemy iii is  millimetres high  ft and  mm  in wide and contains  lines of hieroglyphic text  of demotic text and  of greek the texts are of similar length from such comparisons it can be estimated that an additional  or  lines of hieroglyphic inscription are missing from the top register of the rosetta stone amounting to another  millimetres  in in addition to the inscriptions there would probably have been a scene depicting the king being presented to the gods topped with a winged disc as on the canopus stele these parallels and a hieroglyphic sign for stela on the stone itself see gardiners sign list suggest that it originally had a rounded top the height of the original stele is estimated to have been about  centimetres  ft  in memphis decree and its contextedit main article rosetta stone decree the stele was erected after the coronation of king ptolemy v and was inscribed with a decree that established the divine cult of the new ruler the decree was issued by a congress of priests who gathered at memphis the date is given as  xandicus in the macedonian calendar and  meshir in the egyptian calendar which corresponds to march   bc the year is stated as the ninth year of ptolemy vs reign equated with  bc which is confirmed by four priests named who officiated in that same year aëtus son of aëtus was priest of the divine cults of alexander the great and the five ptolemies down to ptolemy v himself his three colleagues named in turn in the inscription led the worship of berenice euergetis wife of ptolemy iii arsinoe philadelphos wife and sister of ptolemy ii and arsinoe philopator mother of ptolemy v however a second date is also given in the greek and hieroglyphic texts corresponding to  november  bc the official anniversary of ptolemys coronation the inscription in demotic conflicts with this listing consecutive days in march for the decree and the anniversary it is uncertain why such discrepancies exist but it is clear that the decree was issued in  bc and that it was designed to reestablish the rule of the ptolemaic kings over egypt the decree was issued during a turbulent period in egyptian history ptolemy v epiphanes reigned from  to  bc the son of ptolemy iv philopator and his wife and sister arsinoe he had become ruler at the age of five after the sudden death of both of his parents who were murdered in a conspiracy that involved ptolemy ivs mistress agathoclea according to contemporary sources the conspirators effectively ruled egypt as ptolemy vs guardians until a revolt broke out two years later under general tlepolemus when agathoclea and her family were lynched by a mob in alexandria tlepolemus in turn was replaced as guardian in  bc by aristomenes of alyzia who was chief minister at the time of the memphis decree political forces beyond the borders of egypt exacerbated the internal problems of the ptolemaic kingdom antiochus iii the great and philip v of macedon had made a pact to divide egypts overseas possessions philip had seized several islands and cities in caria and thrace while the battle of panium  bc had resulted in the transfer of coelesyria including judaea from the ptolemies to the seleucids meanwhile in the south of egypt there was a longstanding revolt that had begun during the reign of ptolemy iv led by horwennefer and by his successor ankhwennefer both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young ptolemy v was officially crowned at memphis at the age of  seven years after the start of his reign and the memphis decree issued another fragmentary example of a donation stele in which the old kingdom pharaoh pepi ii grants tax immunity to the priests of the temple of min the stele is a late example of a class of donation stelae which depicts the reigning monarch granting a tax exemption to the resident priesthood pharaohs had erected these stelae over the previous  years the earliest examples dating from the egyptian old kingdom in earlier periods all such decrees were issued by the king himself but the memphis decree was issued by the priests as the maintainers of traditional egyptian culture the decree records that ptolemy v gave a gift of silver and grain to the temples it also records that there was particularly high flooding of the nile in the eighth year of his reign and he had the excess waters dammed for the benefit of the farmers in return for these concessions the priesthood pledged that the kings birthday and coronation days would be celebrated annually and that all the priests of egypt would serve him alongside the other gods the decree concludes with the instruction that a copy was to be placed in every temple inscribed in the language of the gods hieroglyphs the language of documents demotic and the language of the greeks as used by the ptolemaic government securing the favour of the priesthood was essential for the ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace the high priests of memphis—where the king was crowned—were particularly important as they were the highest religious authorities of the time and had influence throughout the kingdom given that the decree was issued at memphis the ancient capital of egypt rather than alexandria the centre of government of the ruling ptolemies it is evident that the young king was anxious to gain their active support thus although the government of egypt had been greekspeaking ever since the conquests of alexander the great the memphis decree like the two preceding decrees in the series included texts in egyptian to show its connection to the general populace by way of the literate egyptian priesthood there exists no one definitive english translation of the decree because of the minor differences between the three original texts and because modern understanding of the ancient languages continues to develop an uptodate translation by r s simpson appears on the british museum website based on the demotic text it can be compared with edwyn r bevans full translation in the house of ptolemy  based on the greek text with footnote comments on variations between this and the two egyptian texts the stele almost certainly did not originate in the town of rashid rosetta where it was found but more likely came from a temple site farther inland possibly the royal town of sais the temple from which it originally came was probably closed around ad  when eastern roman emperor theodosius i ordered the closing of all nonchristian temples of worship the original stele broke at some point its largest piece becoming what we now know as the rosetta stone ancient egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction and the rosetta stone probably was reused in this manner later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the mameluke sultan qaitbay c – to defend the bolbitine branch of the nile at rashid there it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery two other inscriptions of the memphis decrees have been found since the discovery of the rosetta stone the nubayrah stele and an inscription found at the temple of philae on the philae obelisk unlike the rosetta stone their hieroglyphic inscriptions were relatively intact the inscriptions on the rosetta stone had been deciphered long before the discovery of the other copies of the decree but subsequent egyptologists including wallis budge used these other inscriptions to further refine the actual hieroglyphs that must have been used in the lost portions of the hieroglyphic register on the rosetta stone rediscoveryedit report of the arrival of the rosetta stone in england in the gentlemans magazine  napoleons  campaign in egypt came at and helped cause the beginning of a burst of egyptomania in europe and especially france a corps of  technical experts savants known as the commission des sciences et des arts accompanied the french expeditionary army to egypt on july   french soldiers under the command of colonel dhautpoul were strengthening the defences of fort julien a couple of miles northeast of the egyptian port city of rosetta modernday rashid lieutenant pierrefrançois bouchard spotted a slab with inscriptions on one side that the soldiers had uncovered he and dhautpoul saw at once that it might be important and informed general jacquesfrançois menou who happened to be at rosettaa the find was announced to napoleons newly founded scientific association in cairo the institut dégypte in a report by commission member michel ange lancret noting that it contained three inscriptions the first in hieroglyphs and the third in greek and rightly suggesting that the three inscriptions were versions of the same text lancrets report dated july   was read to a meeting of the institute soon after july  bouchard meanwhile transported the stone to cairo for examination by scholars napoleon himself inspected what had already begun to be called la pierre de rosette the rosetta stone shortly before his return to france in august  the discovery was reported in september in courrier de légypte the official newspaper of the french expedition the anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day be the key to deciphering hieroglyphsa in  three of the commissions technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone one of these experts was jeanjoseph marcel a printer and gifted linguist who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the egyptian demotic script rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time rather than syriac as had originally been thought it was artist and inventor nicolasjacques conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription a slightly different method was adopted by antoine galland the prints that resulted were taken to paris by general charles dugua scholars in europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them after napoleons departure french troops held off british and ottoman attacks for another  months in march  the british landed at aboukir bay menou was now in command of the french expedition his troops including the commission marched north towards the mediterranean coast to meet the enemy transporting the stone along with many other antiquities he was defeated in battle and the remnant of his army retreated to alexandria where they were surrounded and besieged the stone now inside the city menou surrendered on august  from french to british possessionedit left and right sides of the rosetta stone with inscriptions in english relating to its capture by english forces from the french after the surrender a dispute arose over the fate of the french archaeological and scientific discoveries in egypt including the artefacts biological specimens notes plans and drawings collected by the members of the commission menou refused to hand them over claiming that they belonged to the institute british general john helyhutchinson refused to relieve the city until menou gave in scholars edward daniel clarke and william richard hamilton newly arrived from england agreed to examine the collections in alexandria and claimed to have found many artefacts that the french had not revealed in a letter home clarke said that we found much more in their possession than was represented or imagined hutchinson claimed that all materials were property of the british crown but french scholar étienne geoffroy sainthilaire told clarke and hamilton that the french would rather burn all their discoveries than turn them over referring ominously to the destruction of the library of alexandria clarke and hamilton pleaded the french scholars case to hutchinson who finally agreed that items such as natural history specimens would be the scholars private property menou quickly claimed the stone too as his private property hutchinson was equally aware of the stones unique value and rejected menous claim eventually an agreement was reached and the transfer of the objects was incorporated into the capitulation of alexandria signed by representatives of the british french and ottoman forces it is not clear exactly how the stone was transferred into british hands as contemporary accounts differ colonel tomkyns hilgrove turner was to escort it to england but he claimed later that he had personally seized it from menou and carried it away on a guncarriage in a much more detailed account edward daniel clarke stated that a french officer and member of the institute had taken him his student john cripps and hamilton secretly into the back streets behind menous residence and revealed the stone hidden under protective carpets among menous baggage according to clarke their informant feared that the stone might be stolen if french soldiers saw it hutchinson was informed at once and the stone was taken away—possibly by turner and his guncarriage turner brought the stone to england aboard the captured french frigate hms egyptienne landing in portsmouth in february  his orders were to present it and the other antiquities to king george iii the king represented by war secretary lord hobart directed that it should be placed in the british museum according to turners narrative he and hobart agreed that the stone should be presented to scholars at the society of antiquaries of london of which turner was a member before its final deposit in the museum it was first seen and discussed there at a meeting on march  bh experts inspecting the rosetta stone during the second international congress of orientalists  in  the society created four plaster casts of the inscriptions which were given to the universities of oxford cambridge and edinburgh and to trinity college dublin soon afterwards prints of the inscriptions were made and circulated to european scholarse before the end of  the stone was transferred to the british museum where it is located today new inscriptions painted in white on the left and right edges of the slab stated that it was captured in egypt by the british army in  and presented by king george iii patrons at the british museum view the rosetta stone as it was displayed in  a crowd of visitors examining the rosetta stone at the british museum the stone has been exhibited almost continuously in the british museum since june  during the middle of the th century it was given the inventory number ea  ea standing for egyptian antiquities it was part of a collection of ancient egyptian monuments captured from the french expedition including a sarcophagus of nectanebo ii ea  the statue of a high priest of amun ea  and a large granite fist ea  the objects were soon discovered to be too heavy for the floors of montagu house the original building of the british museum and they were transferred to a new extension that was built onto the mansion the rosetta stone was transferred to the sculpture gallery in  shortly after montagu house was demolished and replaced by the building that now houses the british museum according to the museums records the rosetta stone is its mostvisited single object and a simple image of it has been the museums best selling postcard for several decades replica of the rosetta stone as it was originally displayed within the kings library of the british museum the rosetta stone was originally displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal and rested within a metal cradle that was made for it which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides to ensure that the cradle fitted securely it originally had no protective covering and it was found necessary by  to place it in a protective frame despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors since  the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the egyptian sculpture gallery a replica of the rosetta stone is now available in the kings library of the british museum without a case and free to touch as it would have appeared to early thcentury visitors the museum was concerned about heavy bombing in london towards the end of the first world war in  and the rosetta stone was moved to safety along with other portable objects of value the stone spent the next two years  m  ft below ground level in a station of the postal tube railway at mount pleasant near holborn other than during wartime the rosetta stone has left the british museum only once for one month in october  to be displayed alongside champollions lettre at the louvre in paris on the th anniversary of the letters publication even when the rosetta stone was undergoing conservation measures in  the work was done in the gallery so that it could remain visible to the public reading the rosetta stoneedit for more information see decipherment of egyptian hieroglyphs prior to the discovery of the rosetta stone and its eventual decipherment the ancient egyptian language and script had not been understood since shortly before the fall of the roman empire the usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later pharaonic period by the th century ce few egyptians were capable of reading them monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all nonchristian temples in  by roman emperor theodosius i the last known inscription is dated to  august  found at philae and known as the graffito of esmetakhom hieroglyphs retained their pictorial appearance and classical authors emphasised this aspect in sharp contrast to the greek and roman alphabets in the th century the priest horapollo wrote hieroglyphica an explanation of almost  glyphs his work was believed to be authoritative yet it was misleading in many ways and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of egyptian writing later attempts at decipherment were made by arab historians in medieval egypt during the th and th centuries dhulnun almisri and ibn wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs by comparing them to the contemporary coptic language used by coptic priests in their time the study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by european scholars notably johannes goropius becanus in the th century athanasius kircher in the th and georg zoëga in the th the discovery of the rosetta stone in  provided critical missing information gradually revealed by a succession of scholars that eventually allowed jeanfrançois champollion to solve the puzzle that kircher had called the riddle of the sphinx greek textedit richard porsons suggested reconstruction of the missing greek text  the greek text on the rosetta stone provided the starting point ancient greek was widely known to scholars but they were not familiar with details of its use in the hellenistic period as a government language in ptolemaic egypt largescale discoveries of greek papyri were a long way in the future thus the earliest translations of the greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon stephen weston verbally presented an english translation of the greek text at a society of antiquaries meeting in april  meanwhile two of the lithographic copies made in egypt had reached the institut de france in paris in  there librarian and antiquarian gabriel de la porte du theil set to work on a translation of the greek but he was dispatched elsewhere on napoleons orders almost immediately and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague hubertpascal ameilhon ameilhon produced the first published translations of the greek text in  in both latin and french to ensure that they would circulate widelyf at cambridge richard porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the greek text he produced a skilful suggested reconstruction which was soon being circulated by the society of antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription at almost the same moment christian gottlob heyne in göttingen was making a new latin translation of the greek text that was more reliable than ameilhons which was first published in g it was reprinted by the society of antiquaries in a special issue of its journal archaeologia in  alongside westons previously unpublished english translation colonel turners narrative and other documentsh demotic textedit at the time of the stones discovery swedish diplomat and scholar johan david åkerblad was working on a littleknown script of which some examples had recently been found in egypt which came to be known as demotic he called it cursive coptic because he was convinced that it was used to record some form of the coptic language the direct descendant of ancient egyptian although it had few similarities with the later coptic script french orientalist antoineisaac silvestre de sacy had been discussing this work with åkerblad when he received one of the early lithographic prints of the rosetta stone in  from jeanantoine chaptal french minister of the interior he realised that the middle text was in this same script he and åkerblad set to work both focusing on the middle text and assuming that the script was alphabetical they attempted to identify the points where greek names ought to occur within this unknown text by comparing it with the greek in  silvestre de sacy reported to chaptal that he had successfully identified five names alexandros alexandreia ptolemaios arsinoe and ptolemys title epiphanesc while åkerblad published an alphabet of  letters more than half of which were correct that he had identified from the greek names in the demotic textd they could not however identify the remaining characters in the demotic text which as is now known included ideographic and other symbols alongside the phonetic ones johan david åkerblads table of demotic phonetic characters and their coptic equivalents  replica of the demotic texts hieroglyphic textedit champollions table of hieroglyphic phonetic characters with their demotic and coptic equivalents  silvestre de sacy eventually gave up work on the stone but he was to make another contribution in  prompted by discussions with a chinese student about chinese script silvestre de sacy considered a suggestion made by georg zoëga in  that the foreign names in egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically he also recalled that as early as  jeanjacques barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names thus when thomas young foreign secretary of the royal society of london wrote to him about the stone in  silvestre de sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text young might look for cartouches that ought to contain greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them young did so with two results that together paved the way for the final decipherment in the hieroglyphic text he discovered the phonetic characters p t o l m e s in todays transliteration p t w l m y s that were used to write the greek name ptolemaios he also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the demotic script and went on to note as many as  similarities between the hieroglyphic and demotic texts on the stone an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely different from one another this led him to deduce correctly that the demotic script was only partly phonetic also consisting of ideographic characters imitated from hieroglyphsi youngs new insights were prominent in the long article egypt that he contributed to the encyclopædia britannica in j he could make no further progress however in  young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with jeanfrançois champollion a teacher at grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient egypt champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and greek inscriptions of the philae obelisk in  on which william john bankes had tentatively noted the names ptolemaios and kleopatra in both languages from this champollion identified the phonetic characters k l e o p a t r a in todays transliteration q l i҆ w p ꜣ d r ꜣt on the basis of this and the foreign names on the rosetta stone he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters which appears in his famous  lettre à m dacier sent to bonjoseph dacier secretary of the paris académie des inscriptions et belleslettres and immediately published by the académiek in the postscript champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both greek and egyptian names a hypothesis confirmed in  when he identified the names of pharaohs ramesses and thutmose written in cartouches at abu simbel these far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by bankes and sent to champollion by jeannicolas huyotm from this point the stories of the rosetta stone and the decipherment of egyptian hieroglyphs diverge as champollion drew on many other texts to develop an ancient egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in  later workedit the rosetta stone in the british museum work on the stone now focused on fuller understanding of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another in  classical scholar antoinejean letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the greek text for champollions use champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ following champollions sudden death in  his draft of this analysis could not be found and letronnes work stalled françois salvolini champollions former student and assistant died in  and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers this discovery incidentally demonstrated that salvolinis own publication on the stone published in  was plagiarismo letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the greek text and his new french translation of it which appeared in p during the early s german egyptologists heinrich brugsch and max uhlemann produced revised latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic textsqr the first english translation followed in  the work of three members of the philomathean society at the university of pennsylvanias whether one of the three texts was the standard version from which the other two were originally translated is a question that has remained controversial letronne attempted to show in  that the greek version the product of the egyptian government under the macedonian ptolemies was the originalp among recent authors john ray has stated that the hieroglyphs were the most important of the scripts on the stone they were there for the gods to read and the more learned of their priesthood philippe derchain and heinz josef thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously while stephen quirke sees in the decree an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions richard parkinson points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life the fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why its decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to egyptian hieroglyphs rivalriesedit a giant copy of the rosetta stone by joseph kosuth in figeac france the birthplace of jeanfrançois champollion even before the salvolini affair disputes over precedence and plagiarism punctuated the decipherment story thomas youngs work is acknowledged in champollions  lettre à m dacier but incompletely according to british critics for example james browne a subeditor on the encyclopædia britannica which had published youngs  article anonymously contributed a series of review articles to the edinburgh review in  praising youngs work highly and alleging that the unscrupulous champollion plagiarised it these articles were translated into french by julius klaproth and published in book form in n youngs own  publication reasserted the contribution that he had madel the early deaths of young  and champollion  did not put an end to these disputes the authoritative work on the stone by british museum curator e a wallis budge  gives special emphasis to youngs contribution compared with champollions in the early s french visitors complained that the portrait of champollion was smaller than one of young on an adjacent information panel english visitors complained that the opposite was true the portraits were in fact the same size requests for repatriation to egyptedit egypt first requested the return of the rosetta stone in july  on the british museums th anniversary zahi hawass the chief of egypts supreme council of antiquities asked that the stele be repatriated to egypt commenting that it was the icon of our egyptian identity he repeated the proposal two years later in paris listing the stone as one of several key items belonging to egypts cultural heritage a list which also included the iconic bust of nefertiti in the egyptian museum of berlin a statue of the great pyramid architect hemiunu in the roemerundpelizaeusmuseum in hildesheim germany the dendara temple zodiac in the louvre in paris and the bust of ankhhaf from the museum of fine arts boston during  the british museum presented egypt with a fullsized replica of the stele this was initially displayed in the renovated rashid national museum close to the site where the stone was found in november  hawass suggested a threemonth loan of the rosetta stone while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return in december  he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the rosetta stone if the british museum lent the stone to egypt for three months for the opening of the grand egyptian museum at giza in  these requests were refused a replica of the rosetta stone in rashid rosetta egypt as john ray has observed the day may come when the stone has spent longer in the british museum than it ever did in rosetta there is strong opposition among national museums to the repatriation of objects of international cultural significance such as the rosetta stone in response to repeated greek requests for return of the elgin marbles from the parthenon and similar requests to other museums around the world in  over  of the worlds leading museums — including the british museum the louvre the pergamon museum in berlin and the metropolitan museum in new york city — issued a joint statement declaring that objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed in the light of different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era and that museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation idiomatic useedit the term rosetta stone has been used idiomatically to represent a crucial key in the process of decryption of encoded information especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole according to the oxford english dictionary the first figurative use of the term appeared in the  edition of the encyclopædia britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose another use of the phrase is found in h g wells  novel the shape of things to come where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter since then the term has been widely used in other contexts for example nobel laureate theodor w hänsch in a  scientific american article on spectroscopy wrote that the spectrum of the hydrogen atoms has proved to be the rosetta stone of modern physics once this pattern of lines had been deciphered much else could also be understood fully understanding the key set of genes to the

with one mans dream to find a better way to learn a language that dream has since evolved into one of the most recognized technologybased learning companies in the world after struggling to learn russian through traditional methods founder allen stoltzfus set out to develop an effective way to learn a new language through natural immersion in the late s he envisioned using computer technology to simulate the way that people learn their native language—with pictures and sounds in context and with no translation—and innovate language education for learners of all ages stoltzfus enlisted the help of his brotherinlaw john fairfield to explore the possibilities of making his dream a reality and in  cdrom technology made the project possible together they founded fairfield language technologies in harrisonburg va with stoltzfus at the helm as the companys first chairman and president he recruited his brother eugene stoltzfus to lend his design expertise to the structural and visual components of the program the resulting product was then named rosetta stone after the artifact that had unlocked the secrets of egyptian hieroglyphics for linguists the name certainly fits as rosetta stone products now unlock learning success for millions of users worldwide in  rosetta stone went global establishing offices in various major markets around the world and in  the company was
