mail and pay for a “return receipt” so you’ll be able to document what the collector received once the collector receives your letter they may not contact you again with two exceptions a collector can contact you to tell you there will be no further contact or to let you know that they or the creditor intend to take a specific action like filing a lawsuit sending such a letter to a debt collector

higher compared to the lowest comparable yield among the eurozone states ie yields above  in september  indicates that financial institutions have serious doubts about creditworthiness of the state the european debt crisis often also referred to as the eurozone crisis or the european sovereign debt crisis is a multiyear debt crisis that has been taking place in the european union since the end of  several eurozone member states greece portugal ireland spain and cyprus were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out overindebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other eurozone countries the european central bank ecb or the international monetary fund imf the detailed causes of the debt crisis varied in several countries private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies postbubble the structure of the eurozone as a currency union ie one currency without fiscal union eg different tax and public pension rules contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of european leaders to respond european banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing as concerns intensified in early  and thereafter leading european nations implemented a series of financial support measures such as the european financial stability facility efsf and european stability mechanism esm the ecb also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering interest rates and providing cheap loans of more than one trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between european banks on  september  the ecb calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailoutprecautionary programme from efsfesm through some yield lowering outright monetary transactions omt return to economic growth and improved structural deficits enabled ireland and portugal to exit their bailout programmes in july  greece and cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in  spain never officially received a bailout programme its rescue package from the esm was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the government itself the crisis had significant adverse economic effects and labour market effects with unemployment rates in greece and spain reaching  and was blamed for subdued economic growth not only for the entire eurozone but for the entire european union as such it can be argued to have had a major political impact on the ruling governments in  out of  eurozone countries contributing to

lending and borrowing practices the financial crisis of – international trade imbalances real estate bubbles that have since burst the great recession of – fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses in  members of the european union signed the maastricht treaty under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels however in the early s some eu member states were failing to stay within the confines of the maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts andor deficits sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards this allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques including inconsistent accounting offbalancesheet transactions and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures from late  on after greeces newly elected pasok government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit fears of sovereign defaults in certain european states developed in the public and the government debt of several states was downgraded the crisis subsequently spread to ireland and portugal while raising concerns about italy spain and the european banking system and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone the underreporting was exposed through a revision of the forecast for the  budget deficit from – of gdp no greater than  of gdp was a rule of the maastricht treaty to  almost immediately after the pasok party won the october  greek national elections large upwards revision of budget deficit forecasts due to the international financial crisis were not limited to greece for example in the united states forecast for the  budget deficit was raised from  billion projected in the  fiscal year budget to  trillion while in the united kingdom there was a final forecast more than  times higher than the original in greece the low – forecast was reported until very late in the year september  clearly not corresponding to the actual situation the fact that the greek debt exceeded  billion over  of gdp and france owned  of that debt struck terror into investors at the word default although market reaction was rather slow—greek year government bond yield only exceeded  in april —they coincided with a large number of negative articles leading to arguments about the role of international news media and other actors

in europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy as of january  a group of  central and eastern european banks had already asked for a bailout at the time the european commission released a forecast of a  decline in eu economic output for  making the outlook for the banks even worse the many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debttogdp ratios experienced by several european governments in the wake of the great recession the main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in europe were reportedly a mix of weak actual and potential growth competitive weakness liquidation of banks and sovereigns large preexisting debttogdp ratios and considerable liability stocks government private and nonprivate sector in the first few weeks of  there was renewed anxiety about excessive national debt with lenders demanding everhigher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels deficits and current account deficits this in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt particularly when economic growth rates were low and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors as in the case of greece and portugal the states that were adversely affected by the crisis faced a strong rise in interest rate spreads for government bonds as a result of investor concerns about their future debt sustainability four eurozone states had to be rescued by sovereign bailout programs which were provided jointly by the international monetary fund and the european commission with additional support at the technical level from the european central bank together these three international organisations representing the bailout creditors became nicknamed the troika to fight the crisis some governments have focused on raising taxes and lowering expenditures which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on cds between these countries and other eu member states most importantly germany by the end of  germany was estimated to have made more than € billion out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate german federal government bonds bunds by july  also the netherlands austria and finland benefited from zero or negative interest rates looking at shortterm government bonds with a maturity of less than one year the list of beneficiaries also includes belgium and france while switzerland and denmark equally benefited from lower interest rates the crisis also harmed its export sector due to a substantial influx of foreign capital and the resulting rise of the swiss franc in september  the swiss national bank surprised currency traders by pledging that it will no longer tolerate a eurofranc exchange rate below the minimum rate of  francs effectively weakening the swiss franc this is the biggest swiss intervention since  despite sovereign debt having risen substantially in only a few eurozone countries with the three most affected countries greece ireland and portugal collectively only accounting for  of the eurozones gross domestic product gdp it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole leading to speculation of further contagion of other european countries and a possible breakup of the eurozone in total the debt crisis forced five out of  eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of  in mid due to successful fiscal consolidation and implementation of structural reforms in the countries being most at risk and various policy measures taken by eu leaders and the ecb see below financial stability in the eurozone has improved significantly and interest rates have steadily fallen this has also greatly diminished contagion risk for other eurozone countries as of october update only  out of  eurozone countries namely greece portugal and cyprus

sensitive to changes in the business cycle the government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the countrys debt increased accordingly despite the drastic upwards revision of the forecast for the  budget deficit in october  greek borrowing rates initially rose rather slowly by april  it was apparent that the country was becoming unable to borrow from the markets on  april  the greek government requested an initial loan of € billion from the eu and international monetary fund imf to cover its financial needs for the remaining part of  a few days later standard  poors slashed

programme this was met with great anger by some greeks leading to massive protests riots and social unrest throughout greece the troika a tripartite committee formed by the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund ec ecb and imf offered greece a second bailout loan worth € billion in october  second economic adjustment programme but with the activation being conditional on implementation of further austerity measures and a debt restructure agreement a bit surprisingly the greek prime minister george papandreou first answered that call by announcing a december  referendum on the new bailout plan but had to back down amidst strong pressure from eu partners who threatened to withhold an overdue € billion loan payment that greece needed by middecember on  november  papandreou resigned following an agreement with the new democracy party and the popular orthodox rally to appoint nonmp technocrat lucas papademos as new prime minister of an interim national union government with responsibility for implementing the needed austerity measures to pave the way for the second bailout loan all the implemented austerity measures have helped greece bring down its primary deficit—ie fiscal deficit before interest payments—from €bn  of gdp in  to just €bn  of gdp in  but as a sideeffect they also contributed to a worsening of the greek recession which began in october  and only became worse in  and  the greek gdp had its worst decline in  with − a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended  lower than in  and with

best option for greece and the rest of the eu would be to engineer an orderly default allowing athens to withdraw simultaneously from the eurozone and reintroduce its national currency the drachma at a debased rate if greece were to leave the euro the economic and political consequences would be devastating according to japanese financial company nomura an exit would lead to a  devaluation of the

to provide a second bailout package worth € billion conditional on the implementation of another harsh austerity package that would reduce greek expenditure by €bn in  and another €bn in  and  then in march  the greek government did finally default on its debt which was the largest default in history by a government about twice as big as russias  default this counted as a credit event and holders of credit default swaps were paid accordingly this included a new law passed by the government so that private holders of greek government bonds banks insurers and investment funds would voluntarily accept a bond swap with a  nominal writeoff partly in shortterm efsf notes partly in new greek bonds with lower interest rates and the maturity prolonged to – years independently of the previous maturity it is the worlds biggest debt restructuring deal ever done affecting some € billion of greek government bonds the debt writeoff had a size of € billion and caused the greek debt level to fall

greek government debt towards private creditors mainly private banks outside greece replacing it with new debt to public creditors on more favourable terms that is to say paying out their private

public debt of greece to foreign governments including debt to the euimf loan facility and debt through the eurosystem increased from €bn to €bn bn between january  and september  while the combined exposure of foreign banks to public and private greek entities was reduced from well over €bn in  to around €bn −bn by midfebruary  as of update  of greek debt is owed to public sector institutions

debt and bn of banks debt of these countries according to a leaked document dated may  the imf was fully aware of the fact that the greek bailout program was aimed at rescuing the private european banks – mainly from france and germany a number of imf executive board members from india brazil argentina russia and switzerland criticized this in an internal memorandum pointing out that greek debt would be unsustainable however their french german and dutch colleagues refused to reduce the greek debt or to make their private banks pay mid may  the crisis and impossibility to form a new government after elections and the possible victory by the antiausterity axis led to new speculations greece would have to leave the eurozone shortly due this phenomenon became known as grexit and started to govern international market behaviour the centrerights narrow victory in the  june election gave hope that greece would honour its obligations and stay in the eurozone due to a delayed reform schedule and a worsened economic recession the new government immediately asked the troika to be granted an extended deadline from  to  before being required to restore the budget into a

passed a new austerity package worth €bn including a labour market reform and midterm fiscal plan – in return the eurogroup agreed on the following day to lower interest rates and prolong debt maturities and to provide greece with additional funds of around €bn for a debtbuyback programme the latter allowed greece to retire about half of the € billion in debt that athens owes private

service markets is proving tough because interest groups are slowing reforms the biggest challenge for greece is to overhaul the tax administration with a significant part of annually assessed taxes

election called by the greek parliament in december  and the following formation of a syrizaled government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement the rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to greece under its current programme until such time as the greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors this rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis both for the greek government and greek financial system resulting in plummeting stock prices at the athens stock exchange while interest rates for the greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source faced by the threat of a sovereign default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone some final attempts were made by the greek government in may  to settle an agreement with the troika about some adjusted terms for greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme the eurogroup recently granted a sixmonth technical extension of its current bailout programme to greece now set to expire by the end of june  which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short expectations are that greece in addition will need a

comprising €bn for bank recapitalisation and €bn for refinancing maturing debt plus €bn to cover budget deficits in  which in total would have increased the cypriot debttogdp ratio to around  the final agreed package however only entailed a €bn support package financed partly by imf €bn and esm €bn because it was possible to reach a fund saving agreement with the cypriot authorities featuring a direct closure of the most troubled laiki bank and a forced bailin recapitalisation plan for bank of cyprus the final conditions for activation of the bailout package was outlined by the troikas mou agreement in april  and include  recapitalisation of the entire financial sector while accepting a closure of the laiki bank  implementation of the antimoney laundering framework in cypriot financial institutions  fiscal consolidation to help bring down the cypriot governmental budget deficit  structural reforms to restore competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances  privatization programme the cypriot debttogdp ratio is on this background now forecasted only to peak at  in  and subsequently decline to  in  and thus considered to remain within sustainable territory the €bn bailout comprise €bn spend on debt liabilities refinancing and amortization bn to cover fiscal deficits and €bn for the bank recapitalization these amounts will be paid to cyprus through regular tranches from  may  until  march  according to the programme this will be sufficient as cyprus during the programme period in addition will receive €bn extraordinary revenue from privatization of government assets ensure an automatic rollover of €bn maturing treasury bills and €bn of maturing bonds held by domestic creditors bring down the funding need for bank recapitalization with €bn  of which bn is reinjection of future profit earned by the cyprus central bank injected in advance at the short term by selling its gold reserve and €bn origin from the bailin of creditors in laiki bank and bank of cyprus the forced automatic rollover of maturing bonds held by domestic creditors were conducted in  and equaled according to some credit rating agencies a selective default or restrictive default mainly because of the fact that the fixed yields of the new bonds did not reflect the market rates  while maturities at the same time automatically were extended  many sources list the first bailout was €bn followed by the second on €bn when you deduct €bn due to irelandportugalslovakia opting out as creditors for the first bailout and add the extra €bn imf has promised to pay greece for the years in  through a programme extension implemented in december  the total amount of bailout funds sums up to €bn the first bailout resulted in a payout of €bn from imf and €bn from glf during the course of may  until december  and then it was technically replaced by a second bailout package for  which had a size of €bn €bn from imf and €bn from efsf as it included the remaining committed amounts from the first bailout package all committed imf amounts were made available to the greek government for financing its continued operation of public budget deficits and to refinance maturing public debt held by private creditors and imf the payments from efsf were earmarked to finance €bn of psi restructured government debt as part of a deal where private investors in return accepted a nominal haircut lower interest rates and longer maturities for their remaining principal €bn for bank recapitalization €bn for a second psi debt buyback while the remaining €bn were made available to cover continued operation of public budget deficits the combined programme was scheduled to expire in march  after imf had extended their programme period with extra loan tranches from january  to march  as a mean to help greece service the total sum of interests accruing during the lifespan of already issued imf loans while the eurogroup at the same time opted to conduct their reimbursement and deferral of interests outside their bailout programme framework  with the efsf programme still being planned to end in december  due to the refusal by the greek government to comply with the agreed conditional terms for receiving a continued flow of bailout transfers both imf and the eurogroup opted to freeze their programmes since august  to avoid a technical expiry the eurogroup postponed the expiry date for its frozen programme to  june  paving the way within this new deadline for the possibility of transfer terms first to be renegotiated and then finally complied with to ensure completion of the programme as greece withdrew unilaterally from the process of settling renegotiated terms and time extension for the completion of the programme it expired uncompleted on  june  hereby greece lost the possibility to extract €bn of remaining funds from the efsf €bn unused psi and bond interest facilities €bn unused bank recapitalization funds and a €bn frozen tranche of macroeconomic support and also lost the remaining sdr bn of imf funds being equal to €bn as per the sdr exchange rate on  jan  although those lost imf funds might be recouped if greece settles an agreement for a new third bailout programme with esm  and passes the first review of such programme  a new third bailout programme worth €bn in total jointly covered by funds from imf and esm will be disbursed in tranches from august  until august  the programme was approved to be negotiated on  july  and approved in full detail by the publication of an esm facility agreement on  august  imfs transfer of the remainder of its frozen iii programme and their new commitment also to contribute with a part of the funds for the third bailout depends on a successful prior completion of the first review of the new third programme in october  due to a matter of urgency efsm immediately conducted a temporary €bn emergency transfer to greece on  july  which was fully overtaken by esm when the first tranche of the third program was conducted  august  due to being temporary bridge financing and not part of an official bailout programme the table do not display this special type of efsm transfer the loans of the program has an average maturity of  years and carry a variable interest rate currently at  the program has earmarked transfer of up till €bn for bank recapitalization purposes to be used to the extent deemed needed by the annual stress tests of the ssm and also include establishment of a new privatization fund to conduct sale of greek public assets  of which the first generated €bn will be used for early repayment of the bailout loans earmarked for bank recapitalizations potential debt relief for greece in the form of longer grace and payment periods will be considered by the european public creditors after the first review of the new programme by octobernovember   hungary recovered faster than expected and thus did not receive the remaining €bn bailout support scheduled for october october  imf paid in total  out of  billion sdr equal to €bn out of €bn at current exchange rates  in ireland the national treasury management agency also paid €bn for the program on behalf of the irish government of which €bn were injected by the national pensions reserve fund and the remaining €bn paid by domestic cash resources which helped increase the program total to €bn as this extra amount by technical terms is an internal bailin it has not been added to the bailout total as of  march  all committed funds had been transferred with efsf even paying €bn more so that the total amount of funds had been marginally increased from €bn to €bn  latvia recovered faster than expected and thus did not receive the remaining €bn bailout support originally scheduled for   portugal completed its support programme as scheduled in june  one month later than initially planned due to awaiting a verdict by its constitutional court but without asking for establishment of any subsequent precautionary credit line facility by the end of the programme all committed amounts had been transferred except for the last tranche of €bn bn from efsm and bn from imf which the portuguese government declined to receive the reason why the imf transfers still mounted to slightly more than the initially committed €bn was due to its payment with sdrs instead of euro  and some favorable developments in the eursdr exchange rate compared to the beginning of the programme in november  portugal received its last delayed €bn tranche from efsm post programme hereby bringing its total drawn bailout amount up at €bn out of €bn  romania recovered faster than expected and thus did not receive the remaining €bn bailout support originally scheduled for   romania had a precautionary credit line with €bn available to draw money from if needed during the period march june  but entirely avoided to draw on it during the period the world bank however supported with a transfer of €bn as a dpl development loan programme and €bn as results based financing for social assistance and health  romania had a second €bn precautionary credit line established jointly by imf and eu of which imf accounts for sdr bn  €bn which is available to draw money from if needed during the period from october  to  september  in addition the world bank also made €bn available under a development policy loan with a deferred drawdown option valid from january  through december  the world bank will throughout the period also continue providing earlier committed development programme support of €bn but this extra transfer is not accounted for as bailout support in the third programme due to being earlier committed amounts in april  the world bank increased their support by adding the transfer of a first €bn fiscal effectiveness and growth development policy loan with the final second fegdpl tranch on €bn worth about bn to be contracted in the first part of  no money had been drawn from the precautionary credit line as of may   spains €bn support package has been earmarked only for recapitalisation of the financial sector initially an efsf emergency account with €bn was available but nothing was drawn and it was cancelled again in november  after being superseded by the regular esm recapitalisation programme the first esm recapitalisation tranch of €bn was approved  november and transferred to the bank recapitalisation fund of the spanish government frob on  december  a second tranch for category  banks on €n was approved by the commission on  december and finally transferred by esm on  february  category  banks were also subject for a possible third tranch in june  in case they failed before then to acquire sufficient additional capital funding from private markets during january  all category  banks however managed to fully recapitalise through private markets and thus will not be in need for any state aid the remaining €bn of the initial support package is thus not expected to be activated but will stay available as a fund with precautionary capital reserves to possibly draw upon if unexpected things happen  until  december  in total

countrys banking crisis and specialist in balance sheet recessions as saying i do not think europeans understand the implications of a systemic banking crisis  when all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time the result is going to be even weaker banks and an even longer recession—if not depression  government intervention should be the first resort not the last resort beyond equity issuance and debttoequity conversion then one analyst said that as banks find it more difficult to raise funds they will move faster to cut down on loans and unload lagging assets as they work to improve capital ratios this latter contraction of balance sheets could lead to a depression the analyst said reduced lending was a circumstance already at the time being seen in a deepening crisis

economy by lowering interest rates for businesses the ecb cut its bank rates in multiple steps in – reaching an historic low of  in november  the lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to

interest rate to  and set the deposit rate at − the latter move in particular was seen as a bold and unusual move as a negative interest rate had never been tried on a widescale before additionally the ecb announced it would offer longterm fouryear loans at the cheap rate normally the rate is primarily for overnight lending but only if the borrowing banks met strict conditions designed to ensure the funds ended up in the hands of businesses instead of for example being used to buy low risk government bonds collectively the moves are aimed at avoiding deflation devaluing the euro to make exportation more viable and at increasing real world lending stock markets reacted strongly to the ecb rate cuts the german dax index for example set a record high the day the new rates were announced meanwhile the euro briefly fell to a fourmonth low against the dollar however due to the unprecedented nature of the negative interest rate the longterm effects of the stimulus measures are hard to

measures implemented by most european nations to counter this debt crisis us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman argues that an abrupt return to nonkeynesian financial policies is not a viable solution pointing at historical evidence he predicts that deflationary policies now being imposed on countries such as greece and spain will prolong and deepen their recessions together with over  signatories of a manifesto for economic sense krugman also dismissed the belief of austerity focusing policy makers such as eu economic commissioner olli rehn and most european finance ministers that budget consolidation revives confidence in financial markets over the longer haul in a  study that analysed  imf austerity programmes the imfs independent evaluation office found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth in early  an imf official who negotiated greek austerity measures admitted that spending cuts were harming greece in october  the imf said that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programmes have been consistently overoptimistic suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected and countries which implemented fiscal stimulus such as germany and austria did better than expected also portugal did comparably better than spain the latter introduced drastic austerity measures but was unable not meet its eu budget deficit targets on the other hand portugals leftist coalition fought austerity it increased the minimum wage by  percent and took back cuts in the pension system and the public sector and at the same time reduced its budget deficit to below three percent in  according to historian florian schui from university of st gallen no austerity program has ever worked schui particularly notes winston churchills attempt in  and heinrich brünings attempt in  during the weimar republic both led to disastrous consequences despite years of draconian austerity measures greece has failed to reach a balanced budget as public revenues remain low according to keynesian economists growthfriendly austerity relies on the false argument that public cuts would be compensated for by more spending from consumers and businesses a theoretical claim that has not materialised the case of greece shows that excessive levels of private indebtedness and a collapse of public confidence over  of greeks fear unemployment poverty and the closure of businesses led the private sector to decrease spending in an attempt to save up for rainy days ahead this led to even lower demand for both products and labour which further deepened the recession and made it ever more difficult to generate tax revenues and fight public indebtedness according to financial times chief economics commentator martin wolf structural tightening does deliver actual tightening but its impact is much less than one to one a one percentage point reduction in the structural deficit delivers a  percentage point improvement in the actual fiscal deficit this means that ireland eg would require structural fiscal tightening of more than  to eliminate its  actual fiscal deficit a task that is difficult to achieve without an exogenous eurozonewide economic boom according to the europlus monitor report  no country should tighten its fiscal reins by more than  of gdp in one year to avoid recession instead of public austerity a growth compact centring on tax increases and deficit spending is proposed since struggling european countries lack the funds to engage in deficit spending german economist and member of the german council of economic experts peter bofinger and sony kapoor of the global think tank redefine suggest providing € billion in additional funds to the european investment bank eib which could then lend ten times that amount to the employmentintensive smaller business sector the eu is currently planning a possible € billion increase in the eibs capital base furthermore the two suggest financing additional public investments by growthfriendly taxes on property land wealth carbon emissions and the undertaxed financial

hidden in secret tax havens by the end of  resulting in a tax deficit of up to bn apart from arguments over whether or not austerity rather than increased or frozen spending is a macroeconomic solution union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists investors and bankers over  million eu workers have become unemployed as a consequence of the global economic crisis of – and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only europe but the entire world in the turmoil of the global financial crisis the focus across all eu member states has been gradually to implement austerity measures with the purpose of lowering the budget deficits to levels below  of gdp so that the debt level would either stay below or start decline towards the  limit defined by the stability and growth pact to further restore the confidence in europe  out of  eu countries also agreed to adopt the euro plus pact consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness  out of  eu countries also decided to implement the fiscal compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national lawconstitution the fiscal compact is a direct successor of the previous stability and growth pact but it is more strict not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national lawconstitution but also because it starting from  will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum  or  depending on the debt level each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme greece portugal and ireland was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidationausterity and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation ie lowering their relative production costs the measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed not only to build the foundation for gdp growth but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states germany has come under pressure due to not having a government budget deficit and funding it by borrowing more as of late  the government federal and state has spent less than it receives in revenue for the third year in a row despite low economic growth the  budget includes a surplus for the first time since  current projections are that by  the debt will be less than required by the stability and growth pact it has been a long known belief that austerity measures will always reduce the gdp growth in the short term some economists believing in keynesian policies criticised the timing and amount of austerity measures being called for in the bailout programmes as they argued such extensive measures should not be implemented during the crisis years with an ongoing recession but if possible delayed until the years after some positive real gdp growth had returned in october  a report published by international monetary fund imf also found that tax hikes and spending cuts during the most recent decade had indeed damaged the gdp growth more severely compared to what had been expected and forecasted in advance based on the gdp damage ratios previously recorded in earlier decades and under different economic scenarios already a halfyear earlier several european countries as a response to the problem with subdued gdp growth in the eurozone likewise had called for the implementation of a new reinforced growth strategy based on additional public investments to be financed by growthfriendly taxes on property land wealth and financial institutions in june  eu leaders agreed as a first step to moderately increase the funds of

never compete with lowcost developing countries such as china or india instead weak european countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services though this is a longterm process and may not bring immediate relief fiscal devaluation another option would be to implement fiscal devaluation based on an idea originally developed by john maynard keynes in  according to this neokeynesian logic policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employers social security contributions while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption vat and pollution ie by pursuing an ecological tax reform germany has successfully pushed its economic competitiveness by increasing the value added tax vat by three percentage points in  and using part of the additional revenues to lower employers unemployment insurance contribution portugal has taken a similar stance and also france appears to follow this suit in november  french president françois hollande announced plans to reduce tax burden of the corporate sector by € billion within three years while increasing the standard vat from  to  and introducing additional ecotaxes in  to minimise negative effects of such policies on purchasing power and economic activity the french government will partly offset the tax hikes by decreasing employees social security contributions by € billion and by reducing the lower vat for convenience goods necessities from  to  progress eurozone economic health and adjustment progress – source euro plus monitor on  november  the lisbon council published the euro plus monitor  according to the report most critical eurozone member countries are in the process of rapid reforms the authors note that many of those countries most in need to adjust  are now making the greatest progress towards restoring their fiscal balance and external competitiveness greece ireland and spain are among the top five reformers and portugal is ranked seventh among  countries included in the report see graph in its euro plus monitor report  published in november  the lisbon council finds that the eurozone has slightly improved its overall health with the exception of greece all eurozone crisis countries are either close to the point where they have achieved the major adjustment or are likely to get there over the course of  portugal and italy are expected to progress to the turnaround stage in spring  possibly followed by spain in autumn while the fate of greece continues to hang in the balance overall the authors suggest that if the eurozone gets through the current acute crisis and stays on the reform path it could eventually emerge from the crisis as the most dynamic of the major western economies the euro plus monitor update from spring  notes that the eurozone remains on the right track according to the authors almost all vulnerable countries in need of adjustment are slashing their underlying fiscal deficits and improving their external competitiveness at an impressive speed for which they expected the eurozone crisis to be over by the end of  address current account imbalancesedit current account imbalances – play media animated graph of current account imbalances since  regardless of the corrective measures chosen to solve the current predicament as long as cross border capital flows remain unregulated in the euro area current account imbalances are likely to continue a country that runs a large current account or trade deficit ie importing more than it exports must ultimately be a net importer of capital this is a mathematical identity called the balance of payments in other words a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports conversely germanys large trade surplus net export position means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital lending money to other countries to allow them to buy german goods the  trade deficits for italy spain greece and portugal were estimated to be bn bn and bn and bn respectively while germanys trade surplus was bn a similar imbalance exists in the us which runs a large trade deficit net import position and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad ben bernanke warned of the risks of such imbalances in  arguing that a savings glut in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits artificially lowering interest rates and creating asset bubbles a country with a large trade surplus would generally see the value of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases this currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting countrys currency used to purchase the goods alternatively trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders or by raising interest rates although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments either way many of the countries involved in the crisis are on the euro so devaluation individual interest rates and capital controls are not available the only solution left to raise a countrys level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits for example if a countrys citizens saved more instead of consuming imports this would reduce its trade deficit it has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits eg greece consume less and improve their exporting industries on the other hand export driven countries with a large trade surplus such as germany austria and the netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption economic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits which require private borrowing to fund than public debt levels economist paul krugman wrote in march   the really strong relationship within the eurozone countries is between interest spreads and current account deficits which is in line with the conclusion many of us have reached that the euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis not a debt crisis a february  paper from four economists concluded that countries with debt above  of gdp and persistent currentaccount trade deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration  progress in its spring  economic forecast the european commission finds some evidence that the currentaccount rebalancing is underpinned by changes in relative prices and competitiveness positions as well as gains in export market shares and expenditure switching in deficit countries in may  german finance minister wolfgang schäuble has signalled support for a significant increase in german wages to help decrease current account imbalances within the eurozone according to the euro plus monitor report  the collective current account of greece ireland italy portugal and spain is improving rapidly and is expected to balance by mid  thereafter these countries as a group would no longer need to import capital in  the current account surplus of the eurozone as a whole almost doubled compared to the previous year reaching a new record high of bn euros mobilisation of creditedit several proposals were made in mid to purchase the debt of distressed european countries such as spain and italy markus brunnermeier the economist graham bishop and daniel gros were among those advancing proposals finding a formula which was not simply backed by germany is central in crafting an acceptable and effective remedy commentaryedit us president barack obama stated in june  right now europes focus has to be on strengthening their overall banking systemmaking a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that the banking system is solid  in addition theyre going to have to look at how do they achieve growth at the same time as theyre carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish so countries like spain and italy for example have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary—everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues but theyve got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed and if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up and people are pulling back further from spending money because theyre feeling a lot of pressure—ironically that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term  in addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances theres a parallel discussion thats taking place among european leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root the economist wrote in june  outside germany a consensus has developed on what mrs merkel must do to preserve the single currency it includes shifting from austerity to a far greater focus on economic growth complementing the single currency with a banking union with eurowide deposit insurance bank oversight and joint means for the recapitalisation or resolution of failing banks and embracing a limited form of debt mutualisation to create a joint safe asset and allow peripheral economies the room gradually to reduce their debt burdens this is the refrain from washington beijing london and indeed

sovereigndebt crisis european fiscal unionedit the crisis is pressuring the euro to move beyond a regulatory state and towards a more federal eu with fiscal powers increased european integration giving a central body increased control over the budgets of member states was proposed on  june  by jens weidmann president of the deutsche bundesbank expanding on ideas first proposed by jeanclaude trichet former president of the european central bank control including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed this proposal is similar to contemporary calls by angela merkel for increased political and fiscal union which would allow europe oversight possibilities european bank recovery and resolution authorityedit main article single resolution mechanism european banks are estimated to have incurred losses approaching € trillion between the outbreak of the financial crisis in  and  the european commission approved some € trillion in state aid for banks between october  and october  a sum which includes the value of taxpayerfunded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts this has prompted some economists such as joseph stiglitz and paul krugman to note that europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis on  june  the european commission adopted a legislative proposal for a harmonised bank recovery and resolution mechanism the proposed framework sets out the necessary steps and powers to ensure that bank failures across the eu are managed in a way that avoids financial instability the new legislation would give member states the power to impose losses resulting from a bank failure on the bondholders to minimise costs for taxpayers the proposal is part of a new scheme in which banks will be compelled to bailin their creditors whenever they fail the basic aim being to prevent taxpayerfunded bailouts in the future the public authorities would also be given powers to replace the management teams in banks even before the lender fails each institution would also be obliged to set aside at least one per cent of the deposits covered by their national guarantees for a special fund to finance the resolution of banking crisis starting in  eurobondsedit main article eurobonds a growing number of investors and economists say eurobonds would be the best way of solving a debt crisis though their introduction matched by tight financial and budgetary coordination may well require changes in eu treaties on  november  the european commission suggested that eurobonds issued jointly by the  euro nations would be an effective way to tackle the financial crisis using the term stability bonds jose manuel barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances germany remains largely opposed at least in the short term to a collective takeover of the debt of states that have run excessive budget deficits and borrowed excessively over the past years european safe bondsedit a group of economists from princeton university suggest a new form of european safe bonds esbies ie bundled european government bonds  senior bonds  junior bonds in the form of a unionwide safe asset without joint liability according to the authors esbies would be at least as safe as german bunds and approximately double the supply of euro safe assets when protected by a thick junior tranche esbies could be issued by public or privatesector entities and would weaken the diabolic loop and its diffusion across countries it requires no significant change in treaties or legislation“ in  the idea was picked up by the european central bank the european commission has also shown interest and plans to include esbies in a future white paper dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis european monetary fundedit on  october  the austrian institute of economic research published an article that suggests transforming the efsf into a european monetary fund emf which could provide governments with fixed interest rate eurobonds at a rate slightly below mediumterm economic growth in nominal terms these bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the emf and liquidated at any time given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ecb the emu would achieve a similarly strong position visàvis financial investors as the us where the fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent to ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure the emf would operate according to strict rules providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria governments lacking sound financial policies would be forced to rely on traditional national governmental bonds with less favourable market rates the econometric analysis suggests that if the shortterm and long term interest rates in the euro area were stabilised at  and  respectively aggregate output gdp in the euro area would be  percentage points above baseline in  at the same time sovereign debt levels would be significantly lower with eg greeces debt level falling below  of gdp more than  percentage points below the baseline scenario with marketbased interest levels furthermore banks would no longer be able to benefit unduly from intermediary profits by borrowing from the ecb at low rates and investing in government bonds at high rates debt writeoff financed by wealth taxedit overall debt levels in  and writeoffs necessary in the eurozone uk and us to reach sustainable grounds according to the bank for international settlements the combined private and public debt of  oecd countries nearly quadrupled between  and  and will likely continue to grow reaching between  for italy and about  for japan by  a bis study released in june  warns that budgets of most advanced economies excluding interest payments would need  consecutive years of surpluses exceeding  per cent of gross domestic product—starting now—just to bring the debttogdp ratio back to its precrisis level the same authors found in a previous study that increased financial burden imposed by ageing populations and lower growth makes it unlikely that indebted economies can grow out of their debt problem if only one of the following three conditions is met government debt is more than  to  of gdp nonfinancial corporate debt is more than  percent private household debt is more than  of gdp the first condition suggested by an influential paper written by kenneth rogoff  carmen reinhart has been disputed due to major calculation errors in fact the average gdp growth at public debtgdp ratios over  is not dramatically different from when debtgdp ratios are lower the boston consulting group bcg adds that if the overall debt load continues to grow faster than the economy then largescale debt restructuring becomes inevitable to prevent a vicious upward debt spiral from gaining momentum the authors urge policy makers to act quickly and decisively and aim for an overall debt level well below  for the private and government sector this number is based on the assumption that governments nonfinancial corporations and private households can each sustain a debt load of  of gdp at an interest rate of  per cent and a nominal economic growth rate of  per cent per year lower interest rates andor higher growth would help reduce the debt burden further to reach sustainable levels the eurozone must reduce its overall debt level by € trillion according to bcg this could be financed by a onetime wealth tax of between  and  for most countries apart from the crisis countries particularly ireland where a writeoff would have to be substantially higher the authors admit that such programmes would be drastic unpopular and require broad political coordination and leadership but they maintain that the longer politicians and central bankers wait the more necessary such a step will be thomas piketty french economist and author of the bestselling book capital in the twentyfirst century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity inefficient and unjust and inflation only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital according to his analysis a flat tax of  percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a years worth national income which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt instead of a onetime writeoff german economist harald spehl has called for a year debtreduction plan similar to the one germany used after world war ii to share the burden of reconstruction and development similar calls have been made by political parties in germany including the greens and the left debt writeoff based on international agreementedit in  hanswerner sinn president of german ifo institute for economic research called for a debt relief for greece in addition economists from london school of economics suggested a debt relief similar to the london agreement in  private sector lenders as well as governments agreed to write off about half of west germany’s outstanding debt this was followed by the beginning of germanys economic miracle or wirtschaftswunder according to this agreement west germany had to make repayments only when it was running a trade surplus that is when it had earned the money to pay up rather than having to borrow more or dip into its foreign currency reserves its repayments were also limited to  of export earnings as lse researchers note this had the effect that germany’s creditors had an incentive to buy the country’s goods so that it would be able to afford to pay them controversiesedit main article controversies surrounding the eurozone crisis the european bailouts are largely about shifting exposure from banks and others who otherwise are lined up for losses on the sovereign debt they have piled up onto european taxpayers eu treaty violationsedit wikisource has original text related to this article consolidated version of the treaty on the functioning of the european union no bailout clause the eus maastricht treaty contains juridical language that appears to rule out intraeu bailouts first the no bailout clause article  tfeu ensures that the responsibility for repaying public debt remains national and prevents risk premiums caused by unsound fiscal policies from spilling over to partner countries the clause thus encourages prudent fiscal policies at the national level the european central banks purchase of distressed country bonds can be viewed as violating the prohibition of monetary financing of budget deficits article  tfeu the creation of further leverage in efsf with access to ecb lending would also appear to violate the terms of this article articles  and  were meant to create disincentives for eu member states to run excessive deficits and state debt and prevent the moral hazard of overspending and lending in good times they were also meant to protect the taxpayers of the other more prudent member states by issuing bailout aid guaranteed by prudent eurozone taxpayers to rulebreaking eurozone countries such as greece the eu and eurozone countries also encourage moral hazard in the future while the no bailout clause remains in place the no bailout doctrine seems to be a thing of the past convergence criteria the eu treaties contain so called convergence criteria specified in the protocols of the treaties of the european union as regards government finance the states agreed that the annual government budget deficit should not exceed  of gross domestic product gdp and that the gross government debt to gdp should not exceed  of gdp see protocol  and  for eurozone members there is the stability and growth pact which contains the same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime in the past many european countries have substantially exceeded these criteria over a long period of time around  most eurozone members violated the pact resulting in no action taken against violators actors fuelling the crisisedit credit rating agenciesedit standard  poors headquarters in lower manhattan new york city the international usbased credit rating agencies—moodys standard  poors and fitch—which have already been under fire during the housing bubble and the icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current european bond market crisis on one hand the agencies have been accused of giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest on the other hand ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble in the case of greece the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades with greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such according to a study by economists at st gallen university credit rating agencies have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in  the authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments on average rating portugal ireland and greece  notches lower than under precrisis standards eventually forcing them to seek international aid on a side note as of end of november  only three countries in the eurozone retain aaa ratings from standard  poor ie germany finland and luxembourg european policy makers have criticised ratings agencies for acting politically accusing the big three of bias towards european assets and fuelling speculation particularly moodys decision to downgrade portugals foreign debt to the category ba junk has infuriated officials from the eu and portugal alike state owned utility and infrastructure companies like ana – aeroportos de portugal energias de portugal redes energéticas nacionais and brisa – autoestradas de portugal were also downgraded despite claims to having solid financial profiles and significant foreign revenue france too has shown its anger at its downgrade french central bank chief christian noyer criticised the decision of standard  poors to lower the rating of france but not that of the united kingdom which has more deficits as much debt more inflation less growth than us similar comments were made by highranking politicians in germany michael fuchs deputy leader of the leading christian democrats said standard and poors must stop playing politics why doesnt it act on the highly indebted united states or highly indebted britain adding that the latters collective private and public sector debts are the largest in europe he further added if the agency downgrades france it should also downgrade britain in order to be consistent credit rating agencies were also accused of bullying politicians by systematically downgrading eurozone countries just before important european council meetings as one eu source put it it is interesting to look at the downgradings and the timings of the downgradings it is strange that we have so many downgrades in the weeks of summits regulatory reliance on credit ratings thinktanks such as the world pensions council wpcfr have criticised european powers such as france and germany for pushing for the adoption of the basel ii recommendations adopted in  and transposed in european union law through the capital requirements directive crd effective since  in essence this forced european banks and more importantly the european central bank eg when gauging the solvency of eubased financial institutions to rely heavily on the standardised assessments of credit risk marketed by only two private us firms moodys and sp counter measures due to the failures of the ratings agencies european regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies with the creation of the european supervisory authority in january  the eu set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions including the european securities and markets authority esma which became the eus single creditratings firm regulator creditratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on eu territory says esma chief steven maijoor germanys foreign minister guido westerwelle called for an independent european ratings agency which could avoid the conflicts of interest that he claimed usbased agencies faced european leaders are reportedly studying the possibility of setting up a european ratings agency in order that the private usbased ratings agencies have less influence on developments in european financial markets in the future according to german consultant company roland berger setting up a new ratings agency would cost € million on  january  the company said it was already collecting funds from financial institutions and business intelligence agencies to set up an independent nonprofit ratings agency by mid which could provide its first country ratings by the end of the year in april  in a similar attempt the bertelsmann stiftung presented a blueprint for establishing an international nonprofit credit rating agency incra for sovereign debt structured in way that management and rating decisions are independent from its financiers but attempts to regulate credit rating agencies more strictly in the wake of the eurozone crisis have been rather unsuccessful world pensions council wpcfr financial law and regulation experts have argued that the hastily drafted unevenly transposed in national law and poorly enforced eu rule on ratings agencies regulation ec n°  has had little effect on the way financial analysts and economists interpret data or on the potential for conflicts of interests created by the complex contractual arrangements between credit rating agencies and their clients mediaedit some in the greek spanish and french press and elsewhere spread conspiracy theories that claimed that the us and britain were deliberately promoting rumors about the euro in order to cause its collapse or to distract attention from their own economic vulnerabilities the economist rebutted these anglosaxon conspiracy claims writing that although american and british traders overestimated the weakness of southern european public finances and the probability of the breakup of the eurozone breakup these sentiments were an ordinary market panic rather than some deliberate plot greek prime minister papandreou is quoted as saying that there was no question of greece leaving the euro and suggested that the crisis was politically as well as financially motivated this is an attack on the eurozone by certain other interests political or financial the spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero has also suggested that the recent financial market crisis in europe is an attempt to undermine the euro he ordered the centro nacional de inteligencia intelligence service national intelligence centre cni in spanish to investigate the role of the anglosaxon media in fomenting the crisis so far no results have been reported from this investigation other commentators believe that the euro is under attack so that countries such as the uk and the us can continue to fund their large external deficits and government deficits and to avoid the collapse of the us the us and uk do not have large domestic savings pools to draw on and therefore are dependent on external savings eg from china this is not the case in the eurozone which is selffunding speculatorsedit both the spanish and greek prime ministers have accused financial speculators and hedge funds of worsening the crisis by short selling euros german chancellor merkel has stated that institutions bailed out with public funds are exploiting the budget crisis in greece and elsewhere goldman sachs and other banks faced an inquiry by the federal reserve over their derivatives arrangements with greece the guardian reported that goldman was reportedly the most heavily involved of a dozen or so wall street banks that assisted the greek government in the early s to structure complex derivatives deals early in the decade and borrow billions of dollars in exchange rate swaps which did not officially count as debt under eurozone rules critics of the banks conduct said that these deals contributed to unsustainable public finances which in turn destabilized the eurozone in response to accusations that speculators were worsening the problem some markets banned naked short selling for a few months speculation about the breakup of the eurozoneedit further information greek withdrawal from the eurozone some economists mostly from outside europe and associated with modern monetary theory and other postkeynesian schools condemned the design of the euro currency system from the beginning because it ceded national monetary and economic sovereignty but lacked a central fiscal authority when faced with economic problems they maintained without such an institution emu would prevent effective action by individual countries and put nothing in its place us economist martin feldstein went so far to call the euro an experiment that failed some nonkeynesian economists such as luca a ricci of the imf contend that the eurozone does not fulfil the necessary criteria for an optimum currency area though it is moving in that direction as the debt crisis expanded beyond greece these economists continued to advocate albeit more forcefully the disbandment of the eurozone if this was not immediately feasible they recommended that greece and the other debtor nations unilaterally leave the eurozone default on their debts regain their fiscal sovereignty and readopt national currencies bloomberg suggested in june  that if the greek and irish bailouts should fail an alternative would be for germany to leave the eurozone to save the currency through depreciation instead of austerity the likely substantial fall in the euro against a newly reconstituted deutsche mark would give a huge boost to its members competitiveness iceland not part of the eu is regarded as one of europes recovery success stories it defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency which has effectively reduced wages by  making exports more competitive lee harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment swedens floating rate currency gives it a shortterm advantage structural reforms and constraints account for longerterm prosperity labour concessions a minimal reliance on public debt and tax reform helped to further a progrowth policy the wall street journal conjectured as well that germany could return to the deutsche mark or create another currency union with the netherlands austria finland luxembourg and other european countries such as denmark norway sweden switzerland and the baltics a monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the worlds largest creditor bloc bigger than china or japan the wall street journal added that without the germanled bloc a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus in support of a jobtargeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration breakup vs deeper integration there is opposition in this view the national exits are expected to be an expensive proposition the breakdown of the currency would lead to insolvency of several euro zone countries a breakdown in intrazone payments having instability and the public debt issue still not solved the contagion effects and instability would spread into the system having that the exit of greece would trigger the breakdown of the eurozone this is not welcomed by many politicians economists and journalists according to steven erlanger from the new york times a greek departure is likely to be seen as the beginning of the end for the whole euro zone project a major accomplishment whatever its faults in the postwar construction of a europe whole and at peace likewise the two big leaders of the euro zone german chancellor angela merkel and former french president nicolas sarkozy have said on numerous occasions that they would not allow the eurozone to disintegrate and have linked the survival of the euro with that of the entire european union in september  eu commissioner joaquín almunia shared this view saying that expelling weaker countries from the euro was not an option those who think that this hypothesis is possible just do not understand our process of integration the former ecb president jeanclaude trichet also denounced the possibility of a return of the deutsche mark the challenges to the speculation about the breakup or salvage of the eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that the breakup or salvage of eurozone is not only an economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that if berlin pays the bills and tells the rest of europe how to behave it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against germany and  it would strengthen the camp in britain arguing for an exit—a problem not just for britons but for all economically liberal europeans solutions which involve greater integration of european banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by european umbrella institutions can be criticised as germanic domination of european political and economic life according to us author ross douthat this would effectively turn the european union into a kind of postmodern version of the old austrohungarian empire with a germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations the economist provides a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that a limited version of federalisation could be less miserable solution than breakup of the euro the recipe to this tricky combination of the limited federalisation greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the fiscal integration in order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy the overindebted countries require access to money and for banks to have a safe eurowide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country which could be obtained by narrower eurobond that mutualises a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time the proposition made by german council of economic experts provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all eurozone economies above  of their gdp instead of the breakup and issuing new national governments bonds by individual eurozone governments everybody from germany debt  of gdp to italy  would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the  threshold the new mutualisedbond market worth some € trillion would be paid off over the next  years each country would pledge a specified tax such as a vat surcharge to provide the cash so far german chancellor angela merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation the hungarianamerican business magnate george soros warns in does the euro have a future that there is no escape from the gloomy scenario of a prolonged european recession and the consequent threat to the eurozones political cohesion so long as the authorities persist in their current course he argues that to save the euro longterm structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis the changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the european union soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the european financial stability fund into a fullfledged european treasury following the formation of the treasury the european council could then authorise the ecb to step into the breach with risks to the ecbs solvency being indemnified soros acknowledges that converting the efsf into a european treasury will necessitate a radical change of heart in particular he cautions germans will be wary of any such move not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the euro and abandoning it soros writes that a collapse of the european union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus the only way to avert another great depression is the formation of a european treasury the british betting company ladbrokes stopped taking bets on greece exiting the eurozone in may  after odds fell to  and reported plenty of support for  odds for a complete disbanding of the eurozone during  odious debtedit main article odious debt some protesters commentators such as libération correspondent jean quatremer and the liègebased ngo committee for the abolition of the third world debt cadtm allege that the debt should be characterised as odious debt the greek documentary debtocracy and a book of the same title and content examine whether the recent siemens scandal and uncommercial ecb loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of a large amount of the debt manipulated debt and deficit statisticsedit in  members of the european union signed an agreement known as the maastricht treaty under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels some eu member states including greece and italy were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels through the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures the structures were designed by prominent us investment banks who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties financial reforms within the us since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets the revision of greeces  budget deficit from a forecast of – of gdp to  by the new pasok government in late  a number which after reclassification of expenses under imfeu supervision was further raised to  in  has been cited as one of the issues that ignited the greek debt crisis this added a new dimension in the world financial turmoil as the issues of creative accounting and manipulation of statistics by several nations came into focus potentially undermining investor confidence the focus has naturally remained on greece due to its debt crisis there have been reports about manipulated statistics by eu and other nations aiming as was the case for greece to mask the sizes of public debts and deficits these have included analyses of examples in several countries the united kingdom spain the united states and even germany collateral for finlandedit on  august  as requested by the finnish parliament as a condition for any further bailouts it became apparent that finland would receive collateral from greece enabling it to participate in the potential new € billion support package for the greek economy austria the netherlands slovenia and slovakia responded with irritation over this special guarantee for finland and demanded equal treatment across the eurozone or a similar deal with greece so as not to increase the risk level over their participation in the bailout the main point of contention was that the collateral is aimed to be a cash deposit a collateral the greeks can only give by recycling part of the funds loaned by finland for the bailout which means finland and the other eurozone countries guarantee the finnish loans in the event of a greek default after extensive negotiations to implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries on  october  a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached the expectation is that only finland will utilise it due in part to a requirement to contribute initial capital to european stability mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time finland as one of the strongest aaa countries can raise the required capital with relative ease at the beginning of october slovakia and netherlands were the last countries to vote on the efsf expansion which was the immediate issue behind the collateral discussion with a midoctober vote on  october  slovakia approved euro bailout expansion but the government has been forced to call new elections in exchange in

debtceiling crisis of   financial crisis of – government shutdowns of –  terminology cumulative deficit  interest ≈ debt balance of payments inflation v t e the national debt of the united states is the amount owed by the federal government of the united states the measure of the public debt is the value of the outstanding treasury securities at a point of time that have been issued by the treasury and other federal government agencies the terms national deficit and national surplus usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year not the cumulative total a deficit year increases the debt because more money is spent than is received a surplus year decreases the debt because more money is received than spent there are two components of gross national debt debt held by the public such as treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government including those held by individuals corporations the federal reserve system and foreign state and local governments debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt such as nonmarketable treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries such as the social security trust fund debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses including interest earnings of these accounts that have been invested in treasury securities in general government debt increases as a result of government spending and decreases from tax or other receipts both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year in practice treasury securities are not issued or redeemed on a daybyday basis and may also be issued or redeemed as part of the federal governments macroeconomic monetary management operations the aggregate gross amount that treasury can borrow is limited by the united states debt ceiling historically the us public debt as a share of gross domestic product gdp has increased during wars and

had a fluctuating public debt since its formation in  except for about a year during – to allow comparisons over the years public debt is often expressed as a ratio to gross domestic product gdp historically the united states public debt as a share of gdp has increased during wars and recessions and subsequently declined the united states public debt as a percentage of gdp reached its highest level during harry trumans first presidential term during and after world war ii public debt as a percentage of gdp fell rapidly in the postworld war ii period and reached a low in  under richard nixon debt as a share of gdp has consistently increased since then except under jimmy carter and bill clinton public debt rose during the s as ronald reagan cut tax rates and increased military spending it fell during the s due to decreased military spending increased taxes and the s boom public debt rose sharply in the wake of the – financial crisis and the resulting significant tax revenue declines and spending increases valuation and measurementedit public and government accountsedit detailed breakdown of government holders of treasury debt and debt instruments used of the public portion on january   debt held by the public was  trillion or about  of the previous  months of gdp intragovernmental holdings stood at  trillion giving a combined total gross national debt of  trillion or about  of the previous  months of gdp the national debt can also be classified into marketable or nonmarketable securities most of the marketable securities are treasury notes bills and bonds held by investors and governments globally the nonmarketable securities are mainly the government account series owed to certain government trust funds such as the social security trust fund which represented  trillion in  the nonmarketable securities represent amounts owed to program beneficiaries for example in the case of the social security trust fund the payroll taxes dedicated to social security were credited to the trust fund upon receipt but spent for other purposes if the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the social security trust fund in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other other large intragovernmental holders include the federal housing administration the federal savings and loan corporations resolution fund and the federal hospital insurance trust fund medicarecitation needed accounting treatmentedit us debt from  to  red lines indicate the debt held by the public and black lines indicate the total national debt or gross public debt the difference is the intragovernmental debt which includes obligations to government programs such as social security stated as a formula national debt  debt held by the public  intragovernmental debt the second panel shows the two debt figures as a percentage of us gdp dollar value of us economic production for that year the top panel is deflated so every year is in  dollars only debt held by the public is reported as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of the united states government debt held by government accounts is an asset to those accounts but a liability to the treasury they offset each other in the consolidated financial statements government receipts and expenditures are normally presented on a cash rather than an accrual basis although the accrual basis may provide more information on the longerterm implications of the governments annual operations the united states public debt is often expressed as a ratio of public debt to gross domestic product gdp the ratio of debt to gdp may decrease as a result of a government surplus as well as due to growth of gdp and inflationcitation needed fannie mae and freddie mac obligations excludededit see also federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac under normal accounting rules fully owned companies would be consolidated into the books of the owner but the large size of fannie and freddie has made the us government reluctant to incorporate freddie and fannie into its own books when freddie and fannie required bailouts white house budget director jim nussle on september   initially indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the gse debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention as the intervention has dragged out pundits have started to further question this accounting treatment noting that changes in august  makes them even more permanent wards of the state and turns the governments preferred stock into a permanent perpetual kind of security the government controls the public company accounting oversight board which would normally criticize inconsistent accounting practices but it does not oversee its own governments accounting practices or the standards set by the federal accounting standards advisory board the on or offbalance sheet obligations of those two independent gses was just over  trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees and agency bonds the confusing independent but governmentcontrolled status of the gses has resulted in investors of the legacy common shares and preferred shares launching various activist campaigns in  guaranteed obligations excludededit see also temporary liquidity guarantee program and exchange stabilization fund us federal government guarantees are not included in the public debt total until such time as there is a call on the guarantees for example the us federal government in late guaranteed large amounts of obligations of mutual funds banks and corporations under several programs designed to deal with the problems arising from the lates financial crisis the guarantee program lapsed at the end of  when congress declined to extend the scheme the funding of direct investments made in response to the crisis such as those made under the troubled assets relief program are included in the debt unfunded obligations excludededit the us government is obligated under current law to make mandatory payments for programs such as medicare medicaid and social security the government accountability office gao projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next  years the medicare part a hospital insurance payouts already exceed program tax revenues and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal  these deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing the present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated  trillion this is the amount that would have had to be set aside in  in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which under current law will have to be raised by the government in the future approximately  trillion relates to social security while  trillion relates to medicare and medicaid in other words health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than social security adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly  trillion however these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt as shown in monthly treasury reports of the national debt measuring debt burdenedit gdp is a measure of the total size and output of the economy one measure of the debt burden is its size relative to gdp called the debttogdp ratio mathematically this is the debt divided by the gdp amount the congressional budget office includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual budget and economic outlook debt held by the public as a percentage of gdp rose from  gdp in  to  in  and  in  mathematically the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in gdp which also takes account of inflation is higher than the rate of increase of debt conversely the debt to gdp ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced if the decline in gdp is sufficient according to the cia world factbook during  the us debt to gdp ratio of  was the th highest in the world this was measured using debt held by the public however  trillion in additional borrowing since the end of fy  has raised the ratio to  as of april  see appendixnational debt for selected years also this number excludes state and local debt according to the oecd general government gross debt federal state and local in the united states in the fourth quarter of  was  trillion  of gdp subtracting out  trillion for intergovernmental federal debt to count only federal debt held by the public gives  of gdp the ratio is higher if the total national debt is used by adding the intragovernmental debt to the debt held by the public for example on april   debt held by the public was approximately  trillion or about  of gdp intragovernmental holdings stood at  trillion giving a combined total public debt of  trillion us gdp for the previous  months was approximately  trillion for a total debt to gdp ratio of approximately  calculating the annual change in debtedit comparison of deficits to change in debt in  conceptually an annual deficit or surplus should represent the change in the national debt with a deficit adding to the national debt and a surplus reducing it however there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media the total deficit considerably different from the annual increase in the debt the major categories of differences are the treatment of the social security program treasury borrowing and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process social security payroll taxes and benefit payments along with the net balance of the us postal service are considered offbudget while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered onbudget the total federal deficit is the sum of the onbudget deficit or surplus and the offbudget deficit or surplus since fy the federal government has run onbudget deficits except for fy and fy and total federal deficits except in fy and fy–fy for example in january  the cbo reported that for fiscal year  fy the onbudget deficit was  billion offset by an offbudget surplus mainly due to social security revenue in excess of payouts of  billion for a total deficit of  billion this latter figure was the one commonly reported in the media however an additional  billion was required for the treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets an unusually high amount due to the subprime mortgage crisis this meant that the debt held by the public increased by  billion b  b  b the offbudget surplus was borrowed and spent as is typically the case increasing the intragovernmental debt by  billion so the total increase in the national debt in fy was b b   billion the treasury department reported an increase in the national debt of b for fy the  billion difference is likely due to supplemental appropriations for the war on terror some of which were outside the budget process entirely until president obama began including most of them in his fy budget in other words spending the off budget social security surplus adds to the total national debt by increasing the intragovernmental debt while the offbudget surplus reduces the total deficit reported in the media certain spending called supplemental appropriations is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt funding for the iraq and afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the obama administration certain stimulus measures and earmarks were also outside the budget process the federal government publishes the total debt owed public and intragovernmental holdings monthly reductionedit negative real interest ratesedit since  the us treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt meaning the inflation rate is greater than the interest rate paid on the debt such low rates outpaced by the inflation rate occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies pensions or bond money market and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in treasury securities to hedge against risk economist lawrence summers has stated that at such low interest rates government borrowing actually saves taxpayer money and improves creditworthiness in the late s through the early s the us and uk both reduced their debt burden by about  to  of gdp per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low between  and  the us debttogdp ratio fell from  to  even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which were much smaller than the deficits converting fractional reserve to full reserve bankingedit the two economists jaromir benes and michael kumhof working for the international monetary fund published a working paper called the chicago plan revisited suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by raising bank reserve requirements converting from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking economists at the paris school of economics have commented on the plan stating that it is already the status quo for coinage currency and a norges bank economist has examined the proposal in the context of considering the finance industry as part of the real economy a centre for economic policy research paper agrees with the conclusion that no real liability is created by new fiat money creation and therefore public debt does not rise as a result debt ceilingedit main article united states debt ceiling the debt ceiling is a legislative mechanism to limit the amount of national debt that can be issued by the treasury in effect it will restrain the treasury from paying for expenditures after the limit has been reached even if the expenditures have already been approved in the budget and have been appropriated if this situation were to occur it is unclear whether treasury would be able to prioritize payments on debt to avoid a default on its debt obligations but it would have to default on some of its nondebt obligations debt holdingsedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august

mandatory programs is projected to rise relative to gdp while discretionary programs decline interest to gdp a measure of debt burden was very low in  but is projected to rise with both interest rates and debt levels over the – period cbo shortterm outlookedit the congressional budget office cbo reported in its february  budget and economic outlook which covers the – period that deficits were projected to return to approximately the historical average relative to the size of the economy gdp by  the cbo estimated that under current law the deficit would total  billion in fiscal year  or  gdp deficits would then slowly begin rising again through  due primarily to the pressures of an aging population and rising healthcare costs per person the debt to gdp ratio would remain stable for much of the decade then begin rising again toward the end of the year forecast window from  in  to  in  cbo longterm outlookedit the cbo reports its longterm budget outlook annually providing at least two scenarios for spending revenue deficits and debt the  outlook mainly covers the year period through  the extended baseline scenario assumes that the laws currently on the books will be implemented for the most part the cbo reported in july  that under this scenario if current laws remained generally unchanged in the future federal debt held by the public would decline slightly relative to gdp over the next few years after that however growing budget deficits would push debt back to and above its current high level twentyfive years from now in  federal debt held by the public would exceed  percent of gdp moreover debt would be on an upward path relative to the size of the economy a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely by  the deficit would equal  percent of gdp larger than in any year between  and  and federal debt held by the public would reach  percent of gdp more than in any year except —even without factoring in the economic effects of growing debt the extended alternative fiscal scenario assumes the continuation of present trends which result in a more unfavorable debt position and adverse economic consequences relative to the baseline scenario the cbo reported in july  that under this scenario certain policies that are now in place but are scheduled to change under current law are assumed to continue and some provisions of current law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period are assumed to be modified under that scenario deficits excluding interest payments would be about  trillion larger over the first decade than those under the baseline subsequently such deficits would be larger than those under the extended baseline by rapidly increasing amounts doubling as a percentage of gdp in less than  years cbo projects that real gnp in  would be about  percent lower under the extended alternative fiscal scenario than under the extended baseline with economic feedback and that interest rates would be about threequarters of a percentage point higher reflecting the budgetary effects of those economic developments federal debt would rise to  percent of gdp in  over the longterm the cbo projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories eg medicare medicaid and social security will continue to grow relative to gdp while discretionary categories eg defense and other cabinet departments continue to fall relative to gdp debt is projected to continue rising relative to gdp under the above two scenarios although the cbo did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to gdp ratio down the cbo estimated under the baseline scenario that the us debt held by the public would increase approximately  trillion between the end of  and  under a  trillion deficit reduction scenario during that first decade federal debt held by the public in  would stand at  percent of gdp only slightly above the value of  percent at the end of  under a  trillion deficit reduction scenario for that decade federal debt held by the public would fall to  percent of gdp in  by comparison such debt was  percent of gdp in  and has averaged  percent of gdp during the past  years the cbo reported in september  the nation cannot continue to sustain the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it has been accustomed to paying citizens will either have to pay more for their government accept less in government services and benefits or both risks and debatesedit risks due to increasing entitlement spending according to gaos projections of future trends see also political debates about the united states federal budget and deficit reduction in the united states cbo risk factorsedit the cbo reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a july  publication a growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur if higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges and an increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis in which investors demand higher interest rates concerns over chinese holdings of us debtedit many american and other economic analysts have expressed concerns on account of the peoples republic of chinas extensive holdings of united states government debt as part of their reserves the national defense authorization act of the fiscal year  included a provision requiring the secretary of defense to conduct a national security risk assessment of us federal debt held by china the department issued its report in july  stating that attempting to use us treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to china than to the united states as the threat is not credible and the effect would be limited even if carried out it does not offer china deterrence options whether in the diplomatic military or economic realms and this would remain true both in peacetime and in scenarios of crisis or war the th united states congress introduced legislation whose aim was the assessment of the implications of chinas ownership of us debt the  report claimed that a potentially serious shortterm problem would emerge if china decided to suddenly reduce their liquid us financial assets significantly emphasis in the original text noting also that federal reserve system chairman ben bernanke had in  stated that because foreign holdings of us treasury securities represent only a small part of total us credit market debt outstanding us credit markets should be able to absorb without great difficulty any shift of foreign allocations a significant number of economists and analysts dismiss any and all concerns over foreign holdings of united states government debt denominated in us dollars including chinas holdings sustainabilityedit according to the government accountability office gao the united states is on a fiscally unsustainable path because of projected future increases in medicare and social security spending risks to economic growthedit debt levels may affect economic growth rates in  economists kenneth rogoff and carmen reinhart reported that among the  developed countries studied average annual gdp growth was – when debt was relatively moderate or low ie under  of gdp but it dips to just  when debt was high ie above  of gdp in april  the conclusions of rogoff and reinharts study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by herndon ash and pollin of the university of massachusetts amherst herndon ash and pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used there was no evidence that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth reinhart and rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains however other economists including paul krugman have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase rather than the other way around commenting on fiscal sustainability former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke stated in april  that neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability but given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time interest and debt service costsedit components of interest on the debt despite rising debt levels interest costs have remained at approximately  levels around  billion in total due to lower than longterm interest rates paid on government debt in recent years however interest rates may return to higher historical levels the cost of servicing the us national debt can be measured in various ways the cbo analyzes net interest as a percentage of gdp with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden during  this was  gdp close to the record low  of the – era the average from  to  was  of gdp however the cbo estimated in  that the interest amounts and  gdp will increase significantly over the following decade as both interest rates and debt levels rise interest payments on that debt represent a large and rapidly growing expense of the federal government cbos baseline shows net interest payments more than tripling under current law climbing from  billion in  or  percent of gdp to  billion in  or  percent of gdp—the highest ratio since  definition of public debtedit economists also debate the definition of public debt krugman argued in may  that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use while reinhart has testified to the presidents fiscal reform commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure the center on budget and policy priorities cbpp cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden disagreeing with these commission members there is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt which was approximately  trillion in february  for example the cbpp argues that large increases in debt held by the public can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the united states which reduces americans income by contrast intragovernmental debt the other component of the gross debt has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes and pays interest on to itself however if the us government continues to run on budget deficits as projected by the cbo and omb for the foreseeable future it will have to issue marketable treasury bills and bonds ie debt held by the public to pay for the projected shortfall in the social security program this will result in debt held by the public replacing intragovernmental debt intergenerational equityedit see also intergenerational equity   treasury bond one debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity for example if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations there are several factors to consider for every dollar of debt held by the public there is a government obligation generally marketable treasury securities counted as an asset by investors future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them as of  approximately  of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest  of the population this presents a wealth and income distribution question as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today to the extent the us debt is owed to foreign investors approximately half the debt held by the public during  principal and interest are not directly received by us heirs higher debt levels imply higher interest payments which create costs for future taxpayers eg higher taxes lower government benefits higher inflation or increased risk of fiscal crisis to the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the longterm productivity of the economy and its workers such as via useful infrastructure projects or education future generations may benefit for every dollar of intragovernmental debt there is an obligation to specific program recipients generally nonmarketable securities such as those held in the social security trust fund adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations via higher taxes or lower program spendingcitation needed krugman wrote in march  that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt fiscal policy is indeed a moral
