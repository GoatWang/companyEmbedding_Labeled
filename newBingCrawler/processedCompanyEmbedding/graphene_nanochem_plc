the purchase order for graphsolve from scomi oiltools for field deployment in myanmar graphsolve a nanoenhanced bioremediation solution for the treatment of drill cuttings offers a unique solution of enabling onsite treatment of drill cuttings waste replacing the costly need to transport and treat the same at offsite treatment facilities drill cuttings are heavily oil contaminated wastes generated during a well drilling process which need to be treated prior to disposal to comply with the environmental regulations for treatment of drilling wastes an oil drilling process generates between mt to mt cuttings per well and the conventional method of treatment has been to collect and transport the cuttings to offsite incineration facilities incurring expensive haulage and treatment costs the dual chemistry function of graphsolve effectively reduces the oil content in the cuttings to less than  to meet the environmental regulations for onsite disposal and enhances the biodegradation process to within    weeks providing significant cost savings to operators and an improved carbon footprint as compared to transportation and treatment of cuttings at offsite facilities depending on the concentration of oil in the drill cuttings graphsolve is expected to reduce treatment costs by us to us per mt of cuttings the first order of graphsolve was made following successful testing and full lab trial by scomi global research and technology centre in accordance with the rigorous standard and testing protocols set by the end customer a leading national oil company in the region end

admitted to the aim of the london stock exchange on  march  following the reverse acquisition of biofutures international plc and trades under the symbol grphl to find out more please visit wwwgraphenenanochemcom       chief executive officers statement   business overview  is our marketbuilding year having achieved market breakthrough in  significant progress has been made in the first half of this financial year in the implementation of our growth strategy of focusing on quality revenue stream from higher margin products to build graphene nanochem into a leading international provider of oil recovery solutions in the face of difficult market conditions our nanoenhanced products and solutions with their unique value proposition of enabling superior technical and environmental performance and significant cost reduction continue to gain traction with leading national and international oil and gas companies supported by our partnership with scomi group a leading global oilfield service provider whilst we are making significant progress during this marketbuilding period in terms of establishing presence and developing market share in south east asia india turkmenistan middle east and south america market conditions continue to be challenging for the industry with the oil price having fallen over  creating a volatile environment for operators and service companies we are anticipating current market conditions to continue into  and the group has taken steps in implementing cost control measures in its current business operations which include the restructuring of its debt financing the focus on quality revenue streams and growth sector base and the restructuring of its cost base also sees the group evolving away from the low margin fuel additive business and consequently reducing significant number of headcount from the fuel additive business segment these initiatives do not impact the groups capability in delivering its high margin products and will not affect the companys ability to convert current opportunities into revenue   update fuel additives business despite the stable revenue streams of the last  years the group has successfully managed to exit this lower margin fuel additive business line given the limited margin potential combined with the ongoing focus on quality earning from new higher margin products this is important as is substantially reduces the requirement for working capital and substantially increases the return on investment in deploying capital towards the groups higher margin products and applications oilfield chemicals the oilfield chemicals segment was the first stepup expansion for the group in executing its planned roadmap towards endmarket diversification into high value high margin products the groups drilling additives performance nanofluid products were first developed for commercial deployment into the oilfield chemicals market transitioning into the eor market the group further expanded its eor oilfield chemicals portfolio to include well rejuvenation recovery enhancement and protection fluids the key to our growth strategy is in establishing quality revenue streams from the commercialisation of high margin products and solutions developed by the group for applications in the oil and gas sector significant progress has been made in the first half of this financial year specifically in building the various stages of market acceptance for the products and presence for this new business segment undergoing numerous testing and trials and translating opportunities into revenue streams the group received its first contract from ptt thailand for the deployment in myanmar valued at usd million a further testament to the high performance solution was the testing and evaluation programme being signed with one of the worlds top  international oil companies ioc marking a significant milestone of the phased expansion of drilling additives series into new regions adding to credibility the drilling fluids performance was the recent independent biodegradability testing by the council of scientific  industrial research  national institute of oceanography india which concluded at  the biodegradation level of the platdrill series is  higher than the standard specified by the oecd guidelines the drilling fluids series has made major inroads breaking into the market with successful field formulation testing product approval and tender participation in thailand myanmar malaysia turkmenistan and brazil for continued positive market prospects and growth the award of a trial well by a leading middle eastern oil company as part of the phase  deployment in turkmenistan has been successful the product which provides superior performance in reducing torque and drag and enhances rate of penetration will be used by scomi oiltools as part of their key formulation in the new waterbased mud technology hyperdrill system that is specifically formulated for deviated horizontal well drilling seen as the ideal solution to overcome the challenging conditions of the deviated well covered by this trial with the record breaking performance in torque and drag reduction the drilling fluids series of products has seen the following developments i recently commercially deployed in india by a  national oil and gas noc company for a well drilling programme valued at us  ii awarded well for trial in vietnam with a major local noc iii awarded a well trial in indonesia with commercial deployment to take place by november  and iv awarded a further well trial in pakistan with drilling commencing in q  the product has also made geographical expansion into the markets of several iocs and nocs in indonesia malaysia saudi arabia united arab emirates and qatar with current status ranging from incumbent product comparison testing field formulation testing tender participation and trials well awarded with respect to the eor solution offering platform which enables complete solutions from the removal of emulsion blockages whether from drilling residue or from production waste up to the treatment of such drilling and production waste generated the group has seen efficient performance that enables the end user to benefit from these cost saving initiatives  these solutions have recently completed their testing phase and have moved towards the commercial deployment stage as evidenced by an approximate well drilling programme in thailand followed by the successful testing in myanmar for an ioc drilling campaign scheduled to begin in november  following the positive test results carrying forward the strong momentum from these successful trial and field performances the group is now focused on developing its track record in the mena region after receiving successful technical approval from an ioc in egypt which will now move towards the commercial deployment phase   oilfield services  the need for a reliable and effective water treatment process to the og industry remains a priority given the high cost structure and increase in environmental regulation for operations ongoing operations this provides global opportunity for the groups advanced water treatment solution and systems the groups water treatment systems are to be deployed in the upstream sector on an equipment supply rentalbased business model and has resulted in tender participations in multiple projects in indonesia through the groups partnership with scomi group that has a strong drilling waste management division as part of their core service offerings the groups modular skid mounted water treatment systems have been proposed sampled and are in tender participation for projects in oman egypt pakistan and australia illustrating a good market look and available opportunities in the region an important breakthrough this year has been the extension of the groups treatment solution to the downstream sector the group is now bidding for two large petrochemical plant treatment systems one in egypt and one in thailand these potential contracts are long term in nature some even stretching out to  years the group continues to leverage on our advanced stepchange solutions and partners channel network with leading oil and gas companies to expand market share in the higher margin market segments building on the positive momentums after making the transition from development phase to commercial deployment phase   financial overview the group revenues for the period decreased  to £m  £m the group anticipated the decline in revenues for the period in line with the overall rationalisation of its business to a suite of higher margin products and offerings within the performance chemicals and performance materials divisions as announced in june the group progressively exited the capital intensive low margin fuel additives business during the period as margins continued to decline with the collapse of oil prices the oil price decline has enhanced the need for the groups cost effective platform based performance applications with our jv partner scomi oiltools the groups lack of access to working capital resulted in a scale down in acceptance of sales orders during the period the group is rectifying its current working capital predicament through current engagement with its financial partners with anticipated positive outcomes in the very near term   with the exit from the low margin fuel additives business the group will progressively increase its return on investment roi by deploying much needed capital into identified performance chemicals and performance materials businesses as announce in june the groups current business rationalisation is in line to meet the key financial targets set by the board of directors by  o             improve revenue growth with quality earnings targeting cagr of  o             focus on gradual gross margins increase to  by  o             returns on capital earnings of  and o             reduce net debt to less than x ebitda gross loss for the period was £m gross profit  £m the gross loss incurred for the period was due to the lack of economies of scale to cover fixed direct costs as the group progressively exited the fuel additives business during the period operating expenditure for the period was £m  £m with the wind up of the fuel additives business reductions in overheads have been made across all segments of the business and were initiated during the period as the group transitions from a low marginhigh volume to a highmargin low volume business platform the group expects to reduce operational expenditure year on year the net asset position of £m and a debt to equity ratio of  times for the end of the period provides the group opportunity to leverage its balance sheet to fund the growth plans of the group as announced in june the group is in discussions with its financiers to restructure its current borrowings of £m at the end of the period the proposed debt rescheduling is a key element of the groups capital management plan and will align the groups debt maturities with its current business plans cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period was £m  £m prudent measures have been undertaken to conserve cash prior to the corporate restructuring options that are available to the group in the near term that include debt rescheduling raising new debt finance and the raising of additional funds from the capital markets in june the group indicated it would be reviewing options to raise funds to continue the development of the performance chemicals and the performance materials divisions the future prospects of the group remain robust through impending sales of high margin performance chemicals and long term lease revenues from the performance materials division specifically the proposed water treatment projects the group remains optimistic for project based off balance sheet financing for these projects supported by contractual lease based agreements with tier  customers as stated above the group is focused on achieving a positive outcome for the debt restructuring exercise it is currently undertaking with its financiers and remains confident for a positive outcome in the very near term the total comprehensive loss for the period was £m  £m   summary and outlook since the end of  the group has seen continuing progress in meeting a series of milestones with respect to its eor products launches and rollouts into major markets whilst the group is making significant progress in terms of our existing and new applications the decline of the oil price has created a volatile environment for operators however the sectors most severely impacted are tight gas fracking where well depletion occurs very rapidly and long term multibillion dollar projects in deep offshore environments during the period we secured the breakthrough contract for drilling fluids for delivery in q giving us the opportunity to show the cost effective nature of our application combined with the reduction of costly nonproductive time the recent deployment in india and developments in vietnam indonesia pakistan malaysia saudi arabia uae and qatar serve as our technological and reputational spring board into other major markets that we are targeting both geographically such as mena region and by application in terms of complete enhanced oil recovery sectors importantly we are making the transition in what is recognised being one of the most conservative industries in terms of the speed of adoption of new technology from being viewed as new to being regarded as proven and established which of course help the marketing of our application as a superior standard despite these events and the fact that no company in the oil and gas og sector can be immune from current uncertainties in terms of procuring products and potential contract delays there are a number of positive dynamics that are encouraging for our eor market space as well as for new strategic opportunities that we are targeting such as the entire water treatment spectrum including downstream applications of our product line geographic focus leveraging on the scomis group stronghold in the mena region the group is working together with scomi to exploit opportunities in a region where breakeven prices are reported to be less than  a barrel the price decline has given rise to a whole new sector focuses on the improvement of productivity of existing wells where the groups eor product line enable operators to reduce cost reduce downtime and enhance recovery in a cost effective manner a very substantial number of wells drilled from the s to date provide a large opportunity base that the group together with scomi is focused on exploiting water treatment key drivers in water treatment in the og industry continue to present opportunities for the group the mena region focus gives rise to opportunities from  perspectives  where water available for operation is limited and costly and therefore the requirement for reuse is highly valued  as volumes of oil and gas procured are attained water streams are becoming more difficult to treat with conventional technologies and  increasingly stringent environmental regulations provide the incentives for the industry to necessitate investment the groups success is evident from the inroads it has made in markets in oman saudi arabia egypt and qatar where detailed negotiations are ongoing with oil operations to deploy the groups system to solve the operating issues of the operators in response to the continued difficult market position the group has adopted its position to focus on  the restructuring of its debt facilities  the reduction of cost  the refocusing of its competencies from technology development to commercial exploitation which will enhance its prospects for new contract wins preservation of existing revenue streams in order to enhance shareholder value our progress in the eor market space combined with the extension of the groups water treatment to the downstream segment of the industry further increases industry recognition and presents us with new opportunities which we are actively pursuing as part of our collaboration with the scomi group looking to the future we look forward in updating the market with news of our debt rescheduling exercise and combined with our current contract wins and the successful evolution of our long term recurring earning models whist we dont have a control of our customer timelines or expenditure budgets and project slippage is a challenge facing all oil and gas companies we have adopted a risked approached together with our ongoing cost saving programme which when combined with our anticipated debt restructuring as well our pursuit of fasttomarket opportunities will enable us to continue our growth rapidly the further expansion into downstream business with its long term annual revenue models will enable the group to grow its standing within the industry as leading technology company as
