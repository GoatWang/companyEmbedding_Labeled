francotyppostalia holding ag the first multichannel provider for mail communication impressed the international panel for the red dot award comprising  experts with its new postbase franking system the company has been awarded the accolade in the discipline of “product design ” alongside its innovative design postbase was also judged on the criteria of surface feel functionality and environmental sustainability the award highlights the fact that postbase is much more than just an ordinary franking machine “decades of experience have gone into developing postbase” comments andreas drechsler chief sales officer of francotyppostalia holding ag “we have taken great efforts to ensure that postbase is not only easy to use but that it also meets the requirements of modern office design hence the innovations not only include onebutton technology but also a touch display which makes for an intuitive user interface” mr drechsler goes on to say the colour concept is also remarkable unlike traditional franking machines postbase can be ordered in a range of exclusive colours in line with modern office design postbase combines analogue and digital mail communication allinall the product design goes far beyond the realms of an ordinary machine postbase is a combination of the analogue and digital worlds of mail communication all of the traditional franking machine functions can also be controlled from the pc with the aid of a builtin selfexplanatory operating system users can access all partially and fully electronic communication channels via the fp online portal just like demail for example drechsler was suitably delighted about the awarding of the design prize “the award reaffirms our high expectations of postbase in our view it is testament to the fact that we have defined a new set of standards with postbase” the winning products on display in the red dot design museum the internationally renowned quality seal will be officially bestowed on  july  as part of the traditional red dot gala over  international guests from the worlds of design economics politics and media will gather together at essen’s aaltotheater to celebrate the climax of this year’s competition postbase will then be on display from – july  in the special “design on stage – winners red dot award product design ” exhibition in the red dot design museum in essen learn
