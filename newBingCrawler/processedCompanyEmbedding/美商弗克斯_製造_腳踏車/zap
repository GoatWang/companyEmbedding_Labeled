to get it really clean looking  it’s a lot of work and with out the work the sink is embarrassing i’ve used zap before  loved it  why  because it works on contact with almost no scrubbing  this is a picture of just a few drops on the sink this is the sink that i have to deal with everyday   i put the zap on the entire sink  let it soak for a few minutes  already a remarkable difference this is the sink after letting the zap sit on it for about  minutes with no scrubbing  all that was left to do was to rinse it out   i’d say there’s quite a difference i highly recommend zap  it works just as

with zap i was pretty damn impressed with the information they dig up from the web on the people you connect with the recap emails are really well put together upvote share· years agomike masonmakertipeveryday · dont believe everything you thinkthanks brandonwaselnuk  we think youre really well put together upvote share· years agosidney zhangsidazhang · uberi use android so i cant really test this curious does this require both people to use zap does zap still have utilities if it is just one person upvote share· years agomike masonmakertipeveryday · dont believe everything you thinksidazhang we have an android build it just needs polishing  weeks out if you want to send your card to a recipient that does not have the app we use the ios share sheet to send a deeplink through any app with share sheet integration the recipient is prompted to download the app and receive the card  httpzapppcod upvote share· years agovivek m georgevivekmgeorge · salt  trysaltcomsidazhang tipeveryday why not make it so the other person didnt need download the app to see the card but they could still see where it came from ie hotmail when it launched if get this i might be like i dont want to download another app and not save the contact at all love to hear your thoughts congrats on the launch upvote share· years agosidney zhangsidazhang · ubertipeveryday i wish you could make it so that i dont need to download the app to get the contact i think that actually reduces the utility of this app because as result i am less likely to use zap because i dont want to have to force everybody else to have to download zap upvote share· years agomike masonmakertipeveryday · dont believe everything you thinkvivekmgeorge sidazhang weve thought about this a lot there are ups and downs to it and a few potential security breaches of information weve thought about using a combination of programmatic screenshot with a vcf file works on ios and android this would eliminate the need for the recipient to have the app it will however reduce the value of all the stuff we do in the background like meeting recaps and links to social channels to continue the relationship online if you solve this problem treating business card  as if its a feature parity replacement of the business card then you can never x the value and replace the incumbent the value of “zapping” someone is what happens afterward we give you insights into what the sender has been saying online recap the meeting via detailed email notification and help you further the connection in the days following let me know what you think about this upvote share· years agovivek m georgevivekmgeorge · salt  trysaltcomtipeveryday i wrote a thoughtful two paragraph response twice unfortunately if you touch tab or
