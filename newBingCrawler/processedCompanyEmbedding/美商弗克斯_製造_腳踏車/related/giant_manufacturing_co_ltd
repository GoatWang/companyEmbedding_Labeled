by king liu and several friendswho a major breakthrough came in  when giant’s chief executive tony lo negotiated a deal with schwinn to begin manufacturing bikes as an oem manufacturing bicycles to be sold exclusively under other brand names as a private label as bike sales increased in the us and after workers at the schwinn plant in chicago went on strike in  giant became a key supplier making more than twothirds of schwinn bikes by the mids representing  of giant’s sales when schwinn decided to find a new source and in  signed a contract with the china bicycle company to produce bikes in shenzhen giant under new president bill austin formerly vicepresident marketing at schwinn established its own brand of bicycles to compete in the rapidly expanding andabove price range in  giant also set up a joint venture giant europe with andries gaastra of dutch bicycle manufacturer kogamiyata in  gaastra sold his shares back and giant became a full shareholder of giant europe by  giant had sales in over  countries in over  retail stores in  its global sales surpassed  million bicycles and us million in global revenue and by  it had reached  million bicycles and revenue of us billion modelsedit giant halfway folding bicycle the bike that alexander vinokourov used at the  tour de france in  giant designed the first road bicycle with a sloping top tube featuring a smaller rear triangle the tighter chainstayseatstay configuration is saidby whom to be inherently stiffer than a more conventional frame design and because less material is used the compact road design is also said to be lighter with more responsive cornering and improved acceleration as well as improved aerodynamics the giant design became largely imitated by  with mike burrows giant refined the design for racing by the professional once team once cycling team this was only after initial resistance by the union cycliste internationale and subsequent amendment to its regulations to allow for bicycles with a sloping top tube giant frames were originally made of  aluxx aluminium alloy and were also characterised by bladed forks and seatposts to reduce air resistance frames came in three sizes small medium and large with riders fitted through the use of stems and seatposts of different lengths another mike burrows innovation that was featured on the original tcr bikes included a heightadjustable stem later removed from road racing bicycles due to flex under heavy loads in  the tcr frame was offered in carbon fibre construction and marketed as the tcr composite range in  giant added a highergrade carbon fibre frame marketed as the tcr advanced frame which was characterised by an integrated seatpost isp these frames were most notably raced at the tour de france by tmobiles professional team using this design the seatpost on the new frame must be cut precisely to fit the owner by a trained giant dealer in  the tcr frames with isp continued to be raced internationally most notably by the rabobank team in terms of other innovations giant also introduced its maestro suspension in  maestro suspension according to giant is designed to deliver an efficient rear suspension power transfer maestro utilizes a setup of four pivot points and two linkages to create a floating pivot point that is designed to reduce pedal bob and enables the rear wheel to travel vertically giant currently  categorizes its bicycles first by user men women youth and then by level onroad xroad for men and women bmx for youth offroad within each level are several uses such as

manufacturing  sporting and athletic goods manufacturing giant manufacturing company ltd is an international powerhouse in the specialty bike market with revenues approaching  million giant began as an original equipment manufacturer for wellknown american bike company schwinn and gambled on creating its own brand in the late s within a few years giant was recognized worldwide by cycling enthusiasts and their suppliers while baby boomers grew up with schwinn and huffy bicycles todays generation is far more familiar with giant specialized trek and cannondale creators of highend mountain and road bikes for cyclists of all ages and skill levels in the beginning giant was founded in  in taiwan by entrepreneur king liu at the time the bicycle industry was dominated by such american brands as schwinn and huffy based in the midwest schwinn bicycle company of chicago illinois played a pivotal role in giants future in the early s schwinn ruled the market with its tenspeed bikes but falling sales and rising costs pushed the company to outsource production schwinn turned to two asian firms giant in taiwan and the china bicycle company later shenzhen china bicycle company ltd in china both were hired as oems original equipment manufacturers on a contract basis and so began a tumultuous business relationship the s marked a crucial change in the bicycle industry and for american icon schwinn although the company had thrived in the midwest for eight decades schwinn lost its footing when faced with a strike at its chicago plant in  rather than settle the dispute schwinn closed its chicago factory and moved all production to giant in taiwan while the deal allowed schwinn to keep costs low and maintain its production numbers the shift gave giant a huge boost in productivity and technical expertise not only was giant soon responsible for nearly threequarters of schwinns annual output but its design team was able to gain all the knowledge necessary to build and market specialty bikes of its own although it would be years before giant became an internationally recognized name the company began experimenting with its own branded bike designs in  over the next several years as the relationship between giant and schwinn began to crumble schwinn failed to respond to the changing bicycle market the perennially popular tenspeeds gave way to sturdy mountain bikes and ultralightweight carbon fiber road bikes for cycling enthusiasts bikes giant had the technology and lowcost labor to build when giants founder and chairman king liu announced it would begin building and marketing its own brand bikes schwinn was outraged there was little however the american firm could do other than move part of its business to the china bicycle company in shenzhen forging a new identity – challenged with the loss of most schwinn business though giant did continue to build for the usbased company giant began selling bikes emblazoned with its own name to european dealers in  through a sales office and manufacturing facility in the netherlands the regions consumers tended towards two groups racers who bought technologically advanced road bikes and commuters or leisure riders who wanted attractive yet affordable bicycles giant was able to supply both and quickly established itself as one of europes top importers in  giant set about conquering the united states under the watchful eye of king liu and giant president antony lo although much of its market overlapped with schwinn and other usbased bike firms giant sold its branded high quality products for less and quickly gained market share within a year of selling its own branded bikes in the united states giant went from about  us dealers to more than  the company had opened a us subsidiary in newbury park california and staked its claim to the west coast california proved a boon for giant with a health and fitnesscrazed population terrific weather and miles upon miles of pacific coastline for riding in the early s the peoples republic of china began touting taiwans manufacturing as equal to that of the west in quality and price taiwan had long been considered the home of cheaply made inferior goods yet the country had undergone an industrial and economic transformation giant was a perfect example of this rebirth having emerged from serving as an american supplier to an original manufacturer besting us firms in terms of quality design and cost with the launch of its ready to ride program in  which supplied us dealers with preassembled bikes giant cemented its reputation within the american bike industry dealers did not have to spend hours putting bikes together and customers found an increasing array of sophisticated wellbuilt road and mountain bikes another market coup came with the introduction of its cadex line which revolutionized racing bikes with a supremely lightweight yet durable frame constructed from carbon fiber as giant gained a stronger foothold in europe and north america schwinn struggled in chapter  bankruptcy lo paid tribute to schwinn in forbes magazine december   commenting without schwinn we never would have grown to where we are today we learned many basic things from them quality value service these lessons giant skillfully used to become one of the worlds largest bike exporters the result though was that giant and the china bicycle company became the target of blame for the demise of american bike interests including schwinn giant chuckled all the way to the bank with no regrets as  revenues reached  million the company sold  million bikes during the year more than twothirds of which sold under the giant brand name company perspectives across seven continents and fiftyodd countries underneath thirtytwo of the worlds brightest professional cyclists in over ten thousand retail outlets and throughout the streets of the worlds most populous nations youll find bicycles designed and built by giant the global bicycle company as giant continued to produce more of its own bikes its research and development department later dubbed the techno center began to take center stage giant was one of the first to come out with carbonbased composite bike frames the formulaone frame which was one of giants bestselling frames ever began with thin carbon threads layered into specially shaped tubes which were fused together with even more layers of carbon giants designers believed three major components determined the success of a bicycle frame stiffness weight and ride quality too much of one and a shortage of another spelled disaster and the formulaone proved to be the perfect combination lightweight sleek fast and strong formulaone became a legend in the competitive cycling marketplace international expansion – in early  as offers were made for the assets of bankrupt schwinn giant did not join the fray as expected instead giant concentrated on its own future and had completed construction on a megaplant in kunshan within the jiangsu province to service the burgeoning chinese market the chinese were willing to pay top dollar for mountain bikes made popular in the united states and giant had a billion potential customers to consider by  giant was exploring its options within north america trying to entice the top three us retailers—walmart kmart and sears—into buying imports these three sold only domestically produced bikes an endeavor the united states three largest bike brands huffy murray and roadmaster wanted to maintain unfortunately china was seeking the same opportunities and was accused by the us department of commerce of dumping its bikes at very low prices to steal away us market share for giant however two other major us retailers toys r us and target were receptive to both domestic and imported specialty bikes combined with the independent specialty retailers—giants real bread and butter—imported bikes accounted for about  percent of the us market giant got a boost in july  when usbased investment firm goldman sachs  company spent  million to buy a reported  percent stake in the firm the infusion of cash not only drove research and development but giants affiliation with goldman sachs gave it needed credibility what ultimately separated giant from the asian pack was its technology and ingenuity in  the firm unveiled its compact road design an engineering marvel that shortened frame tubes by altering the angles at which they met one another reducing the tubes not only meant less weight but less flex and a more aerodynamic ride the compact road design revolutionized the cycling industry and virtually every bike manufacturer adopted giants concept of compact geometry for the second half of the decade mountain bike sales fell as road bikes and bmx trick bikes took center stage until the highend bicycle market began to decline many american manufacturers felt the heat of taiwanese chinese and korean bike companies and began closing their us plants in favor of facilities in mexico and asia to keep its brand in the news giant not only poured millions into its techno center but formed joint ventures with a variety of wellknown companies including french automaker renault and american sporting goods clothier eddie bauer to produce cobranded products giant also opened a new manufacturing plant in the netherlands to serve its growing european customers from a technological standpoint giants primary american competitor was trek bicycle corporation headquartered in waterloo wisconsin trek had been around since the late s and had gained a reputation for its specialty bikes as did the aptly named specialized bicycle components based in california near giants us subsidiary another american competitor gaining popularity was the georgetown connecticutbased cannondale corporation known for its uniquely crafted highend bikes while all three firms bristled at giant selling its own brand alongside theirs especially trek and
