longshort equity value research analyst deep valuemarketplacevalue investing  summarythis company is priced like a highflying silicon valley startup with disruptive new technologywe think expectations for future profit growth embedded in the stock price have moved beyond what the company can reasonably be expected to achievecsgp represents a classic poor riskreward trade offdespite being in business for nearly thirty years and having a core product dependent on manual human labor this company is priced like a highflying silicon valley startup with disruptive new technology with organic growth slowing and an acquisition strategy picking up the slack we think expectations for future profit growth embedded in the stock price have moved beyond what the company can reasonably be expected to achieve we see an unbalanced riskreward scenario that does not favor investors costar group nasdaqcsgp is this week’s danger zone pick acquisitions drive growth and margin volatility costar group has grown revenue by  compounded annually over the past ten years most of this growth  in dollar terms has come over the past five years and has been heavily influenced by the acquisition of four real estate listing websites totaling  billion in deal value  of the  billion went to goodwill and other intangible assets aftertax profits nopat have grown  compounded annually over the past decade due to an increase in nopat margins from  in  to  in  nopat margin has recovered from ’s deep decline which was driven by high marketing costs to promote newly acquired brands csgp now generates a similar nopat margin  on  million of ttm revenue as it did on  million of revenue in   this lack of meaningful operating leverage should give investors pause when considering the potential for future margin or return on invested capital roic improvement per figure  below csgp has failed to earn the cost of capital for over five years figure  roic is below wacc sources new constructs llc and company filings free cash flow consumed by acquisitions over the past five years csgp has burned through  billion of cumulative free cash flow fcf largely due to the acquisition strategy of rolling up commercial real estate and apartment listing websites more recently the pace and size of acquisitions have slowed and fcf has increased to  million over the trailing twelve months despite this increase the stock’s  fcf yield remains below the sp   and its datainformation provider peer group  roic depressed by inefficient balance sheet csgp’s current  roic is in fourthquintile of our coverage universe and is well below the datainformation provider peer group median  roic and the sp   roic at first glance csgp’s low returns seem counterintuitive given a nopat margin  in the tophalf of sp  companies and nopat growth of  compounded annually over the past decade however while margins look reasonable the balance sheet does not invested capital has increased by  compounded annually over the past decade from just  million in  to  billion today the exploding balance sheet makes margin improvement well beyond current levels imperative to value creation if balance sheet efficiency eg invested capital turns revenueinvested capital declines then margins have to rise enough to offset that decline otherwise roic declines even if margins rise per figure  csgp generated a  roic in  with a nopat margin of  on  invested capital turns however csgp’s current nopat margin of  only translates into a  roic given the decline in invested capital turns to  figure  displays the significant disconnect between margins and capital turns since the company began the acquisition campaign in  figure  decline in invested capital turns is more than rise in nopat sources new constructs llc and company filings figure  paying too much for revenue destroys shareholder value sources new constructs llc and company filings roicvaluation regression per figure  roic explains nearly  of the valuation difference among the selected data and information provider peer group despite csgp’s relatively low roic  vs  median for the peer group the stock trades at a significant premium as shown by csgp’s position above the trend line in figure  if csgp stock were at parity with the group it would trade at share –  below the current price figure  correlation between roic  valuation sources new constructs llc and company filings executive comp aligned with the wrong metrics we know from figure  above and numerous case studies that changes in roic are directly correlated to changes in market value accordingly we favor executive compensation plans that use roic to measure performance to ensure executives’ interests are aligned with shareholders’ interests revenue and nongaap performance targets can be an incentive to sacrifice profitability for volume or worse engage in acquisitions that destroy shareholder value csgp executive compensation plans are tied to exceeding their own internal expectations for metrics they define such as adjusted ebitda cash incentives nongaap net income restricted stock grants and threeyear revenue growth adjusted for stock price performance restricted stock grants when the focus shifts from organic growth to acquisitions and nongaap measures such as adjusted ebitda it is time for investors to call out management’s selfserving incentive structure csgp’s executive compensation plans incentivizes management to invest capital in suboptimal roic endeavors in order to achieve revenue or nongaap earnings targets per figure  the implications are clear csgp has generated  million of negative economic earnings over the past five years while gaap earnings have risen considerably figure  tenyear gaap vs economic earnings sources new constructs llc and company filings competitive pressures likely to build putting margin expansion at risk first mover advantage is imperiled by failing to identify and counter new competition while much attention has been paid to the explosion of financial technology startups the rise of real estate technology startups has been less noted investors allocated over  billion to such firms over the past few years and almost half of the top  real estate technology companies are less than five years old this increasing number of real estate technology startups seems likely to challenge csgp’s market share or at least its margins given that significant margin expansion is required for csgp to drive roic improvement we view the company’s balance sheet dynamics as a meaningful competitive disadvantage the bloated balance sheet and resulting low ratio of invested capital turns will make it more difficult to counter competitive pressures by competing on price or ramping up investment in new product development figure  balance sheet inefficiency represents competitive disadvantage sources new constructs llc and company filings while csgp is currently generating the highest nopat margin  of the past decade it came one year after posting the lowest  due to cost containment issues tied to the build out of new initiatives particularly advertising and promotion costs questionable spending continued into  perhaps best characterized by a  million super bowl ad featuring rapper lil wayne no less for a very niche product vs one with a wide audience we remain cautious on the level of spending required to maintain revenue momentum and think market expectations are overly optimistic on potential margin improvement bull case based on hope the bull case for csgp is based on a continuation of solid organic revenue growth in the core commercial real estate cre data business with accelerating revenue growth in the apartment listings business we are cautious on growth prospects for the core business due to market saturation and are not sold of the longterm prospects of apartment listing websites a business with naturally low barriers to entry the market for cre data is much smaller than the residential side of the market we believe csgp has limited upside with the largest cre firms cb richard ellis jones lang lasalle etc while pricing the product above where many smaller regional cre brokerage firms find it an attractive value the bull case is also predicated on margin expansion due to management’s focus on generating  “incremental adjusted ebitda margins” on new revenue growth we believe investors should view this flawed metric skeptically and remain focused on nopat margins in order to generate roic above the weighted average cost of capital wacc csgp must now generate a higher nopat margin than it ever has historically this challenge requires significant additional revenue without growing expenses or investing significant additional capital even if csgp were to operate at the average nopat margin of the five highest performing companies in figure  a  nopat margin over x csgp’s current level the resulting  roic would remain well be below the average  roic generated by the same five companies bear case classic poor riskreward tradeoff the bear case for csgp is based on the combination of extremely high market expectations for future cash flows and the misleading nature of the firm’s gaap and nongaap earnings when compared to economic earnings in addition the expectation of increased competition for csgp’s core cre data products from new market entrants slowing growth in the core business due to market saturation and the questionable longterm outcome of investing heavily in apartment listing websites add to the bear case we believe that all of these concerns have merit but do not believe any necessarily have to go badly against the company for the stock to underperform as such csgp represents a classic poor riskreward trade off we prefer to buy stocks with low expectations and sell stocks with high expectations the expectations for revenue growth and margin expansion reflected in expectations for csgp represent a very high bar for organic growth and management execution and ignore the various risks and economic profit realities of the company’s acquisition activities to date is csgp worth acquiring the proprietary value of the core product costar suite  of revenue is debatable while the digital apartment listing business is crowded and competitive with low barriers to entry while csgp does operate an array of well trafficked real estate websites the real engine behind the core database product costar suite is the large department of  researchers and contractors engaged in labor intensive data collection and manual entry cold calling public records searches field visits etc while csgp is the dominant player in cre data and apartment listings we do not believe csgp has the kind of proprietary “tech” value that occasionally results in companies selling at nonsensical multiples to much larger acquirers could an sp global spgi consider beefing up their commercial real estate data offerings via acquiring csgp yes could spgi make economic sense of acquiring csgp in anything other than a takeunder the math makes it very unlikely given that a deal for csgp at the current price would be very dilutive to spgi’s roic from both a nopat margin and balance sheet perspective walking through the acquisition value math to begin costar group has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest  million in offbalancesheet operating leases  of market cap  million in outstanding employee stock options  of market cap  million in deferred tax liabilities  of market cap after adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios even in the most optimistic of scenarios csgp is not worth the current share price figures  and  show what we think sp global should pay for csgp to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value sp global could immediately integrate costar’s data to bolster its real estate data offerings and bring increased scale to the business however there are limits on how much spgi would pay for csgp to earn a proper return given the nopat or free cash flows being acquired each implied price is based on a ‘goal roic’ assuming different levels of revenue growth in each scenario the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals  which is the consensus estimate of revenue growth in the next two years for the subsequent years we use  in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year’s expectations we use  in scenario two because it assumes a merger with spgi could create revenue growth through increased sales  marketing efforts and a larger customer base we conservatively assume that sp global can grow costar’s revenue and nopat without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price we also assume costar immediately achieves a  nopat margin which is the average of spgi and csgp’s current nopat margin for reference costar’s current nopat margin is  so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly bestcase scenario figure  implied acquisition prices for spgi to achieve  roic sources new constructs llc and company filings figure  shows the ‘goal roic’ for spgi as its weighted average cost of capital or  even if costar can grow revenue by  compounded annually with a  nopat margin for the next five years the firm is worth less than its current price of share it’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a  roic would be only value neutral and not accretive as the return on the deal would equal spgi’s wacc figure  implied acquisition prices for spgi to achieve  roic sources new constructs llc and company filings figure  shows the next ‘goal roic’ of  which is spgi’s current roic acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to spgi shareholders even in the bestcase growth scenario the most spgi should pay for csgp is share  downside even assuming this bestcase scenario spgi would destroy over  billion by purchasing spgi at its current valuation any scenario assuming less than  cagr in revenue would result in further capital destruction for spgi very high expectations embedded in valuation despite consensus expectations for  revenue and eps being lower now than one year ago the stock has outperformed the sp  rising  ytd and  over the last year at the current price we believe csgp’s valuation embeds a dangerous level of market expectations due to the chasm between historical financial performance and the expected performance implied by its market value to justify its current price of share csgp must maintain current nopat margins of  and grow nopat by  compounded annually for the next  years in this scenario csgp would be generating over  billion in annual revenue over x sp global’s current revenue the market for csgp’s current products is simply not large enough for such a scenario to be plausible even if we assume csgp can more than double its nopat margin to  the average of the top  performing companies in figure  and grow nopat by  annually for the next decade the stock is still worth only  today – a  downside risk this scenario assumes csgp grows revenues to over  billion in ten years from  million or  compounded annually each of these scenarios assumes csgp is able to grow revenue nopat and free cash flow without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets this assumption is unlikely particularly in light of figure  but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are csgp offers no yield to shareholders csgp does not currently pay a cash dividend nor have a buyback program in place as such the stock offers none of the downside protection that a solid shareholder yield can provide given the level of risk we see in the valuation and forward expectations this downside protection could be sorely missed insider trading and short interest trends insiders own  of outstanding shares including a  interest held by ceo florance ownership has been diluted by acquisition issuance over time while insiders have been steady net sellers for well over a decade insiders owned  million shares or  in  compared to  million today we could not find a single openmarket purchase by an insider over the same period short interest is not high at  of outstanding shares or  days to cover the level of short interest has bounced around from  to
