world  metatech nephilim the book of enoch  end of the world november   by user fallen angels no comment nephilim the book of enoch  the end of the world from before its news webmaster’s note nephilim are the offspring that resulted from the mating of fallen angels with humans they were giants often with six fingers six toes double rows of teeth and massive appetites for blood one basic truth can be used as a foundation for a mountain of lies and if we dig down deep enough in the mountain of lies and bring out that truth to set it on top of the mountain of lies the entire mountain of lies will crumble under the weight of that one truth and there is nothing more devastating to a structure of lies than the revelation of the truth upon which the structure of lies was built because the shock waves of the revelation of the truth reverberate and continue to reverberate throughout the earth for generations to follow awakening even those people who had no desire to be awakened to the truth from ancient rome to greece – and before that to egypt assyria babylonia and sumer – the earliest records of human civilization tell of the era when powerful creatures known to the hebrews as watchers and in the book of genesis as the sons of god mingled themselves with humans giving birth to partcelestial partterrestrial hybrids known as the nephilim – derived from the hebrew root word ‘naphal’ meaning ‘the fallen ones’ genesis  says this happened when men began to multiply on earth and daughters were born unto them when the sons of god saw the women’s beauty they took wives from among them to give birth to their most unusual offspring the whole of the ancient record is understood to mean that the watchers wanted to leave their proper sphere of existence in order to enter earth’s threedimensional reality they viewed women – or at least their genetic material – as part of the formula for accomplishing this task spiritual things are not allegorical abstractions rather reference is being made to beings or things that do not originate in our dimension those entities have their origin in other dimensions known as the spiritual realm revslider slider that realm is able to interact with ours in ways that we do not fully understand the prophecy of genesis  states that the serpent will one day mix his seed with humanity to produce a counterfeit of the messiah in the book of daniel  we read that there will once again come a time when the fallen angels will mingle with the seed of men also the messiah told us that the last days will be like the days of noah when fallen angels would once again mix their seed with humanity genesis  “and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years there were nephilim in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men gibborim which were of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them” the nephilim that were produced by the angelmankind marriage were much different from either of their parents this act of defiance clearly went against god’s plan for the earth in which each animal and human being was to reproduce ‘after its own kind’ this is perhaps the best demonstration that the parents of these creatures were not simply descendants of cain and seth had they been they would have produced human offspring rather than the nephilim the nephilim were more than simply large beings or giants when the greek septuagint was created the hebrew word nephilim was translated into greek as gegenes this is the same word used in greek mythology for the ‘titans’ creatures created through the interbreeding of the greek gods and human beings the english words ‘genes’ and ‘genetics’ are built around the same root word as gegenes genea means ‘bread’ or ‘kind’ from the book of enoch enoch  “and it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters and the angels the children of the heaven saw and lusted after them and said to one another ‘come let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children” jubilees  “and it came to pass when the children of men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the angels of god saw them on a certain year of this jubilee that they were beautiful to look upon and they took themselves wives of all whom they chose and they bare unto them sons and they were giants” wf albright “the israelites who heard this section recited unquestionably thought of intercourse between angels and women” antenicenes “…impure love of virgins and were subjugated by the flesh… of those lovers of virgins therefore were begotten those who are called giants… the angels transgressed and were captivated by love of women and begat children”  enoch  “and i enoch was blessing the lord of majesty and the king of the ages and lo the watchers called me – enoch the scribe – and said to me enoch thou scribe of righteousness go declare the watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven the holy eternal place and have defiled themselves with women and have done as the children of earth do and have taken unto themselves wives ye have wrought great destruction on the earth and ye shall have no peace nor forgiveness of sin and inasmuch as they delight themselves in their children nephilim the murder of their beloved ones shall they see and over the destruction of their children shall they lament and shall make supplication unto eternity but mercy and peace shall ye not attain” jubilees    “the sons of god were sent down to teach mankind truth and justice and for three hundred years did indeed teach cain’s son enoch all the secrets of heaven and earth later however they lusted after mortal women and defiled themselves by sexual intercourse enoch has recorded not only divine instructions but also their subsequent fall from grace before the end they were indiscriminately enjoying virgins matrons men and beasts” exodus  “whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death” the book of enoch was an ancient best seller before it was lost to be rediscovered alongside the dead sea scrolls the same year as the incident at roswell in the centuries immediately preceding and following the coming of christ this book was widely read and discussed and its impact was tremendous without question it is the most notable apocalyptical work outside the canonical scriptures r h c charles an outstanding authority in this field tells us that “the influence of  enoch on the new testament has been greater than that of all the other apocryphal and pseudepigraphical books put together” jude  contains a direct quote from enoch   and  yet with all the incredible mysteries this book remained neglected for more than  years and continues to remain neglected and even shunned in the twentieth century enoch is listed in the bible as the seventh of the ten patriarchs between adam and noah he was the father of methuselah the man holding the world’s record for longevity  the most remarkable fact of all is that enoch did not die – ‘enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him’ he is one of the only two men mentioned in the bible who were translated to heaven without tasting death  the books of enoch click here the book of enoch like the genesis apocryphon refers to these ‘sons of god’ as watchers – a term also used in the book of daniel enoch alleges that two hundred of these watchers descended to earth in the days of jared genesis  and some of them are given names the worst ones of all were shernihaza the leader of the evil angels and azazel who was accused of having ‘scattered over the earth the secrets of heaven and hath rebelled against the mighty one’ god was moved to anger at these watchers because of the horrible practices that they had introduced upon the earth and there was something else god was angry at the fact that they had disclosed certain secrets and were teaching them to their sons the nephilim we are not told exactly what these secrets were except that they were ‘eternal secrets’ which men of earth were striving to learn and which god did not intend for fallen man to discover enoch  “and all the others together with them took unto themselves wives and each chose for himself one and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them…and they became pregnant and they bare great giants whose height was three thousand ells  feet who consumed all the acquisitions of men and when men could no longer sustain them the giants turned against them and devoured mankind and they began to sin against birds and beasts and reptiles and fish and to devour one another’s flesh and drink the blood then the earth laid accusation against the lawless ones” genesis  “and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth” jubilees  “and lawlessness increased on the earth and all flesh corrupted its way alike man and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walks on the earth – all of them corrupted their ways and their orders and they began to devour each other and lawlessness increased on the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of all men was thus evil continually”  corinthians  “all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another” this clearly indicates that genetic experiments that place human dna deoxyribonucleic acid into animals is an abomination toward god’s mosaic laws that this is now being done means that our hitech scientific experiments with genetic transfer of human dna into animals also means that we have again entered into a period that is ‘as the days of noah were’ this is a clear indication that we may be approaching the time of the great tribulation when satan will make his final assault on mankind these same watchers approached enoch to mediate on their behalf and to write out a petition in their favor god however rejects the petition and enoch is summoned to speak to the watchers again ‘go say to the watchers of heaven who have sent thee to intercede for them ye should intercede for men and not men for you wherefore have ye left high holy and eternal heaven and lain with women and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men and taken wives unto yourselves and done like the children of earth begotten giants as sons and although ye were holy spiritual living and eternal life you have defiled yourselves with the blood of women and have begotten children with the blood of flesh have lusted after flesh and blood as those who do die and perish’ and as for the nephilim produced by them ‘the giants who are produced from the spirits and flesh shall be called evil spirits upon the earth…evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies because they are born from men and from holy watchers is their beginning and primal origin…and the spirits of the giants afflict oppress attack do battle and work destruction upon the earth…and these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women because they have proceeded from them…this shall they destroy until the day of consummation the great judgment in which the age shall be consummated over the watchers and the godless yea shall be wholly consummated and now as to the watchers…say to them therefore ye have no peace’ enoch  “and the lord said unto michael ‘go bind shernihaza and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness and when their sons have slain one another and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth till the day of their judgment and of their consummation till the judgment that is forever and ever is consummated” zadokite document “because they walked in the stubbornness of their heart the watchers of heaven fell yea they were caught thereby because they kept not the commandments of god so too their sons whose bodies were as mountains they also fell” philo philo was a first century jewish philosopher from alexandria who was known for trying to make the bible harmonize with greek philosophy by way of allegorization if anyone should have allegorized away the sons of god and the giants it was philo and he did nothing of the sort he wrote “those beings whom other philosophers call demons moses usually calls angels and they are souls hovering in the air on what principle was it that giants were born of angels and women the poets call those men who were born out of the earth giants that is to say sons of the earth…these giants were sprung from a combined procreation of two natures namely from angels and mortal women for the substance of angels is spiritual but it occurs every now and then that on emergencies occurring they have imitated the appearance of men and transformed themselves so as to assume the human shape as they did on occasion when forming connections with women for the production of giants” diodorus “although their wives are comely they have very little to do with them but rage with lust in outlandish fashion for the embraces of males and the most astonishing thing of all is that they feel no concern for their proper dignity but prostitute to others without a qualm the flower of their bodies nor do they consider this a graceful thing to do but rather when anyone of them is thus approached and refuses the favor offered him this they consider an act of dishonor” flavius josephus “for many angels of god accompanied with women and begat sons that proved unjust and despisers of all that was good on account of the confidence they had in their own strength for the tradition is that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom the grecians call giants” the testament of twelve patriarchs the testament of reuben “for thus they allured the watchers who were before the flood for as these continually beheld them they lusted after them and they conceived the act in their mind and the women lusting in their minds after their forms gave birth to giants for the watchers appeared to them as reaching even unto heaven” could you imagine what girls would do if thor came down from asgard and offered himself up to the women of los angeles isaiah  “o lord our god other lords beside thee have had dominion over us but by thee only will we make mention of thy name they are dead they shall not live they are deceased rephaim they shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and made all their memory to perish” the word ‘rephaim’ has been translated to mean deceased however this word can also mean ‘giants’ or nephilim and when one reads it as such it takes on a much different meaning this reading reveals why god found it necessary to destroy these creatures from the earth in order to save mankind the reason is that the giants created by the interbreeding of humans and angels will not ‘live again’ ie they won’t partake in the resurrection of the dead for some reason the rephaim will not be brought back to life for judgment for the same reason it was essential for the israelites to wipe out the nephilim which they found in the promised land unfortunately they did not appear to succeed or if they did satan was able to make an ‘end run’ around the actions to produce more nephilim throughout the world following this period with the information isaiah reveals about the giants we now see that the nephilim could not be resurrected and also influence people to do evil because the bible makes it clear that the offspring of the nephilim were also giants this situation undoubtedly snowballed with more interbreeding between the giants and human beings as well as through the wickedness the nephilim exerted on those around them the only solution was to wipe the creatures and those they had corrupted from the face of the earth httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvkmpiwufw  samuel  “and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth” leviticus  “a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit or that is a wizard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them” this mosaic law also had an admonition against relationships with ‘spirits’ which is generally interpreted to mean engaging in witchcraft however a careful reading of this suggests it might also encompass the fallen angelwoman couplings that took place in noah’s time or if not the actual sex act this law may be designed in preventing man and women from having the intimate contact with angels that will eventually lead to a sexual relationship as well if so it is interesting to note that many in the new age movement have taken this first step through the adoption of ‘familiar spirits’ and ‘spirit guides’ what people commonly think of as ghosts are sometimes what remains of the nephilim as such it is important to remember that such spirits would be purely evil by the same token it would appear that the new age’s ‘spirit guides’ might in fact be the evil spirits of the rephaim taking advantage of human ignorance to mislead and do damage this may explain why séances and other witchcraft that purports to contact the dead is forbidden by god it can be easy to confuse these beings since angels sometimes operate on the spiritual realm however it appears that in cases of demon possession or similar activities the spiritual being is actually that of a nephilim whose body has been destroyed unfortunately modern man is quite vulnerable to the devil’s lies and attacks the ‘wisdom’ of our time has convinced modern man that demons and the devil are nonexistent we have been conditioned to think that those once dismissed as demonpossessed were simply mentally ill that makes it impossible for many to take any action to protect themselves from satanic influences after all if something doesn’t exist there’s no need to worry about it right out of all the sins committed by these watchers defiling themselves with earth women seems to have been the purpose for this extreme punishment – any altering of god’s creation seems to do the trick though when we are not of the flesh created by god we cannot be taken by the holy spirit we must remember we were created perfectly in god’s image and likeness what he looks like and how he acts but the fall of sin corrupted that image light that was coming from adam was not being produced from his own self but was absorbed from god and then reemitted very much like how things glow in the dark the fact that dna emits light is now a wellestablished fact when adam sinned the holy spirit left him and the direct connection to the light source was broken when the serpent said ‘ye shall be as gods’ adam and eve were already like god the light that is now emitted from living things is not coming from the ultimate light source which is god himself but presumably from the sun after the fall death errors in the genetic code entered our first parents and those errors have not only been passed to all of the descendants but the loss of data has been increasing over time as would be consistent with data loss in the world of computers humanity has been suffering from an information loss in our own source code this is what the mayan prophecy is really all about it’s an awakening a return to the original source if satan had by any means prevented the birth of jesus he would obviously have averted his own doom satan did succeed to a large extent it was for this reason that god drowned mankind in the great deluge  peter  “for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an exsample unto those that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities” jude  “i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities” the basic intention for the corruption of antediluvian dna by the watchers was an effort to cut off the birth line of the messiah this is why god told adam and eve to be fruitful and to fill the earth multiply the dna manipulation was to create a hybrid form that neither the spirit of man nor god would inhabit because it was neither man nor beast and thus provided an unusual body made up of human animal and plant genetics known as nephilim an earthborn ‘fit extension’ into which the watchers could extend themselves – much like the idea of demonic possession only noah – and by extension his children – were found ‘perfect’ in their generation from jesus’ words we see that there will be no need for any more procreation once we reach heaven because we will be eternal luke  nowhere in the bible does it say that angels are incapable of mixing their seed with humans what we learn from peter and jude is that they were not supposed to the fallen angels sons of god literally left their proper domain – a spirit realm that is parallel to our own – and camefell to earth where they fathered their nephilim offspring with human woman but as you read in genesis  there were nephilim in the earth in those days and also after that… jubilees  “the malignant evil ones were bound in the place of condemnation but a tenth part of them were left that they might be subject before satan on the earth these are for corruption and leading astray men before satan’s judgment” what we know from the book of enoch and jubilees is that  of satan’s angels were allowed to stay to influence the beliefs of men if this were not so then lucifer would have been completely stripped of his freewill he would have already been tossed into the bottomless pit and the game would be over but this is not the case satan is here to lead men astray until his time has come and we must be able to recognize it if we wish to be redeemed by the lord while it may appear that the demons who crossed the line when mingling with humans were thrown into the pit other demons must have taken women and gave birth to nephilim after the flood we know from scripture that there was nephilim in the land of canaan when the children of israel came to take possession of their promised land upon seeing the nephilim they lost their faith that god could win the battle for them and so they were taken back to the wilderness where they wandered for another forty years the nephilim were the sole reason why the children of israel did not possess the land right after leaving egypt the presence of nephilim disheartened the twelve spies who consequently gave a bad report numbers  “the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak which come of the nephilim and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight” deuteronomy  “the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many and tall as the anakims which also were accounted giants as the anakims but the moabites called them emims” josephus “for which reason they removed their camp to hebron and when they had taken it they slew all the inhabitants there were till then left the race of giants who had bodies so large and countenances so entirely different from other men that they were surprising to the sight and terrible to the hearing the bones of these men are still shown to this very day unlike to any credible relations of other men” apparently the bones of these creatures were made available for people to see in josephus’s time these giants have not always been the great secret that they are today the numerous stories sharing incredible similarities from all across the planet should attest to that amos  “yet destroyed i the amorite before them whose height was like the height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet i destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath also i brought you up from the land of egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the amorite”  samuel  “and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant” when they came back to the land forty years later the nephilim were still there but the children of israel finally trusted in god just as god destroyed the earth with a flood to wipe the nephilim from the face of the earth during noah’s time so he used the flood of invading jews flowing into the promised land to wipe out the giants they encountered realizing that some of the cities in the promised land were filled with nephilim explains why god ordered some of the cities totally destroyed with the citizens in them to be put under the edge of the sword god didn’t want any of these monsters to once again pollute the human gene pool god dealt out the same total destruction to these beings as he had with noah’s flood the culture that ruled much of the promised land when the israelites invaded it was comprised of two classes with the anakim acting as a ruling elite within a larger human population  samuel contains reference to the genetic mutations that developed among humans following this time frame including ‘men’ of unusual size physical strength six fingers six toes animal appetite for blood double dentition and even lionlike features   joshua and caleb were the only two spies that moses sent to the land of canaan who were willing to obey god and fight these giants out of shear faith in the lord’s protection – much like what we know from the story of david and goliath by the end of this forty year period all of the israelites had died except for joshua and caleb who remained to lead this new generation to victory over the amorites the fact that god commanded the israelites to destroy man woman and child becomes logical if we understand that – as the text clearly says – all people in the land were not merely sons of adam but were a mix between the sons of god fallen angels and human women just like in the days of noah og king of bashan was the last recorded giant east of the jordan river joshua   after joshua’s conquest of canaan joshua – a few giants continued living in the philistine cities of gaza gath and ashdod these giants terrorized the israelites from the time they entered into canaan until late in the reign of king david one of those giants was goliath whom david killed king david and his “mighty men” also encountered other giants  samuel – chronicles – though we are essentially told that they were all killed off during his armies reign everything after this point becomes a mystery and all we can really do is use our biblical discretion to discern truth from fiction steve quayle “this brings us to a big question if the nephilim actually existed both in prenoah times as well as during the civilizations created by noah’s family’s offspring after the flood why are there not fossils graves artifacts and other evidence that they existed in fact all of these are present it’s just that modern scientists historians and theologians like to ignore them hide the evidence or keep the information under wraps why because the evidence is far from comfortable and doesn’t fit in nicely with the idea that man is evolving changing without influence from outside powers and that the bible is irrelevant to modern societies furthermore their existence must be covered up in order to lay the groundwork for satan’s final assault against humanity among the documented discoveries of the last two centuries are  in  soldiers digging at lompock rancho california discovered a male skeleton  feet tall the skeleton had double rows of upper and lower teeth  a ninefoot eight inch skeleton was excavated from a mount near brewersville indiana in   in clearwater minnesota the skeletons of seven giants were found in mounds these had receding foreheads and complete double dentition  miners in lovelock cave california discovered a very tall redhaired mummy in  this mummy eventually went to a fraternal lodge where it was used for ‘initiation purposes’  in  a local newspaper reported the discovery of ninefoottall skeletons by amateur archeologists working in death valley the archeologists involved also claimed to have found what appeared to be the bones of tigers and dinosaurs with the human remains  in  skeletons from eight and a half to ten feet long were found in the humbolt lake bed in california  the catalina islands off california are the home of dwarf mammoth bones that were once roasted in ancient fire pits these were roasted and eaten by humanlike creatures who were giants with double rows of teeth” according to deuteronomy  bashan was called the land of the giants if we research the area we will run across a structure known as gilgal refaim this structure is made of megalithic stones weighing a total of  metric tons stacked ft high with a diameter of ft and a ft high tumulus tomb in the center a tumulus is a mound raised over a grave or graves the best way to observe gilgal refaim is by being very tall or being airborne it is fascinating that there is a giant burial mound in the middle of golan just where the bible says there were giants living if someone somewhere discovered absolute proof of a hybrid person or animal could we actually rely on the governments of the world to share this information more than likely the answer is no there have been numerous reports of giant skeletons being discovered all over the world but how many are on display for us to see almost as numerous as the stories of these discoveries are the stories of findings being confiscated and people being told not to talk about it why exactly is our human history being covered up is it because there is a sinister power behind those that appear to be in power what if we knew the true intentions of these beings that ancients claim enslaved mankind would we fight back or would we conform gary stearman had this to say about ruins in the region that the canaanites occupied during these ancient times “today tourists marvel at the ruins in this region they are of truly gigantic proportion as we have written earlier ‘here and northward into syria and lebanon there are the remains of ancient buildings and temples that stagger the imagination for example the ruins of baalbek in lebanon’s beqa a valley are so massive that some have suggested they could not be duplicated even using modern building techniques on the acropolis of baalbeck stood a temple dedicated to the storm god hadad it was  feet wide and  feet long surrounded by  columns each  feet high and over seven feet in diameter but its flooring stones – still intact – are each larger than a modern railroad boxcar no one can imagine how they were moved into place” job  “now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it” satanlucifer was once in the very presence of god acting as a covering cherub ezekiel  as well as the chief of all the angels ezekiel  at some point satan became selfdeluded thinking that he could ascend up the very throne and importance of god isaiah  iniquity was found in his heart ezekiel  he was cast out of god’s presence ezekiel  to become the prince of the power of the air ephesians  which he remains until this day apparently lucifer retained his ability to shapeshift  corinthians  cross dimensions job  and  and manipulate time luke  he then set out to trick adam and eve whom god had created in his image and had placed in the garden of eden genesis  “in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters” the phrase ‘in the beginning’ really is closer to being a ‘big inning’ than just the point at which things started it tells that god made the heavens and the earth but doesn’t give an inkling as to when or how the idea is bolstered by the fact that when hebrew writers wanted to note the actual beginning of a time as the time of day or week when a harvest commenced for example the word employed was most often ‘techillah’ this word connotes an opening or commencement and this passage avoids the use of this word ‘techillah’ wasn’t the word moses chose to tell about the beginning of the heavens and the earth in other words this opening passage of the bible isn’t necessarily telling about the start of things as is often thought but rather denotes that a period took place during which that first state of being took place and during which god created the heavens and the earth in the second verse the word ‘waw’ is translated ‘and’ however ‘waw’ doesn’t necessarily mean ‘and’ it can also mean ‘but’ the ‘and’ was chosen simply because the translators felt it fit well there when reading it in the context of the two verses together this alternate reading with ‘but’ suggests that even though god had created the heavens and the earth in a perfect form during the previous period as described in verse  an event took place before verse  that has caused the whole world to become chaotic it can then be seen that something has changed and that while this is a beginning for the saga of mankind there was in every likelihood a previous existence of some sort god has no real end but is eternal one must therefore assume that the ‘beginning’ before his works simply means before what can be seen in this age was created not before god so this suggests that some cataclysmic event has taken place causing the old world to be totally wasted and uninhabitable the original creation which had been perfect had ‘become’ desolate and void i believe that whatever event that it was that caused everything to become ‘without form and void’ has something to do with the asteroid belt and what’s on mars the hebrew word ‘tohuw’ is translated as ‘without form’ this word appears elsewhere in the bible and takes on some finer associations and meanings including formlessness confusion unreality and emptiness it also is associated with the unreal as with an idol as well as wasteland and solitary wilderness in the adverbial form ‘tohuw’ means ‘wastefully’ or ‘in vain’ thus while the word used here means primarily a wasteland there are undercurrents and hints of idolatry pride and sin through the choice of this word the hebrew word ‘bohuw’ is generally employed throughout the bible in connection with the desolation of a city or nation it also connotes an undercurrent of judgment from god as in isaiah  where the lord’s judgment results in desolation thus when the earth was ‘void’ it was desolate that this is a judgment from god is further bolstered by the idea that darkness is upon the face of the earth since this is associated with evil in the bible while god is associated with light thus the ‘without form and void’ suggests not just physical desolation but spiritual as well the ‘deep’ or ‘tehom’ further reinforces this feeling that things were under judgment while this word is often associated with the sea or deep water it has other shades of meaning as well including the abyss and the grave thus ‘tehom’ is employed in genesis  where it is translated as ‘the great waters’ of noah’s flood and in psalm  as a ‘a great deep’ associated with the god’s judgment the deep does refer to the ocean but it also is symbolic of a judgment against wrongdoing and bolsters the overall feel that things are not right in creation as the opening passage of genesis suggests genesis  “and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day” the ‘let there be light’ phrase does not appear to be a creative act when one studies the hebrew words and their usage here most likely the universe of stars sun and moon were created during the ‘in the beginning’ period but not visible on the earth due to the darkness that apparently enveloped it this also explains why the earth could be in existence during a long span of time without there being days and nights on the surface for some reason a thick cloud cover or water canopy perhaps daylight didn’t reach the surface of the planet this in turn suggests that something evil might very well have changed the planet for the worse only when god was preparing to create man and living organisms on the face of the planet did he make days and nights appear on its surface time didn’t start with the first day on earth but the separation of day and night on the surface of the planet made it possible to tell time as the first days started rolling around marking god’s creation of life on the planet this reading of the past is not disproven by fossil records or the like because it’s not only possible but almost a certainty that prehistoric preadamic life was on earth ‘before’ the genesis  reforming of an earth that had become formless and void if anything fossils buttress this reading of the genesis account with its recreation of the creatures that now inhabit it and the vanishing of the vast hordes of creatures such as the dinosaurs the hebrew story of creation cannot be viewed as an isolated account known only to the ancient jews rather it is a story that has been mimicked and copied by very many other cultures some of which could not have seen the hebrew writings before developing their own versions of the basic story that stories with similar elements sprang up in very different cultures around the world suggests that these stories have a common origin with the biblical account arguably the most accurate due to the unique pains that were taken in keeping the stories true to the original word please note that the scribes copying the various books of the old and new testaments did so with strict supervision and careful checking by the scribe as well as those working with him to avoid errors where many cultures rewarded the embellishment of stories the jewish writers worked in the opposite direction the stories were never to be altered even by punctuation so we know that when lucifer was introduced in the garden of eden he was already in the form of a serpent in this case we can assume that whatever it was that caused the earth to go ‘without form and void’ was linked to what i would consider ‘the first rebellion’  timothy  “in the latter times some shall depart the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils” deuteronomy  “they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not” revelation  “and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him” matthew  “then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels” dr ide thomas “it seems clear to me that the ‘sons of god’ are none other than fallen angels and because of their further sin of lusting after the ‘daughters of men’ many were imprisoned by god both the near annihilation of the human race and the incarceration of the fallen angels in tartarus indicate the magnitude of the sin they committed by such drastic judgment god saved the human race from a calamity worse than the physical death originally imposed upon them” the term ‘sons of god’ in the bible is limited to three categories angels adam and the believers in christ so there are only two ways to become a son of god one way is by being a direct creation of god and the other way is by receiving christ if the devil has angels and they are cast into the lake of fire then they cannot be good angels thus they are fallen angels the biblical evidence is conclusive that the nephilim were in fact men of extraordinary stature and that they descended from human mothers and fallen angel fathers the mingling of these two orders of being was contrary to what god had intended and summarily led to god’s greatest act of judgment ever enacted upon the human race god’s law of reproduction according the biblical account of creation is ‘everything after his kind’ god’s law makes it impossible for giants to be produced by normal parentage to produce such monstrosities as the nephilim presupposes supernatural parentage when one deals with the world of the supernatural rationality is never an argument if there were fallen angelhuman nephilim hybrids in the days of noah and afterward then what will there be at the time of jesus’ return apostle paul says that we have become a new creation in christ as new creations we are adopted by god becoming ‘sons of god’ the down payment of the holy spirit is evidence that we are new creations and are now waiting for the full package when we get to heaven therefore the holy spirit must have indwelt adam prior to his fall because he was classified as a son of god we are sons of god because we are direct creations of god we share that feature with the angels whom we shall be like in heaven however god did not form them from the earth nor did he breathe his own life into the angels and so we possess something that sets us apart from them as far as being sons of god is concerned the work of the cross was the correction of what had been lost four thousand years before the spirit was breathed into adam the first earthly son of god he lost it and now the spirit dwells in the sons of god who we have become by believing in jesus’ name the spirit is the guarantee or down payment for what is about to come upon the earth john  “but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name”  corinthians  “therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation” galatians  “for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything but a new creation” another hint of the relationship between angels and women is given by paul in his letter to corinth here the apostle tells women that they should cover their heads as a sign of subjection to their husbands – and also ‘because of the angels’ paul apparently believed that a woman’s uncovered head was tempting to angels as well as men not surprisingly jewish tradition maintains that it was the beauty of women’s long hair that attracted and tempted the angels to sin in the genesis  account editor’s note or was it because of the energy coming from the crown chakra all we know is that women who are being attacked by incubus spirits have had the experiences stop when they wear a head covering to bed francis a schaefer “more and more we are finding that mythology in general though greatly contorted very often has some historic base and the interesting thing is that one myth which occurs over and over again in many parts of the world is that somewhere a long time ago supernatural beings had sexual intercourse with natural women and produced a special breed of people” the basic message of the apocryphal documents and the various mythologies find corroboration in god’s word spiritbeings from ‘outer space’ did arrive on earth and did produce these unnatural offspring known as the nephilim by this crossbreading man became more and more absorbed with evil and violence the human race became tainted and corrupted and soon the earth was unsalvageable these creatures by means of genetic manipulation had succeeded in contaminating god’s special creation so much so that their destruction as well as that of man became a moral necessity the famous ancient astronaut theorist erick von daniken has supplied us with a wealth of samples from around the world the ancient sumerian records tell of gods descending from the stars and fertilizing their ancestors this interbreeding of gods from heaven and women from earth is supposed to have produced the first men upon the earth the koreans believed that a heavenly king sent his son to earth and married an earth woman who gave birth to tangun waggom it was he who was supposed to have welded all the primitive tribes together into one kingdom from india came the mahabharata and other ancient sanskrit texts which tell of gods begetting children with women on earth and how these children inherited the supernatural skills and teachings of their fathers a similar mythology is found in the epic of gilgamesh where we read of watchers from outer space coming to planet earth and producing giants also an early persian myth tells that before the coming of zoroaster demons had corrupted the earth and allied themselves with women the recurring theme is that ‘gods’ came from the sky and dwelt in various places creating advances in the cultures in which they chose to live bolstering this idea is the fact that the figures carved into the earth appear to be related to the constellations in the sky another source of information is the abundance of myths legends and folklore and fables that speak of giants upon the earth in ancient times and how there was sexual union between demigods from heaven and women from earth many scholars believe that myths emerged from a kernel of historical fact according to andrew thomas mythology and folklore are “thoughtfossils depicting the story of vanished cultures in symbols and allegories” david flynn told us before his untimely passing that “through time and the change of culture the symbols of the mysteries have endured incorporated into the dogma of…philosophies and religions” the whole story of greek mythology is an expanded version of that astonishing verse in the bible ‘that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose’ later of course many of these myths and legends developed an overgrowth of fictional imagery and imaginative fantasy which clung to them like moss to the mill there can be little doubt however that beneath this dense overgrowth lies the plant of truth what began as factual historic documentation has ended up as a longlost legend waiting to be rediscovered at the appointed time when the lord would raise his watchman in the final hour to warn those with eyes who will see and ears who will hear man will not face the judgment alone but we will be joined by the angels that rebelled against god lucifer thought he actually had a chance of winning against god some people say ‘it is better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven’ but only the uninformed say that lucifer does not reign in hell he is tossed into hell after he is judged hell is not going to be a party or mere separation from god it will be complete and righteous judgment for those that want nothing to do with god god has never and will never force anyone to love him therefore hell and judgment are necessary in order to give people what they truly desire those that truly want to be with god will inherit the kingdom of heaven and those that do not will inherit the judgment of hell unfortunately for those who choose to believe a lie ignorance will not be bliss  corinthians  “when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as
