laws due to its colonial past after the  geneva conference vietnam separated into two zones the north and the south in  after the north took control of the south the country adopted a centrallyplanned economy with officials discouraging private commerce history of vietnam corporate law doi moi postedit in  the government initiated economic reforms doi moi to the corporate sector to reinvigorate the ailing economy these policies aimed to reverse most of policies that led to economic crises in the s and s following the vietnam war development of the private sector was encouraged and the economy was liberalized in hopes of increasing the potential for economic development in  the law on foreign investment was passed allowing foreign investors into the country in  the law on private enterprises and companies law were introduced to boost economic development they were subsequently superseded by the law on enterprises loe in  which introduced partnerships in addition to limited liability companies and shareholding companies within three years of implementing the loe over  enterprises were registered as compared to just over  for the previous nine years law on investment replacing law on foreign investment and a new loe were enacted in  these statutes are expected to further strengthen vietnams economy and its potential for international economic integration main sources of law in vietnamedit the constitution  mainly seen as the ultimate party policy documents   different versions     legislation  originated from civil law passed down from the french forms of business enterpriseedit the loe governs business enterprises in vietnam enterprises in all economic sectors have to satisfy the stipulated conditions accounted for in article  there are  forms of business enterprises limited liability company llcedit structure of limited liability companies an llc is established by members capital contribution to the company as a llc is a legal entity separate from the owners the ownerss liability for the firms debts and obligations is limited to his capital contribution llcs exist in two forms  onemember llc or multimember llc the former is owned by an organisationindividual while the latter allows for two to fifty members the management structure consists of a members council mc chairperson of the mc and director where there are more than  members in llc an inspection committee ic must also be established shareholding company scedit structure of a shareholding company an sc is an entity with at least three shareholders where ownership of the firm depends on the number of shares they hold it is the only form of enterprise that can issue securities to raise capital shareholders liability is limited to their capital contribution however shareholders can be personally liable where the company is substantially undercapitalised on formation the management structure consists of a shareholders meeting sm a board of management bom a director and an ic partnershipedit a partnership comprises at least two coowners jointly conducting business under one common name with at least one coowner being an individual in a partnership there can be both limited and unlimited liability partners the partners council consisting of all partners is the highest body in the partnership with the right to resolve all business affairs such as the admission of new partners private enterprisesedit a private enterprise is a firm owned by an individual who is its legal representative the owner has total discretion in making business decisions and is liable for its operations to the extent of all his assets each individual can only establish one private enterprise rules concerning ownership of businessesedit the government has rules to restrict certain lines of businesses and will periodically review business conditions and proceed with any changes accordingly the rights and obligations of business enterprises are provided for in articles – but might differ slightly should the enterprise offer public services or products ownership differences limited liability company llcedit owners in llcs have to contribute capital in full and on time in onemember llcs the owner will be responsible for debts and other property obligations if he fails to do so meanwhile in multimember llcs members are to contribute capital in the type of asset and any change is subject to the consent of other members owners in llcs can assign a share of their capital contribution except where prohibited in onemember llcs this is the only way for the owner to withdraw capital shareholding company scedit the government provides specific provisions on the forms of offering securities to the public in offering securities scs are subject to conditions laid out in the securities law such as the requirement for a paidup charter capital at the time of offering of at least vnd  billion in book value founding shareholders can assign their registered ordinary shares to each other if they hold  of ordinary shares for  years from the date of the business registration certificate approval at the sm will allow a nonfounding shareholder to purchase registered ordinary shares from a founding shareholder partnershipsedit if an unlimitedliability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly other partners may be held liable to compensate the partnership for the damage however where the limited liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly the unpaid amount will become a debt owed by that partner to the partnership an unlimited liability partner can transfer his share of capital in the partnership to another person only with the consent of the other unlimited liability partners private enterprisesedit the owner must register his investment capital in the firm and record changes in the investment capital in the accounts rules concerning corporate governanceedit regulation of governing bodiesedit ownershipedit the ownership powers of the enterprises are vested in the mcchairman for llcs and in the sm and bom for scs they are the highest decision making bodies for each enterprise and are tasked with the passing of resolutions amending the company charter and setting out the general direction of the company etc a resolution can only be passed with a minimum percentage approval such a rule is put in place to ensure the interests of all shareholders are protected executiveedit the director appointed by the ownership institutions of the enterprise has executive powers and oversees the daytoday running of the company for scs and llcs he is legally responsible for the implementation of delegated rights and obligations directors of llcs cannot be affiliated to any member of the mc ensuring the separation of powers between the companys ownership and management however for scs the loe permits persons to take up dual roles as director and chairman of the bom one survey found that  of chairmen of a bom were also the directors of their company furthermore other members of the bom are often majority shareholders and managers of the company this highlights an indefinite differentiation between ownership and management inspectionedit the loe prescribes the formation of a mandatory ic to monitor and check the ownership and executive powers members of the ic must minimally possess professional qualifications or accountingauditing work experience and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies this ensures impartiality and prevents conflict of interests however in scs while members of the ic cannot hold any managerial positions in the company they are allowed to own company shares or be a general employee of the company individual liability for corporate actionsedit ownership representativesedit where the mcchairman of the llc fails to convene a requested meeting within  days of the request he must bear personal liability for any damage that may result to the company executiveedit the loe prescribes that the director of a llc may be sued by shareholders should he fail to perform his obligations and duties in contrast in a sc there are no such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against directors who do not perform their duties while the law lays out the fiduciary duties of the directors it does not provide a way to enforce these duties this has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of scs are not adequately protected inspectorsedit the ic is legally responsible for the implementation of its rights and duties the loe however does not specify the circumstances under which the ic will be deemed to have neglected its rights and duties and hence be legally liable restrictions on transactions with ownersshareholdersedit the loe prescribes certain regulations to control and approve large relatedparty transactions for scs if a loan agreementcontract is valued at at least  of the companys total assets it is subject to approval by the bom all relatedparty transactions must be approved by the shareholders relatedparty include managers of the enterprise or family members of shareholders and relatedparty transactions are business arrangements between two parties with prior relationships management personnel have to disclose details of their and their related parties ownership interests in other enterprises the latter applies where the relatedparty holds more than  of charter capital these measures ensure that personal interests do not override the companys interests in addition shareholders or directors related to the transaction cannot vote on the deal the loe however does not provide for an external checking mechanism for relatedparty transactions the bom has the sole and unfettered right to give approval to relatedparty transactions and this lack of an extra checking mechanism has resulted in a lack of investor protection in vietnamnote  foreign investmentedit both foreign and domestic investments are similarly treated under the loi foreign investors and expatriates working for foreigninvested businesses or business cooperation contract can remit investment capital profits and other assets and their income abroad respectively there are four types of foreign investment in vietnam  foreign owned enterprise foe jointventure enterprise jv business cooperation contract bcc and building–operation–transferbuilding– transfer–operationbuilding–transfer botbtobt foreign owned enterpriseedit foreign investors may establish economic organizations or llcs in the form of  capital of foreign investors joint ventureedit foreign investors may enter a joint venture where there is at least one foreign and one domestic investor the operational duration of a foreign invested project cannot exceed  years where the government thinks it necessary to continue it cannot exceed  years foes are recommended over joint ventures and they can be formed quickly through application of investment licenses joint ventures face problems such as corruption and the lack of control over the business business cooperation contractedit foreign investors may invest in contractual agreements with vietnamese partners to cooperate on specific business activities this form of investment does not constitute a new legal entity and the investors have unlimited liability for bccs debts bot bto btedit a foreign investor can sign such a contract with a state body to implement projects for expansion and modernization of infrastructure projects in the sectors stipulated by the government analysis and assessment of current rulesedit comparison with other jurisdictionsedit flexibility in choosing corporate governance structuresedit although vietnams corporate law adopted angloamerican legal principles common law jurisdictions like the us grant businesses greater flexibility in choosing corporate governance structures the loe however imposes mandatory internal governance structures this has been criticised for failing to give companies the latitude to adapt their corporate governance structures to suit their needs angloamerican law allows directors to delegate their powers to a subcommittee or another person meanwhile in vietnam subcommittees can be established to assist the bom but the latter cannot delegate its powers to the former the imposition of mandatory corporate governance structures without delegation of powers leads to less flexibility and efficiency comparisons between jurisdictions separation of supervisory and management bodiesedit internal governance structures are important in supervising the company managers in us the supervisory body is often subsumed within the singletiered board of directors whereas in vietnam the ic is an independent body through separation of supervisory and management functions the vietnamese corporate law model at least theoretically ensures that the bom is held to a greater degree of accountability by an independent checking mechanism however there is no hierarchy for the vietnamese ic and bom this contrasts with the german twotiered board model for scs with an aufsichtsrat supervisory board which is hierarchically superior to the vorstand management board because the ic is not recognised as a superior institution it has limited authority over the bom in practice many supervisors are low level employees within the company although institutionally independent the members of the ic are in reality dependent on their employers for their livelihoods and therefore serve as a weak check against mismanagement by the bom or director vesting of executive powersedit in vietnam executive powers are vested solely in the director while in germany executive powers are shared equally amongst members of the vorstand this encourages consensus decisionmaking in german companies as responsibility is shared amongst all members of the vorstand this can be further contrasted with japan where the corporate law does not designate any positions for corporate officers the vietnamese equivalent of director and executive powers are largely retained within the board of directors the vietnamese equivalent of bom problemsedit understanding corporate governance and role of management structuresedit corporate governance in vietnam is seen more as a management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders in particular the loe does not clearly mandate the separation of ownership and management separation of ownership and management promotes accountability by allowing managers to be objectively appraised on the other hand owners who serve as managers will be more likely to pursue their own interests possibly at the expense of the interests of minority shareholders stateowned enterprisesedit following the introduction of loe soes were converted to singleorganisationowned llcs however the state retains many powers and is directly involved in management decisionmaking government officials are thus selected to run companies for political reasons their lack of business expertise and profit motive has led to inefficiency and mismanagement of large stateowned enterprises furthermore since only up to three supervisors can be appointed there is limited monitoring on the company managers in  the stateowned shipbuilding firm vinashin ended in bankruptcy following mismanagement and false reporting of financial statements this reflects the inadequate monitoring and auditing mechanisms for soes investor protectionedit the loe is increasingly recognizing the interests of minority shareholders by introducing new avenues for them to hold the management accountablenote  nonetheless with stringent prerequisites including higher shareholding requirements and the need to show evidence before minority shareholders can call for a shareholders meeting investor protection in vietnam is still limited compared to other jurisdictionsnote  other shortcomings of the loe include limited opportunities for shareholders to request a meeting no imposition of legal responsibilities on board members who approve unfair transactions no shareholders rights to sue those in the corporate governance structure for scs and a shortage of provisions to require disclosure obligations and directors to avoid insolvent trading phuoc  partners is vietnamese law firm vietnamese attorney vietnamese solicitor vietnam company law see alsoedit list of company registers notesedit  in a  world bank research vietnam tallied a score of  in the extent of director liability index a stark contrast to the average score of  attained for east asia and pacific economies  these new measures includes basic rights of shareholders such as attending the general shareholders meeting voting on the basis of one share one vote selecting senior managers and supervisors and having priority in making additional capital
