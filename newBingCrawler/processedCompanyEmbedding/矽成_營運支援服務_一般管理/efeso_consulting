consulting pg product supply is preparing to face the millennium by pursuing with tenacity very ambitious objectives especially with regards to organisational capabilities only in this way the pg group will be able to meet with new and increasingly competitive challenges and reach the business objectives set for the next millenniumtoday our company has adopted a strategy of integrating existing operative system with tpm total productive management our european sector has made use of the pke process kaizen engineer proposed by efeso consulting to train the project leaders responsible for the implementation of this program the aim has been to improve further the effectiveness of the current operative systemsthe pragmatic and concrete methods of teaching and training on the job adopted by the pke training package  largely founded on “learning by doing”  have proved to be very effective for the comprehension of tpm methodologies and the absorption into our company culture in addition they have allowed the creation of expertise at pg which can be used as a point of reference for future training coursesthe examples introduced by efeso consulting all gained by direct experience of consultants in the field clarify and give a new lease of life to tpm efeso has created a consultancy relationship based on a westernised style approach and this has helped us to understand the japanese oriented improvement methods in simple termsfacilitating their understanding and implementationtoday pg has developed a proper internal capacity in terms of “guide books” and leader so to allow the continuation of the development program in supporting expanding improvement naturally with the continued support and help of efeso costs quality and security but why is it so
