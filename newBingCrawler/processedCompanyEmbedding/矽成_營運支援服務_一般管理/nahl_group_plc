shareholders registered on  october  business review nah continues to deliver a strong operational performance with enquiry growth up  in the period with core pi enquiries up  and medical negligence enquiries up  resulting in solicitor income increasing by  these volume increases are pleasing although we have experienced some increase in marketing costs primarily driven by advertising rates and increased online bidding in a competitive marketplace which has resulted in cost per enquiry cpe rising by  nah has gained further market share in the period reflecting the continued strength of our brand and we continue to adapt well to changing consumer behaviours such as an increasing trend towards enquiries driven by social media whilst this type of case can be more challenging to convert into a running case for our panel law firms plfs coping with emerging trends is one of nahs strengths and our conversion rate of clean leads to enquiries remains above  our market continues to evolve and law firms operating in the pi space are adapting to the maturing post laspo marketplace the financial robustness of our plfs is critical to us and we monitor cpe very carefully where appropriate we work closely with firms on case conversion so that the effective cost per running case is optimised within nah we have responded to rising cpe by focusing on lead quality the efficiency of our marketing commitments and by building stronger plf relationships we have continued to enhance the number of key strategic longterm relationships we have within our panel with some of the larger players in the pi market whilst managing carefully our concentration risk we now operate with  plfs of which  deal with core pi or medical negligence cases our nah brand continues to rank as the most trusted and recognised in the pi sector approximately  of enquiries are derived from higher margin nonrta and medical negligence cases which are more valuable to plfs revenue from the sale of products medicals insurance and costs which are related to the various services required by plfs to run a case efficiently decreased by  in the period this decline primarily relates to the ministry of justice led introduction of medco in april  which changes the way medical reports are sourced for soft tissue injuries in lower value rta cases however we are encouraged by the market penetration of our recently launched nonmedical negligence ate product thanks to our continued focus on new products we can offer to our plfs and ability to adapt to changes in the market we expect continuing product revenues to stabilise in the second half of  and return to growth during  turning to fitzalan which provides residential conveyancing lead generation services to law firms and surveyors we have been pleased with the progress since acquiring the business we delivered a  operating margin on revenue of gbpm we expect this contribution to grow in the second half as the leadership changes we introduced at the point of acquisition mature and additional staff resources coupled with new products become established outlook the groups second half trading has commenced well and we expect to see further profits growth at nah we are managing closely the growth in enquiry volume as external marketing costs per enquiry remain higher than previous norms we expect fitzalan to contribute to the groups results at an accelerating rate and we are pleased with the acquisition and the performance of the conveyancing sector as a whole we continue to see and assess potential further complementary acquisitions in both pi and conveyancing and believe the strength of our balance sheet alongside our market leading positions means the group is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities we

action the panel law firm contracts directly with the claimant as well as enquiry origination nah provides its panel law firms with products that serve part of the legal process the two main products are a new ate after the event insurance product launched in april  post laspo and medical assessments nah is paid by our panel law firms the panel law firm carries the risk on profitability and cash on the enquiry and by providers of ancillary products including ate and medical assessments in consideration for the provision of such products and services we are not paid by the claimant nahl has three key competitive advantages i             brand recognition and trust ii            marketing expertise iii           solicitor panel relationships these competitive advantages have been developed over  years the nah brand has been built through more than £ million of marketing investment since  and according to market research ranks as the most recognised most searched for and most trusted personal injury brand in the uk market  the incoming consumer contacts are generated as a result of nah’s advertising and online activity nah does not cold call or cold text we campaigned

  more information is available at wwwnahlgroupplccouk and wwwnationalaccidenthelplinecouk       chairmans statement   i am pleased to report the groups results for the six months ended  june    summary of financial performance   nahl has performed well with revenue from continuing operations of £m up   h £m of which £m relates to fitzalan our residential conveyancing lead generation business acquired in february    revenue growth translates into an increase in underlying operating profit from continuing operations of  up from £m to £m with operating profit up  to £m earnings per share from continuing operations were p up    nahl operates within the personal injury pi sector through national accident helpline nah and in the residential conveyancing sector through fitzalan our model is highly cash generative with a   h  conversion of operating profit from continuing operations into cash   our balance sheet is robust and at the period end we had net cash of £m  h £m after paying cash consideration for fitzalan together with a small infill acquisition called best value conveyancing of £m out of a total acquisition price of £m our balance sheet also shows noninterest bearing liabilities of £m  h £m relating to a legacy prelaspo ate product giving an effective adjusted net debt position of £m  h £m at  june    interim dividend   the board has declared an interim dividend of p per share payable on  october  to ordinary shareholders registered on  october    business review   nah continues to deliver a strong operational performance with enquiry growth up  in the period with core pi enquiries up  and medical negligence enquiries up  resulting in solicitor income increasing by  these volume increases are pleasing although we have experienced some increase in  marketing costs primarily driven by advertising rates and increased online bidding in a competitive marketplace which has resulted in cost per enquiry cpe  rising by    nah has gained further market share in the period reflecting the continued strength of our brand and we continue to adapt well to changing consumer behaviours such as an increasing trend towards enquiries driven by social media whilst this type of case can be more challenging to convert into a running case for our panel law firms plfs coping with emerging trends is one of nahs strengths and our conversion rate of clean leads to enquiries remains above    our market continues to evolve and law firms operating in the pi space are adapting to the maturing post laspo marketplace the financial robustness of our plfs is critical to us and we monitor cpe very carefully where appropriate we work closely with firms on case conversion so that the effective cost per running case is optimised   within nah we have responded to rising cpe by focusing on lead quality the efficiency of our marketing commitments and by building stronger plf relationships we have continued to enhance the number of key strategic longterm relationships we have within our panel with some of the larger players in the pi market whilst managing carefully our concentration risk we now operate with  plfs of which  deal with core pi or medical negligence cases   our nah brand continues to rank as the most trusted and recognised in the pi sector approximately  of enquiries are derived from higher margin nonrta and medical negligence cases which are more valuable to plfs   revenue from the sale of products medicals insurance and costs which are related to the various services required by plfs to run a case efficiently decreased by  in the period this decline primarily relates to the ministry of justice led introduction of medco in april  which changes the way medical reports are sourced for soft tissue injuries in lower value rta cases however we are encouraged by the market penetration of our recently launched nonmedical negligence ate product  thanks to our continued focus on new products we can offer to our plfs and ability to adapt to changes in the market we expect continuing product revenues to stabilise in the second half of  and return to growth during    turning to fitzalan which provides residential conveyancing lead generation services to law firms and surveyors we have been pleased with the progress since acquiring the business we delivered a  operating margin on revenue of £m we expect this contribution to grow in the second half as the leadership changes we introduced at the point of acquisition mature and additional staff resources coupled with new products become established   outlook   the groups second half trading has commenced well and we expect to see further profits growth at nah we are managing closely the growth in enquiry volume as external marketing costs per enquiry remain higher than previous norms   we expect fitzalan to contribute to the groups results at an accelerating rate and we are pleased with the acquisition and the performance of the conveyancing sector as a whole   we continue to see and assess potential further complementary acquisitions in both pi and conveyancing and believe the strength of our balance sheet alongside our market leading positions means the group is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities     we enjoyed a strong first half and for  as a whole we intend to deliver results at least in line with market expectations   steve halbert chairman    september  management report   nahl is a leading uk consumer marketing business focused on the uk legal services market the core brand national accident

in the ordinary shares in the company   history of the group national accident helpline was founded in  by regional law firm toller hales and collcutt llp tollers in order to assist accident victims in seeking compensation and redress for injuries suffered the first years of existence saw a gradual increase in the breadth of advertising with the first national press adverts appearing in  and the first ukwide commercial tv adverts airing in  as more legal firms saw the advantages of pooling resources and marketing their services through this new national brand investment in advertising continued to increase in  the groups call centre became fully operational and in  the access to justice bill was passed creating demand for no win no fee agreements in  the group became wholly independent from tollers through a management buyout backed by the private equity firm ldc  in  the ministry of justice formed the claims management regulatory unit the cmru in order to improve access to justice and promote the interests of consumers by regulating claims management companies and marketing service providers  inflexion another private equity firm invested in the group in  in  the group created the underdog character as an advertising vehicle particularly across digital media to represent how nahls core consumer group feel about claiming against large insurance companies institutions and businesses and the potential for every consumer to access justice and compensation the uks legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act  laspo was enacted on  april  prior to this in  russell atkinson and steve dolton joined the group in order to manage the business through the period of regulatory change and develop the future group strategy the group has been operating its core model in the new regulatory environment for more than a year the groups business nahl is a leading uk consumer marketing business focused on the uk personal injury market advertising through its core brand  national accident helpline  established in  the groups business has grown to an industryleading position as an outsourced marketing services provider with approximately £ million of continuing revenues generated in the financial year ended  december  and ongoing operating profit of approximately £ million the directors believe that taken together the groups national accident helpline brand marketing scale and knowhow and its panel law firm relationships form a significant barrier to entry the groups core business model is based on enquiry origination through direct response marketing connecting claimants who have been injured in nonfault accidents with specialist law firms  research suggests that claimants in the uk personal injury litigation market are often not comfortable contacting lawyers directly  nahl is an informative but sympathetic intermediary between the consumer and the law firm  through the strength and trust generated by the national accident helpline brand and by the groups underdog character created in  nahl attracts over  consumer contacts per annum either via website visits inbound telephone contact or webchat  the group has focused on higher value cases which are mostly not road traffic accidents  these contacts are filtered down using specific criteria by the groups legal service advisers and passed on to its panel law firms based on geographic location or specialism of the case  in  the group generated in excess of  enquiries  once an enquiry has been transferred to a selected panel law firm the panel law firm carries out its own risk assessment to decide whether to proceed with the claim or take no further action the panel law firm contracts directly with the claimants as well as enquiry origination nahl provides its panel law firms with products that serve part of the legal process  the main two products are a new ate insurance product launched in april  post laspo and medical assessments nahl is paid by its panel law firms and by providers of ancillary products including ate and medical assessments in consideration for the provision of such products and services it is not paid by the claimants nahl has three key advantages over its competition brand recognition trust and marketing expertise which have all been built over  years  the national accident helpline brand has been developed through more than £ million of marketing investment since  and according to market research ranks as the most recognised most searched for and most trusted brand in the uk personal injury litigation market the incoming contacts are generated as a result of nahls advertising  nahl does not cold call nor cold text nahl campaigned against nuisance marketing during the passage of the laspo bill through parliament and a number of amendments were tabled which reflected nahls representations in its submissions to parliament on  february   nahl is regulated by the cmru and was audited on  february  after the event insurance in the directors experience consumers consider ate insurance products as complimentary to a nowin nofee service  nahl independently offers a range of products and services that support the panel law firms in providing a service to claimants  since  september  the group has partnered with a leading aa rated insurance company to provide this product prior to the introduction of laspo on  april  ate insurance protected the claimant in the event that the claim was unsuccessful by providing cover against having to pay the defendants legal fees and both parties disbursements  following laspo the claimant is no longer liable to pay defendants costs in an unsuccessful claim however ate insurance is often integral to a no win no fee agreement to cover the claimants own disbursements such as medical reports court fees and barristers fees  in the event of a successful claim claimants may now have to pay the insurance premium to the ate provider at the end of the case otherwise the costs are absorbed by the insurance company brand and marketing nahl is experienced at driving brand awareness and growth in quality customer generation in the uk personal injury market according to research in the uk personal injury market  national accident helpline is the most trusted brand the most searched for brand the number one tv and online spender and has the number one click through rate to its website  the group has invested more than £ million in marketing over the past  years and its marketing spend for the year ended  december  was approximately £ million this was funded entirely out of the groups cash flow since  the groups consumer marketing strategy has focused around the underdog character which has differentiated it from its competitors and enabled effective linkage from its tv advertising to its website  the underdog character has been particularly successful in positioning the brand with consumers  according to adwatch in february  approximately  per cent of people surveyed remembered nahls tv adverts according to research the underdog character sympathises with consumers who in nahls experience are often not comfortable contacting a lawyer directly nahl has considerable experience and knowledge of the advertising market and specifically how to market strategically attracting the types of enquiries that its panel law firms find valuable nahl takes an integrated multichannel approach to marketing with the groups brand being marketed across tv online and social media according to independent tracking nahl is a market leader in terms of attracting online impressions number of appearances in google searches and according to market research has the highest average position in terms of search results and clickthrough rates the directors believe that this marketleading position is primarily due to the strength of the brand combined with the management teams marketing knowhow and search engine bidding strategy growth strategy there are three key segments to the uk personal injury litigation market road traffic accidents rta nonrta and clinical negligence nahl is well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities provided by the two segments of the market that are growing strongly nonrta and clinical negligence approximately  per cent of enquiries generated by nahl for its panel law firms in the financial year to  december  were in these faster growing nonrta and clinical negligence segments the directors estimate that the groups share of total claims registered with the compensation recovery unit in the uk personal injury litigation market for the  months to  march  were as follows  per cent for rta  per cent for nonrta and  per cent for clinical negligence nahl intends to focus on four key platforms for growth   market share development   nahl has a strong position in the higher value growth areas of the uk personal injury market these being nonrta and clinical negligence the directors expect these segments to grow further and by focusing resource on these areas nahl expects to increase its overall market share in addition nahl believes that further consolidation could occur as a result of noncompliant and marginally profitable claims management companies and marketing services providers leaving the industry nahls strong market position makes it ideally placed to benefit from continued consolidation nahl also believes that geographic opportunities exist to increase volume in specific regions for example scotland   profit enhancement   nahl has been developing closer relationships with a smaller number of panel law firms working closely with these panel law firms the group expects to develop a number of initiatives to improve overall profitability initiatives such as electronic direct call transfer and enhanced data capture have been introduced since december  nahl believes that these initiatives could offer improved conversion rates for panel law firms and as such should result in higher case profitability for panel law firms over time in addition nahl expects that panel law firms case profitability analysis should facilitate tailored marketing activity to enable nahl to actively target higher convertible work the directors expect that the result of these initiatives will enable margin growth for nahl as the value of the services it provides improves case profitability for panel law firms   product and brand extension   nahl currently offers postaccident presettlement services and products however nahl is well placed to leverage the strength of its brand by extending into accident management services and other postsettlement support specialisms that should drive further commission revenue nahl is also actively developing a new enhanced medical negligence screening service that is expected to add value to its panel law firms by cutting costs and complexity   process outsourcing opportunities exist for nahl to offer further services to its panel law firms which could enable them to reduce their costs and focus on high value legal activity further growth opportunities   as the market consolidates there are likely to be opportunities to enhance earnings through targeted acquisitions the group has core skills in selling marketing services and in particular pooled marketing services to professional businesses there is therefore the opportunity to expand this core competence by offering such services into other fields of professional activity the directors believe that these strategic opportunities offer nahl excellent growth prospects nahls executive management   russell atkinson aged   chief executive officer russell atkinson joined the group in  mr atkinson previously

administrative and other expenses as well as continually monitoring and controlling the mix of enquiries passed to the panel law firms our overall operating profit margin from continuing items has increased to   h  and we expect to deliver further improvement as enquiry numbers increase   two exceptional oneoff items being the payment of an employee bonus of £ and the crystallisation of a contingent asset of £ both related to the groups admission to aim and will not continue going forward  further details of these amounts are included in note  to this financial statement   discontinued operation   on th may  the group demerged its ppi claimline division and its parent company seebeck  limited via a capital reduction of £m  this resulted in a loss on disposal of £m which along with associated losses in the period to th may  and associated reorganisation costs  fees of £m produced a loss from the discontinued operation of £m  h  profit of £m   earnings per share   basic and

paid on st october  to ordinary shareholders registered at the close of business on rd october   the board intends to pay two thirds of its retained earnings each year as a dividend  of this it is expected that approximately a third will be paid at the interim stage and two thirds at the final stage  the final payment is expected to be announced in march  for payment in april    cash and

net cash   other payables relating to prelaspo ate product     adjusted net debt           the group was able to reduce net debt as a result of its continued good net cash flow performance from operating activities  for continuing products the group generated £m of operating cash flow  h £m which represents  of operating profit excluding prelaspo ate share based payments and oneoff items  h   the group continues to collect its solicitor income by direct debit in the month following invoice and therefore would expect this strong operating cash flow performance to continue  the group would
