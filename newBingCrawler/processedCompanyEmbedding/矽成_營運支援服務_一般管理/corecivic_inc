corecivic inc nysecxw  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»market dynamics part  supply surges and corecivic incjun  about corecivic inc cxw dane bowler value hedge fund analyst reits longshort equitynd market capitalsummarysupply surges can drop a stock price overnightoften the effects are shortlivedwe reveal a current opportunity generated through a supply surgein part  we discussed how supply chokes can cause stocks to get irrationally high and in this installment we will analyze supply surges which can do the opposite presently a supply surge has made core civic nysecxw quite opportunistic supply surges for the purposes of this article i am not referring to fundamental supply for a companys product but rather the supply of the stock itself specifically a supply surge refers to situations in which an abnormally high number of investors are selling for inelastic reasons in other words the sellers are not selling because they believe the price is at or above fundamental value but rather for reasons unrelated to company fundamentals following are  common causes of supply surges window dressing secondary offerings tax loss selling moral imperative window dressing funds often are obliged to reveal their holdings in full or in part at the end of each quarter and those who do not wish to be associated with certain stocks will sell prior to the end of a quarter so as to mollify blame window dressing is a shameful and selfish act as it hurts the clients of the funds which are supposed to be their fiduciary but it is unfortunately fairly common due to window dressing beaten down stocks will often drop even further heading into the closing days of a quarter secondary offerings offerings are perhaps the most obvious source of a supply surge as it is simply the company issuing supplying a number of shares that is often many multiples of daily volume the larger the offering is relative to the stock the greater the pricing impact we have seen this quite clearly in city office reit nysecio as it issued shares in early january  since the issuance is a day deal the dip is often shortlived tax loss selling this supply surge is fairly selfexplanatory as the end of the year approaches investors sitting on losses often sell to capture the tax loss in the current taxable year to wash capital gains they may be sitting on moral imperative investing is not always strictly a financial endeavor many like to feel they are making the world a better place by lending their capital to businesses with a positive impact this can cause green companies or those with socially positive impact to trade up or conversely those that are viewed as polluters or socially harmful to trade down i would argue that this has a semipermanent impact on resting trading multiple with reits associated with good and bad trading at a multiple  to  turns higher and lower respectively the passive impact on multiples is not a supply surge as it is lasting but occasionally the moral imperative will have spikes in intensity this leads us to a current investable opportunity created by a supply surge current opportunity the new york city comptroller scott stringer made a powerful remark regarding private prison reits with donald trump in the white house were seeing more and more industries try to profit from backwards policies at the expense of immigrants and communities of color divesting is simply the right thing to do  financially and morally i have no intent to get into the political angle of this argument and only bring it up to discuss the investment opportunity that resulted on june th the nyc pension funds announced intended divestiture of all shares of corecivic cxw and geo group nysegeo since that time both stocks are down substantially this drop does not even include todays move  in which both were down  intraday we believe the comptrollers statement along with the pension funds actions inspired others across the country to take a moral stand with their investment dollars cxw was already cheap and this supply surge has dropped cxw further below its fundamental value which we estimate at around  it is difficult to discern when the selling wave will end and equilibrium restored but cxw can now be purchased for about  of fundamental value that is quite a discount and there is a well covered  yield to tide investors over while they wait out the storm  price target as seen below cxw is taking quite a hit to its ffoshare in  estimates source snl financial this is the delayed impact of a ruling during the obama administration to phase out the use of private prisons the period of reduced contracts resulted in lower occupancy and therefore lower revenues we anticipate a bounceback going forward as jeff sessions has reversed the ruling with an intent to use private prisons public prisons are dangerously overcrowded and private prisons can house detainees at far cheaper per diem rates thus we foresee the balance of contracts going to private rather than public prisons with cxw being the prime beneficiary as its currently low occupancy is filled ffoshare should rise to about  per share making our target price about a x multiple given that reits trade at midteens multiples on forward ffo our price target still represents a massive discount which more than makes up for the  to  turn passive discount for being a sin stock wrapping it up market dynamics greatly influence shortterm pricing with little to no bearing on fundamental valuation this creates opportunistic mispricing frequently

corecivic inc cxw michael boyd longshort equity contrarian mediumterm horizon midcapmarketplaceindustrial insightssummarytaking a gamble on corecivic previously corrections corporation of america after the collapse of  has proved fruitfulstill the company has not fully recovered from that price drop potentially an area of opportunitygiven the recent rebranding distribution cut negative contract extensions and continued idle properties negatives still aboundwith that said the new distribution should be easily maintained over the next four years given the likely shift in the federal viewpoint on prison populationsfor those investors that were buyers of corecivic nysecxw previously corrections corporation of america during the price collapse in the latter half of  they have been rewarded quite handsomely while i think investors at the time were taking on inordinate risk particularly given the potential longterm ramifications of the department of justice memorandum instructing the federal bureau of prisons to significantly reducecut renewals on private prison operators sometimes taking a gamble pays off with the victory of donald trump and the nomination of jeff sessions for attorney general corecivics future seems so much brighter than it did early on last year  yet the shares are still trading down is there still a little meat left on this bone for investors getting involved now or is the recent distribution cut reason enough to leave this one alone rebranding initiative coincidentally right around the time of the department of justice memorandum corecivic at the time corrections corporation of america decided to undergo a rebranding initiative officially starting the process to change its name the company line on this move was that this was simply a result of a yearslong evolution of the companys structure away from just a corrections and detention management company and into a company that offers a broader suite of product offerings corecivic now has three business lines driven by m in acquisitions over the past several years safety legacy business properties government realestate advisement and community residential reentry for released prisoners of note however is the fact that corecivic management does not report these three business lines on a segment basis and has not announced any plans to do so if management wants investors to buy the story of not being just a private prison operator then the financials and granularity needs to be provided critics of the private prison industry take the polar opposite view of why this name change was done to them this name change is simply a way for the nations largest private prison operator to try to escape a damaged brand that the media has raked over the coals for years remember this change comes after a department of justice report was released that looked at more than a dozen prisons in the industry a report that found incidences of overcrowding misuse of solitary confinement inadequate medical care and overall dangerous conditions at many of the nations largest prisons including corecivic assets is management simply trying to engage in a bit of sleight of hand like most stories the reality is that the real reason is a blend of both while corecivic may be developing itself into a company with a more diversified asset base it will also benefit significantly by being able to distance itself from past negative press certainly in the short term i think the critics might be more right about why the move was done but long term corecivic very well could become a diversified player in the industry this middle ground extends to the companys business model as well im a firm believer in the power of private enterprise and i do think that private prison systems can be run and regulated in a way that creates benefits for taxpayers while at the same time being controlled for issues related to the incentive structure recent developments are a mixed bag… as part of the q earnings release corecivic management announced the contract retention with immigration and customs enforcement at the south texas family residential center this facility was turned operational and an expansion was announced in  to accommodate additional capacity of female illegal immigrants with children family units the initial service agreement was for four years but corecivic agreed to lower fixed monthly payments beginning late in  in order to extend the lease term to five years this secures the cash flows long term but it will reduce revenues at the south texas facility by  along with reducing operating margins once stronger than consolidated results down to average among the companys facilities this will hurt consolidated net income and therefore distributable cash flow going forward why the agreement to lower rates in june of  the government announced policy changes in the duration of detentions for those awaiting processing through immigration courts the united states government continues to be sued over its policies related to detention of migrant families corecivic is apparently willing to lock in less shortterm earnings on a more ironclad contract with a longer term which should hopefully avoid a disastrous outcome where its facilities become orphaned this is a real risk for corecivic the new contract at cibola county notwithstanding if facilities go idle they often sit for quite some time prairie correctional huerfano county and diamondback  beds of capacity have all sat idle since  this isnt an immaterial amount of capacity and these idled facilities have been a primary contributor to why owned and managed facilities have fairly poor occupancy rates  average in  will slide to below  in fiscal  as far as those facilities sitting vacant since  corecivic continues to carry these assets at a fair value of m on its balance sheet despite these properties not generating any revenue in fact generating millions of dollars in expenses related to carrying costs im honestly surprised that management has not taken the steps to write down the carrying value of these assets if they have sat idle this long they are highly unlikely to generate value in the future these arent the only assets sitting idle but are simply the oldest ones corecivic has seven core facilities sitting vacant generating more than m in expenses per quarter along with m in book value that is at risk as can be seen below within the financials the associated expenses are not immaterial to the companys quarterly net income and the fact that correctional facility assets can often be orphaned for years before finding a new contract if at all is a major reason why the selloff in  occurred  and so are the financials broadly corecivic has seen increasing funds from operations since  primarily driven by margin expansion and not top line growth revenue has only grown at a  annual pace since  barely a trickle when you consider the m spent on business acquisitions and m in capital expenditures a large portion of which was expansionary all of that margin expansion has come from very tight control on facility costs gaap depreciation and corporate costs have all well outpaced revenue growth over the past several years critics here would likely point out all the problems corecivic facilities have endured a lot of which come down to accusations of understaffing or underqualified employees driven by uncompetitive pay management would say this is a result of quality management on a facilities level to bring down costs per bed without compromising safety or lowering the quality of treatment of housed individuals in any case i think investors need to have caution going forward and should not expect a repeat of bps of ebitda expansion annually when they are considering corecivic prospects over the next several years particularly when you have issues like the south texas contract restructure that will negatively impact overall margins going forward this plays into  guidance which calls for share in funds from operations ffo representing a significant contraction from what is likely to be share in  seeing  drops in ffo yearyear is never something an investor seeking stability and consistency wants to see and this drop is a major reason why corecivic equity trades at a discount to  levels despite the incremental improvements posted since then that drop in ffo is what drove the cut in the distribution given investors should expect share in funds available for distribution fad given the usual share in maintenance capex and other deductions the prior distribution level would have had to be funded partially through debt and would give the company no ability to retain cash flow for expansionary activity i dont think investors should be upset by the cut in this case given its necessity given expectations that strong financial management carries over to how corecivic treats its balance sheet the company has no debt maturities until  and has a touch more than m in available liquidity via cashonhand and under its revolving credit facility leverage remains light net debtebitda of x and interest coverage is firm in the short term there is little risk but investors do need to be aware that lease terms are rather short  years which is particularly bothersome given the near impossibility in finding alternative tenants for these facilities corecivic can ill afford to see more of its facilities idled investor takeaway while the new  yield going forward should be relatively stable there are risks of further weakness while the next four years will almost assuredly not be a period characterized by the federal government incentivizing cuts in prison populations there is no guarantee that the future is as concrete i think that feeling is palpable by management given the lack of expansion or new facility starts heading into fiscal  with little expansion planned there is not much reason to assume any meaningful growth to take place  expect the distribution to stay where it is management focus will likely shift to getting someone  anyone  into idled facilities as a means of driving financial improvement i dont see the screaming deal here that many still see but instead see investors being close to fairly compensated for the risk they are taking on for deep dive
