pure speculation play that i am guessing will be either a  loss or a  gain over the next year but after investigating i personally like what i am finding i found it by accident when searching for information on another stock the product immediately caught my attention but i have been burned by story stocks before they sound good but never make money so i searched several message boards for stock hype but i did not find any with activity i have been impressed so far with the company and the people involved it is still an otc penny stock so you must also consider the risk of stock manipulation no matter how good the company is the stock just did a private placement of  million with an offshore company but according to the press release it was for a fixed amount   cents per share with incentive warrants  per share available in the future so no convertible debenture to worry about the ceo and a director also agreed not to sell any of their shares until may st  now here is my personal quick assessment acro inc ticker acri otcbb is very thinly traded not much daily volume but the largest shareholder ehud keinan see short bio below who owns  appears to be a straight shooter with good connections on his advisory board like general ret ehud arak former idf chief of staff and former primer minister of israel and the product has recently tested well and appears to be in the right place at the right time to do very well if they can market it properly with the right price point and produce a quality product that customers are pleased with searching for company news can be tricky because they were listed in the oil services sector until  under the ticker mdin when the company made a complete change in direction and a new board of directors but they are still listed in the oil sector on most stock quotes plus many stock websites include news info for a different company called acacia which apparently used acri or acro a couple years ago yahoo is one of the few quote services that seem to have the news and quote info correct httpfinanceyahoocomqsacriob please do your own research and consider the high risks before investing monty below are some informational excerpts i found that will get you started on your research  about acro inc httpwwwacroseccom acro inc is involved in the development of explosives detection technologies the company developed a unique patented technology for identifying peroxide based explosives such as tatp acros advisory board includes general ret ehud barak former idf chief of staff and former primer minister of israel prof k barry sharpless winner of the  nobel prize for chemistry and prof richard a lerner president  ceo of the scripps research institute which is considered one of the most influential scientific institutes worldwide  acro reports on independent testing of peroxide explosive tester  pet by rafael israels national defense research and development defense laboratory to provide third party verification of proprietary technology tel aviv israelbusiness wirejanuary   acro inc otc bbacri today announced that rafael israels armament development authority and a world leader in the development and production of advanced interdisciplinary weapon systems for naval air and ground forces is testing the companys proprietary peroxide explosive tester  the acropet internationally renowned rafael has been contracted to independently establish the product parameters in few specific areas selectivity tests to eliminate falsepositive detections performance in the presence of camouflaging materials determination of threshold levels of detection and the mechanical reliability of the product initial tests on  units of the device have demonstrated that the acropet can detect less than  micrograms  gram of tatp furthermore  different commonly used and commercially purchased materials were tested to verify that they do not provide falsepositive results the results were better than pretest expectations and have been published in a report this invaluable report will be made available to potential customers to clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the acropet acro intends to deliver the device to several international security agencies for further evaluation tests the receiving agencies are all governmental national security agencies such as the us department of homeland security several national police forces have also requested to receive evaluation units independent verification of the acropet product and its potential to address the threat of improvised explosives by rafael is of great assistance in propelling the company from development to fullfledged marketing acro is the only company using this technology which addresses the multitude of threats arising from peroxide based explosives which may appear in variety of shapes and form including liquid explosives stated gadi aner chairman of the board tel aviv israel november  prnewswirefirstcall  acro inc otcbb acri announces that it has completed the first production of its patented peroxide based explosives tester the acropet this device is one of the few products in the market that is able to identify the peroxide based explosives such as the tatp and is the only one using acros proprietary technology acro intends to deliver these products to several international security agencies for evaluation tests the receiving agencies are all governmental national security agencies such as the us department of homeland security several national police forces have also requested to receive evaluation units prof ehud keinan the inventor a director and scientific advisor to acro stated that acros goal is to ensure that its product meets all the standards and function as intended thus allowing us to finally be able to provide a viable method of combating the terrible threat of terror with improvised explosives such explosives which can appear in many different forms and shapes including liquids are very difficult to detect acropet is the only product available using this technology for identifying peroxide based explosives  arco inc product our first product called the peroxide explosives tester acropet acropet is a small disposable pen like probe which detects the presence of peroxidebased explosives using three chemical solutions and relies on direct contact with the suspicious substance acropet has been designed for rapid onsite detection of peroxidebased explosives its main advantages are high sensitivity high selectivity fast response simple operation small size and cost effectiveness in november  we completed the first production of the acropet for evaluation by potential customers we intend to deliver these products to several international security agencies for evaluation tests to date the data supporting our development programs is derived solely from laboratory and limited early stage trials that were not all designed to be statistically significant or proofofconcept trial some of which are exploratory in nature we cannot assure you that our acropet will gain commercial acceptance in the marketplace we plan to follow acropet with additional future products utilizing our proprietary technologies and public domain methods for detecting other explosives  formerly known as medina international corp otcbb mdin until  acro inc otc acri industry oil equipment  services older info from answerscom acro inc was incorporated in the state of nevada on may   since the companys inception its business has been to provide professional consulting services for the technical and economic evaluation of petroleum and natural gas resources the primary services that the company offered was conducting due diligence on petroleum and natural gas projects identifying potential petroleum and natural gas projects available for acquisition by clients and the provision of professional services to petroleum and natural gas clients primarily in the technical areas of geology geophysics and petroleum engineering acro was not successful in fully implementing its initial business plan for the consulting services and have decided to no longer offer consulting services to oil and gas companies to better protect stockholder interests and provide future appreciation management have conducted an indepth analysis of its business and decided to find a product that the company would be able to develop and license or sell the product that it has found is a method of detecting peroxide based explosives when the company completes its acquisition of us patent no  and the related intellectual property for its potential explosive detection device products the company would be competing with other developers and manufacturers of explosive detection device several corporate announcements have recently appeared in the media about efforts to develop devices that detect triacetone triperoxide most of these devices are based on airsampling followed by spectral analysis using various methods these instruments which are quite heavy and expensive are designed primarily for checkpoint stations such as airports nevertheless none of them can compete with the companys potential peroxide based explosive detection device which is a small disposable device portable easy to operate for quick analysis by anybody at any location the company plans to introduce its potential products to the addressable markets such as the law enforcement agencies military airport security personnel and others employed in security checkpoints at other locations vulnerable to terrorist attacks acro inc does not currently have any employees  professor ehud keinan before joining acro inc benno gitter and ilana ben ami
