referred to as issuer direct the company we or our unless otherwise noted we are a delaware corporation formed in october  under the name docucon incorporated in december  we changed our name to issuer direct corporation our corporate offices are located at  perimeter park drive suite d morrisville north carolina  issuer direct is an industryleading communications and compliance company focusing on the needs of corporate issuers issuer directs principal platform platform idtm empowers users by thoughtfully integrating the most relevant tools technologies and services thus eliminating the complexity associated with producing and distributing financial and business communications we work with a diverse client base in the financial services industry including brokerage firms banks and mutual funds we also sell products and services to corporate issuers professional firms such as investor relations and public relations and the accounting and the legal communities corporate issuers and their constituents utilize our cloudbased platforms and related services from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies platforms and shareholders in the past we have reported our revenues in three different streams we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website securities and exchange commission sec filings investor events news and earnings releases public conference calls webcasts and social media we use these channels to communicate with our investors and the public about our company our products and services and other issues it is possible that information we post on some of these channels could be deemed to be material information therefore we encourage investors the media and others interested in our company to review the information we post to all of our channels including our social media accounts platform and technology as the company continues its transition to a cloudbased subscription business we expect the platform and technology portion of our business to continue to expand over the next several years and become the majority of the companys revenues leading this transition are the technology offerings from our accesswire news business and our core historical tools for disclosure management and shareholder communications additionally our product road map includes planned advancements in both our current platformid offering as well as additional offerings in which we see long term opportunity these advancements will leverage our current application technology framework and give us an opportunity to further expand our customer and user base platform id platform id is a cloudbased subscription platform that efficiently and effectively manages the events of a company that seeks to distribute its messaging to key constituents investors markets and regulatory systems around the globe currently platform id consists of nine related but distinct shareholder communications and disclosure reporting modules part of these capabilities were historically part of our disclosure management and shareholder communications offerings but are now included into our fully integrated platform within most of our target markets customers require several individual services or software providers to meet their investor relations communications and compliance needs we believe platform id breaks down those barriers and combines all those needs into a single signon platform  one that offers a company control increases efficiencies demonstrates a clear roi and most importantly delivers consistent and compliant messaging from one centralized platform while the complete platform is available for a single subscription fee companies also have the flexibility to choose one or more of the specific modules that fit their needs based on the stage of the companys development set forth below are the nine modules currently included in platform id accesswiretm our press release platform is a costeffective fd fair disclosure news dissemination and media outreach service the accesswire business focuses on press release distribution for both private and publicly held companies globally accesswire is fast becoming a competitive alternative to the traditionally major newswires because we have been able to expand upon our distribution with key partners increase our analytics reporting and maintain the simple flat rate licensing and per release options as a result we anticipate we will continue to add new clients throughout  and beyond we will continue to brand our press release offerings under the name accesswire which we believe will solidify our market position in the newswire business accesswire is dependent upon several key partners for news distribution some of which are also partners that we rely on for other investor outreach offerings a disruption in any of these partnerships could have a materially adverse impact on our business classifytm classify is our buyside sellside and media targeting database and intelligence analytics platform that customers can add on to their platform id subscription this subscriptionbased platform is centered around both our shareholder communications and news distribution offerings we hope the classify analytics and peer review application will become the focal point for our platform id dashboard as customers become increasingly interested in peer performance and realtime alerts to vital data points throughout the day to ensure the adoption of this subscription feature we have begun providing select clients with this dashboard on a trial basis and intend to broaden this offering to all customers this fiscal year we believe our dataset will be an attractive option for both investor relations and public relations firms and for customers looking for an alternative to current products in the market based on price and flexibility as well as data quality and quantity further to our strategy the classify dataset will be fully integrated into our accesswire offering this year as a way to expand distribution via highly focused targeted lists of professionals from our dataset we expect this to further drive revenues per release as well as subscriptions over the year investor networktm over the past year we have been focused on refining the model of digital distribution of our customers message to the investment community this has been accomplished by integrating investor networks analytics into and with our classify dashboard most of the customers subscribing to this platform today are historical precision ir pir  annual report service ars users we have migrated many of those customers from the traditional ars business into this new digital subscription business however there can be no assurances these customers will continue long term using this digital platform if market conditions for shareholder interest is not present earnings events there are over  companies in north america conducting earnings events each quarter that include teleconference webcast or both as part of their events along with webcasting and teleconference our platform incorporates each element of the earnings event including earnings announcement earnings press release and sec form k filings there are a handful of our competitors that can offer this today however we believe our realtime event setup and integrated approach offers a more effective way to manage the process as well as attract an audience of investors in the teleconference and webcasting space we spent time in the latter part of  developing and integrating systems and processes with our platform and partners the earnings event business is a highly competitive space with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in the investor and communications firms toward the end of  we created an application protocol interface api for the webcast marketplace and will begin partnering with publishers and other platforms to license our datasets which we believe will further increase our brand awareness this api license will allow publishers to query single or multiple companies current and past earnings calls and present those webcasts on their platforms additionally as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform all events will be broadcast live on our investor network platform which will drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event we believe these competitive advantages will increase the demand for our webcasting platform among the corporate issuer community investor relations ir websites  data feeds inside of platform id is our investor relations content network which is used to create the ir tab of a public companys website this investor relations content network is a robust market data cloud of news stock fundamentals regulatory filings corporate governance hotlines and many other components that are aggregated from a majority of the major exchanges and news distribution outlets around the world these data feeds are licensed individually and as a complete platform to preipo reporting companies and partners seeking to display our content on their platforms the clear benefits to our ir platform is its integration into and with the entire cloudbased system meaning companies can produce content for public distribution and it is automatically linked to their corporate site distributed to targeted groups and placed into and with our data feed partners whistleblower hotline our whistleblower platform is an addon product within platform id this system delivers secure notifications and basic incident workflow management processes that align with a companys corporate governance whistleblower policy as a supported and subsidy bundle product of the new york stock exchange nyse offerings it is our hope we will gain relationship with new ipo clients and other larger cap clients listed on the nyse blueprinttm blueprint is our cloudbased document conversion editing and filing platform that was designed for reporting companies and professionals seeking to insource the document drafting editing and filing processes to the sec and sedar system for electronic document analysis and retrieval which is the canadian equivalent of edgar blueprint is available in both a secure public cloud with the companys platformid subscription as well as in a private cloud for corporations mutual funds and the legal community looking to further enhance their internal document process our belief is that once fully developed and marketed we will see a negative impact on our legacy disclosure conversion services business in the future however the margins associated with our subscription business compared to our services business are higher and align with our longterm strategy and as such we hope blueprint will have a positive impact on our net income in the future stock transfer a valued subscription in our platformid ecosystem is the ability for our customers to gain access to realtime information of their shareholders stock ledgers reports and issue new shares from our cloudbased platform managing the capitalization table of a public company or preipo company is the cornerstone of corporate governance and transparency and as such companies bond offerings and community banks have chosen our transfer agent subsidiary direct transfer llc to assist with their stock transfer needs this is an industry which has experienced declining revenues as it was affected by the convergence of paper certificates to digital form however we have recently been focused on licensing opportunities of our stock transfer platform allowing customers to gain access to our cloudbased system in order to move shares or query shareholders which has significantly changed the long term dynamics for both our customers and us during the fourth quarter of  we completed a strategic upgrade to our platform that reaches private companies seeking to raise capital under regulation a and regulation d this cloudbased system was released during the first quarter of  under the brand transferly transferly is a subscription platform that gives companies and broker dealers the ability to assist in the process of identifying managing and completing the investment process of an offering once an offering is completed companies can utilize our stock transfer system to continue the communication and compliance issuance work a company is required to manage proxy  annual general meeting agm our proxy business is marketed as a fully integrated realtime voting platform for our customers and their shareholders of record this platform is utilized for every annual meeting and or special meeting we manage for our client base and offers both fullset mailing and notice of internet availability options services as the company focuses on expanding its cloudbased subscription business we expect to see a decrease in the overall revenues associated with our services business typically services revenues relate to where resources are required to perform the work for our clients and or hard goods are utilized as part of the engagement to date most of our services have been related to converting and editing sec documents and xbrl tagging which has been our core disclosure business over the last  years services also include telecommunications services and print fulfillment and delivery of stock certificates proxy materials or annual reports depending on each customers engagement services are not required but are optional for customers that utilize our platform id our investor outreach and engagement offering formerly known as the ars now known as the investor network was acquired from pir the ars business has existed for over  years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses globally for tens of thousands of customers we continue to operate a portion of this legacy system and continue to migrate the install base over to our subscriptions business of investor network which is our digital platform and outreach engagement dataset portions of this legacy system are still operational specifically for those who opt to take advantage of physical delivery of material we believe we will continue to see further attrition of both customers and revenues in this category as we focus our efforts on our digital platforms and subscription business

decreased  compared to the same period in the prior year platform and technology revenue increased  or  to  during the threemonth period ended march   as compared to  during the same period of  a majority of the increase is due to the continued success of our accesswire news distribution platform which increased  during the threemonth period ended march   as compared to the same period of the prior year the increase is attributable to our investment in increased sales staff and distribution during the latter part of  as the company was able to continue to penetrate the newswire market additionally we earned increased revenue from the same period of the prior year from other platforms including our blueprint whistleblower webcasting classify stock transfer ir website and data feeds and proxy platforms these increases were offset by a decline in revenue from our investor network platform services revenue decreased  or  to  during the threemonth period ended march   as compared to  during the same period of  the decrease is primarily associated with a decrease in revenue from our ars services due in part to a benefit recorded during the threemonth period ended march   related to the reversal of the accrual for unused postage credits noted earlier as well as continued client attrition as customers elect to leave the service or transition to digital fulfillment additionally we experienced a decline in revenue from our print and proxy distribution services as well as stock transfer services which are project based services and dependent on the timing of our customers and corporate directives a portion of the projects performed in the prior year were onetime projects and certain projects that we anticipated performing in the three month period ended march   were delayed to the second quarter we also experienced a decline in our traditional edgar and xbrl services due to continued pricing pressure in those markets no customers accounted for more than  of the operating revenues during the threemonth periods ended march   or  revenue backlog at march   we have recorded deferred revenue of  that we expect to recognize over the next twelve months compared to  at december   deferred revenue primarily consists of advance billings for annual contracts for legacy ars services and licenses of our cloudbased platforms cost of revenues and gross margin cost of

gross margins from platform and technology was  in the threemonth period ended march   as compared to  in the same period of  the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to increased

professional services general corporate expenses and facility and equipment expenses general and administrative expenses increased  or  during the threemonth period ended march   as compared to the

capitalized  and  respectively of software development costs depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses during the threemonth period ended march   decreased by  or  as compared to the same period of  the decrease is due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the pir acquisition that became fully amortized during the year ended december   other income expense other income expense for the threemonth period ended march   is primarily the result of the change in fair value of stock received in lieu of cash to settle an outstanding receivable income tax expense we recognized income tax expense of  and  for the threemonth periods ended march   and  respectively at the end of each interim period we estimate the effective tax rate we expect to be applicable for the full fiscal year and this rate is applied to our results for the yeartodate period and then adjusted for any discrete period items for the threemonth period ended march   the variance between the companys effective tax rate and the us statutory rate of  is primarily attributable to the excess stockbased compensation tax benefit of  recognized in income tax expense during the period in connection with the companys adoption of asu  as well as foreign statutory tax rate differentials and tax credits during the threemonth period ended march   the company released  of its valuation allowance related to federal and state net operating losses which resulted in a net benefit of  this along with foreign statutory tax rate differentials and tax credits is the reason for the variance from the us statutory rate for the threemonths ended march   net income net income for the threemonth period ended march   was  compared to  for the same period of  as noted earlier included in net income for the threemonth period ended march   is the benefit of  before taxes related to the reversal of an accrual related to unused postage credits related to ars clients acquired from pir notwithstanding the benefit of this reversal the company was able to maintain gross margin percentage on slightly lower revenue liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and  in net accounts receivable current liabilities at march   totaled  including our accounts payable deferred revenue accrued liabilities income taxes payable and other accrued expenses at march   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by  effective september   the company renewed its line of credit which reduced the interest rate to libor plus  from libor plus  the amount of funds available for future borrowings remained at  as of march   the interest rate was  and the company did not owe any amounts on the line of credit we manage our cash flow carefully with the intent to meet our obligations from cash generated from operations however it is possible that we will have to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity in order to meet any future obligations there can be no assurance that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses to allow us to pay dividends or meet our other obligations and there is no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available or if available that such financing will be upon terms acceptable to us  outlook    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all
