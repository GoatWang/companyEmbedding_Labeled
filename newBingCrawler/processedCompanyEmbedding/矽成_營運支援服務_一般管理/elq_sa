engineering news and insight directly from those who build and package mysql products debian  and mysql watch out june  linux packaging repos upgradingyngve svendsen debian logo by software in the public interest inc ccbysa mysql and debian  “stretch” debian  “stretch” was released on june  and we congratulate the debian community on another iteration of a central linux distro now the debian release team some time ago decided not to ship mysql as part of the distro instead replacing it with one of the downstream forks the mysql team is absolutely committed to making sure that the vast mysql user base can continue to use debian as a platform and we are directing a lot of attention to making sure that mysql works well on debian and that our debian packages and online repos provide everything a debian user expects in short mysql as a product is advancing rapidly and so will the experience of using mysql on debian a somewhat unexpected late change in debian  may cause those mysql users who upgrade directly from debian  to  to have their mysql installation yanked out and replaced with something else so beware if you want to stay on mysql and not run the risk of things changing under your feet you may need to take a few extra steps before you upgrade below we’ll give advice on the most common scenario where you have mysql installed on debian  and you want to go to debian  and continue to run mysql upgrading to debian  and keeping mysql first and foremost if you installed mysql from the official mysql repos at repomysqlcom you are fine no need to worry since your mysql installation will be untouched by the debian upgrade on the other hand if you installed mysql from debian’s own package repos and then go ahead and upgrade to debian  debian will simply yank out mysql and forcibly replace it with a different database system with no advance warning to stay with mysql you should switch from the debian  native mysql  packages to packages from the official mysql repos  or newer in general this is advisable for several reasons among them the fact that all ga and prerelease versions of mysql together with a wide range of mysql clients tooling and utilities are all readily available and completely uptodate in the official repos now proceed as follows enable the official mysql package repos as described at httpsdevmysqlcomdownloadsrepoapt we recommend choosing the upgrade to mysql  which is at the time of writing the latest ga of mysql and which contains a huge range of new features and optimizations compared with the debian native  with  also being a good but somewhat less recent alternative switch to the official mysql packages by running aptget update and aptget distupgrade go on to upgrade to debian  by replacing all “jessie” entries with “stretch” in etcaptsourceslist and etcaptsourceslistdmysqllist then… run aptget update and aptget distupgrade the end result should be a debian  system which will have your mysql installation intact other scenarios as we mentioned above if you have mysql from the native debian  repos on your debian  system and just upgrade directly to debian  you get forcibly migrated off mysql even though the replacement claims full compatibility with mysql there are no guarantees this in turn means that if you want to move back to mysql afterwards there are also no guarantees the reason being that mariadb may have introduced settings or structures that are incompatible with mysql so while a move back to mysql will in most cases work be aware that there are risks involved another type of scenario would be that you do not have mysql installed on debian  and want to upgrade to debian  and run mysql or… you want a clean install of debian  and then want to run mysql on it in both those cases you should first install or upgrade to debian  then carry out step  above enable the official mysql repos then do aptget update and finally aptget install mysqlserver as you can see from this posting debian made some late and surprising changes in the stretch end game of course debian’s decisions are theirs to make we just hope that the advice we’ve given here will save users from getting seriously confused and possibly get caught out by having their mysql install yanked out from under their feet many of the gotchas here are unfortunately beyond our control but do let us know in the comments section below if there appears to be stuff we could do to further reduce risks for mysql users going to debian  share thisclick to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on linkedin opens in new

information type multinational conglomerate notable people michael quartermainecurrent ceoalso see current personnel elq international or edward louis quartermaine international formerly elq industries and elq enterprises is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in port charles owned by the wealthy quartermaines it is one of the largest businesses in the region it is a rival company with nearby chandler enterprises and buchanan enterprises history edward in his office at elq  in  edward quartermaine arrived in port charles having followed his son alan and brought his family company elq in  laura baldwin received a job as a secretary for edward at elq edward also enlists luke spencer to assist him and his niece alexandria in searching for the ice princess the worlds largest uncut diamond it was working for edward at elq where luke and laura finally realized their feelings and couldnt live without each other in  edward discovers what it is like to be broke when his daughterinlaw monica and her new flame sean donely organize a hostile takeover sean leaked word of a merger between donely enterprises and the cassadines edwards illegitimate son jimmy lee holt decided to sell the family stock and invest it all monica had second thoughts and tried to warn the family that the merger was a fake but they didnt listen and the quartermaines lost everything however edwards wife lila quartermaine manages to make their fortune back with a new business called picklelila monicas husband alan later faked his death to get back at sean and his wife sean being faced with a murder charge finally returned the quartermaines money when edward was presumed dead in  he left all his assets to his grandson ned ashton alan tried to keep ned and his sister tracy from getting their greedy hands on elq he appealed to the board members to vote his way and ned did the same thing to be fair ned offered alan a test each one of them would invest  million and the one who got the bigger return would get elq the tug of war continued with alan and tracy taking turns running the company resigning letting the other one take over and resigning again alan finally turned the reins over to tracy once and for all in order to stop his then wife lucy coe from constantly nagging him about elq ned was then named the new ceo in  tracys former beau david mcalister wound up murdered with tracy as the prime suspect she asked scott baldwin to defend her which he only agreed to do after he was granted the position as general counsel at elq in  elq was taking losses that concerned the quartermaines but ned assured them that a ship called the “ss tracy” was docking with machinery that would revitalize their cannery and rebuild the quartermaine money however an environmental group called the greenbelts was rallying to protest the arrival of the ship which they claimed was carrying unsafe chemicals the ship exploded in route to dock and ned was furious as he suspected the ship was sabotaged following this alan and monica realized neither ned nor tracy could run the family business and hired paul hornsby to save elq however paul was part of a drug cartel that simply wanted tracys stock shares a few months later when edward was revealed to be alive he and ned are successful at getting elq back after blackmailing paul into handing over his shares of elq in  sonny corinthos invests in elq jasper jacks also gets a spot on the elq board neither of these makes edward happy especially when jax teams up with tracy to take over elq neds wife lois was especially angry when ned resumed his post as ceo of elq to help fend off tracy and jax founder and former ceo edward louis quartermaine in  edward promises his grandson aj the ceo position at elq if he can bring ajs son michael home to the quartermaines if aj succeeds ned will be out of a job edward is forced to eat his words when aj is able to bring michael into the quartermaine fold by marrying michaels mother carly aj threatens to leave with his new family if edward doesnt fork over the ceo position so aj is appointed ceo and ned leaves telling edward that he will not come in and save the family again especially when the whole thing blows up in his face in  edward kicks aj out of the ceo position when he learns that aj has burned down sonnys warehouse and for losing michael with elq without a ceo ned will not come back edward makes an odd move in courting corporate raider jasper jacks edward hopes that ned will swoop in to save the company like he had done previously when jax tried to buy out elq but ned remains true to his promise of not returning edward has a stroke of luck when jax forgets about elq to go after a drug company to obtain medication for lilas distant cousin chloe morgan from helena cassadine jax sells his shares of elq which had come from aj and tracy to edward edward then takes over as ceo of elq in  edward is outraged when he is voted out of the ceo position in favor of his granddaughter skye chandlerquartermaine later that year when jax sells controlling interest of elq to lila edward hopes shell make him ceo again but lila tells him that he will be coceo with skye edward has no choice but to accept lilas decision when edward fakes a stroke in  lila uncertain of edwards chances of a recovery appoints ned ceo of elq ned intends to use elq to go after mobster sonny corinthos much to edwards dismay elq seen in the port charles skyline in  aj once again gets his chance to run elq when he becomes ceo after ned is falsely accused of rape however aj later empties the quartermaines bank accounts and leaves town with lydia karenin leaving edward to step in as ceo once again skye is later booted off the elq board by edward after learning that she is in fact not a quartermaine when the elqowned port charles hotel burns down thanks to faulty wiring edward wants to take responsibility for the fire but tracy convinces him that it will be best for elq if he remaines quiet while edward recoveres from a heart attack that nearly killed him edwards grandson justus ward convinces edward that he should act senile to avoid responsibility for the fire tracy takes advantage of the situation and goes after elq eventually an arson report relieves the family of responsibility for the fire and a battle for control over elq breaks out between tracy and edward with tracys son dillon holding the deciding vote dillon is forced to side with his mother and tracy is named ceo in  tracys husband luke agrees to help tracy maintain her position as ceo of elq for three months which will be long enough to solidify the position when it is time to vote for the new ceo of elq luke doesnt support his wife and she loses out to mobster lorenzo alcazar in  elq faces several lawsuits after producing faulty condoms which cause the pregnancies of elizabeth webber by edwards grandson jason morgan and lukes daughter lulu spencer by dillon edward with former ceo tracy quartermaine at elq  in  edward pitches the idea of having michael intern at elq jason tells him that michael already has a job working for sonny but it is up to michael to make the decision not giving up edward offers michaels girlfriend abby haver a wellpaying job at elq under the provision that she gets michael to work there alongside her edward is delighted when michael accepts his offer much to sonny and carlys dismay abby enjoys her work at elq but michael does not feel the same way and quits shortly after later tracy reaches out to edward when mobster anthony zacchara threatens to inform the authorities and the soleito family that she had secretly funneled her exhusband gino soleitos money into elq years before in  edward dies and wills  of his stock to his living grandchildren currently  each to aj quartermaine skye chandlerquartermaine dillon quartermaine ned ashton jason morgan even though he was missing and presumed dead at the time  to his living greatgrandchildren currently  each to michael quartermaine lila rae alcazar brook lynn ashton maya ward her mother faith was never mentioned as to whether she inherited or is deceased danny morgan and kiki jerome although shes not biologically a quartermaine she is thought to be and  each to edwards daughterinlaw monica quartermaine and the longtime quartermaine maid alice gunderson edwards daughter tracy quartermaine does not inherit any stock only the last jar of her mother lilas picklelila relish and tracy mentions that edwards son jimmy lee holt had been written out of their fathers will years before aj wants to be ceo of the company he has voting support from michael skye lila rae and monica tracy has voting support from dillon ned brook lynn maya and alice both sides are tied at  initially making sam morgan the deciding factor she has controlling interest in jasons and dannys shares she decides to split her shares to make both sides at  to break the tie secondary common shareholders initially nonvoting have the deciding vote it turns out that lucy coe former daughterinlaw of edward has  that edward didnt get back before he passed away after tracy agrees to the terms to underwrite the nurses ball lets lucy move in to the quartermaine mansion and makes lucy coceo of elq with her lucy gives her support to tracy  soon after becoming coceo lucy has a psychotic break and is confined to ferncliff asylum after attacking police detective john mcbain believing that he is vampire caleb morley aj and michael then obtain proof that tracy had funneled mob money from her deceased husband gino soleito through elq and blackmail her into resigning and naming aj ceo  tracy with former ceo aj quartermaine at elq  the government seizes the assets of elq and this prompts aj and tracy to fight for control tracy then remembers that she inherited her mothers picklelila relish which gives her the idea to save the company by marketing the relish for sale again meanwhile aj michael and the newlyhired duke lavery have the same idea and both sides scramble to find the recipe to the relish before the other aj has gh lab tech ellie trout identify the ingredients for the recipe and tracy steals the recipe she gives orders to mass produce the relish so that she can revitalize the company and vote aj out as the ceo with the assistance of the mystery quartermaine heir while talking to his exwife carly jacks aj suspects that she possibly knows about another quartermaine heir due to her reaction when he mentions that they know all the heirs carly however wont give him any information ajs cousin ned was listening in and tells his mother tracy about this tracy then asks her exhusband luke spencer to ask his niece carly for information about the heir but she only knows that the previouslyunknown grandson of edward robert frank had mentioned to her years before that he had a daughter named lauren tracy then hires private investigator damian spinelli to find lauren frank for her  tracy is forced to sign over elq to aj for enbezzling mob money into elq however damian spinelli defects to ajs side when he decides to not betray his girlfriend ellie trout a second time  tracy hires luke to track down lauren jerome francos percieved daughter and aj has spinelli track her down as well  luke gets to francos illegally adopted mothers place first and she decides to side with tracy  she gives spinelli an address to a woman that womans father had a debt to repay luke  spinelli talks to the woman and wastes time there while luke is talking to ava jerome laurens mother  luke reveals to spinelli that it was indeed him that sent spinelli on the wrong path and he assumes that luke found lauren  aj and tracy go on the chew to have a battle of the condiments  the food experts on the chew various personnel and even ajs girlfriend elizabeth get food poisoning thanks to robert franco frank who was responsible with franco now revealed to be alive and the reveal of kiki jerome is francos daughter the grandchildren now each have  of stock and  goes to each of the greatgrandchildren tracy decides to try to go through with the takeover and summons a shareholders meeting due to her majority of shareholders with her original  and ava jeromes proxy of   diane miller presides over the shareholders meeting and helps with the online voting for shareholders not present like ned dillon maya etc  it was thought that tracy would win with francos shares with ava voting giving tracy  and kiki jerome aligning with aj due to the fact her mother and her aunt called a corporate meeting the vote is taken and its revealed that aj quartermaine as of now retains his position as ceo with the  with a  shareholder flipping over to ajs side alice gunderson a  shareholder flipped over to ajs side  aj makes alice a honorary vice president and head of security then kicks ava and tracy out of his boardroom   connie falconeri then overhears sonny and morgan corinthos talking to each other about kiki not being francos biological daughter connie trying to save her paper the press from going under wants to break the story so she goes to her friend tracy for help in getting proof tracy lets connie into ava and francos bedroom where connie finds kikis birth certificate which lists silas clay as the father connie prints the story kiki not a q on the front page of the paper the next morning letting the whole town know that the elq vote was invalid since kiki didnt have the right to vote since she is not a quartermaine and therefore not included in edwards will without kiki being a stockholder edwards living greatgrandchildren are back to having  each instead of  the new percentages add up to a  tie between aj and tracy tracy then goes to lucy to secure her  of the nonvoting stock which she needs to be the tie breaker lucy gives tracy her  and breaks the tie tracy once again became ceo and aj went back to drinking soon becoming a prime suspect in connie falconeris murder after aj was murdered by sonny corinthos fluke started taking an interest in elq wanting to use it to fund his drug operation when fluke wanted to marry tracy to gain control of elq ned ashton became suspicious because of lukes pass misdeeds ned gained even more suspicion when he and michael discovered fluke was making passes at kiki jerome fluke succeeded in marrying tracy forcing ned and michael to quickly convince the other stock holders to remove tracy as ceo not wanting the position to leave the family michael stepped in and tracy vowed revenge while acting as ceo michael hired his brother morgan corinthos to oversee elqs waterfront restoration project according to michael elq had been working with the community to revitalize the
