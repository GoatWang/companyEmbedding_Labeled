temperature monitoring systemwhy is everyone talking about temperature monitoring systemsitemap ecoark an overview of how technology improves transparency laws govern the way food reaches consumers through the supply chain from harvesting to retail food has a finite shelf life and each article must meet minimum standards of appearance and freshness in addition to other parameters inefficiencies lead to delays that result in waste of fresh produce in the process suppliers may also resort to practices to minimize their loss and hide facts this is understandable when one looks at losses of over   billion annually due to waste  improving efficiencies and speeding up processes could help in avoiding this lack of transparency food supply chains rely on traditional methods of moving materials and tracking movements as well as monitoring condition of produce a simple switch to the latest food safety management system is all it takes to ensure food is delivered fresh and waste is avoided technology applied to harvesting helps reduce waste and improve technology by tracking and prioritizing pallets waiting for the precooling process prior to shipment those in charge can take informed decisions to match pallets to specific orders when they have information right at their fingertips even during the cooling process the it solution enables quality checkers to track product temperatures during the process and notify workers when it is complete it does not stop there as transportation is another roadblock during this stage fresh produce can remain unmonitored but not anymore when intelligent tracking systems are in place to ensure critical monitoring and coordination remote visibility powered by technology allows higher visibility of the product in various stages to help buyers or dealers accept or reject a product even before it is shipped or before it reaches the end point sellers can use technology to find other buyers and divert the produce instead of having to discard it  food safety management systems even take care of visual inspection of fresh produce to check freshness at all stages not just at the last stage one way this can prove helpful reduce waste and improve transparency is that sellers can then route such products according to various stages of freshness to nearest points of sale or consumption  typically logistics of fresh produce movement starts with harvesting and the steps involve cut to cool precooling staging shipping transit wholesale distribution and end point that may be retail or hotel or food processing an intelligent well thought out and implement software solution factors in all these stages and ensures greater transparency for all those involved not only to be better informed but to handle challenges peculiar to each stage waste that is currently in billions of dollars could reduce to a fraction of the amount transparency powered by software leads to greater collaboration and better coordination resulting in reduced waste food is consumed not discarded  the comprehensive solution covers all aspects in a modular form including pallet level tracking precooling stage pallet routing intransit monitoring freshness quality management and remote visibility a smartphone and internet connection is all it takes for everyone to share and collaborate on best food produce handling techniques in an
