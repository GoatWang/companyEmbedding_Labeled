 wikipedia matrix multiplication from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search multiplication of two matrices illustrated with a × and a × matrix with arbitrary symbols in mathematics matrix multiplication or the matrix product is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices the definition is motivated by linear equations and linear transformations on vectors which have numerous applications in applied mathematics physics and engineering in more detail if a is an n × m matrix and b is an m × p matrix their matrix product ab is an n × p matrix in which the m entries across a row of a are multiplied with the m entries down a columns of b and summed to produce an entry of ab when two linear transformations are represented by matrices then the matrix product represents the composition of the two transformations the matrix product is not commutative in general although it is associative and is distributive over matrix addition the identity element of the matrix product is the identity matrix analogous to multiplying numbers by  and a square matrix may have an inverse matrix analogous to the multiplicative inverse of a number determinant multiplicativity applies to the matrix product the matrix product is also important for matrix groups and the theory of group representations and irreps computing matrix products is both a central operation in many numerical algorithms and potentially time consuming making it one of the most wellstudied problems in numerical computing various algorithms have been devised for computing c  ab

and matrices are italic since they are numbers from a field eg a and a index notation is often the clearest way to express definitions and is used as standard in the literature the i j entry of matrix a is indicated by aij or aij whereas a numerical label not matrix entries on a collection of matrices is subscripted only eg a a etc matrix product two matricesedit assume two matrices are to be
