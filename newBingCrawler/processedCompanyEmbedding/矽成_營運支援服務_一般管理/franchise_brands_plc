what is a franchise  international franchise association skip to main content search form search fransocial login home  about franchising  franchising   intro to franchising what is a franchise   what is a franchise franchising is simply a method for expanding a business and distributing goods and services through a licensing relationship  in franchising franchisors a person or company that grants the license to a third party for the conducting of a business under their marks not only specify the products and services that will be offered by the franchisees a person or company who is granted the license to do business under the trademark and trade name by the franchisor but also provide them with an operating system brand and support  a brief separate glossary of franchising terms is available on ifa’s website at httpwwwfranchiseorgwhatarecommonfranchiseterms business format franchising there are two different types of franchising relationships business format franchising is the type most identifiable to the average person  in a business format franchise relationship the franchisor provides to the franchisee not just its trade name products and services but an entire system for operating the business  the franchisee generally receives site selection and development support operating manuals training brand standards quality control a marketing strategy and business advisory support from the franchisor  more than  diverse industries use franchising as their route to market including automotive business services commercial and residential services education lodging personal services quick service restaurants fast food real estate retail food retail products and services senior care and medical services tablefull service restaurants traditional or product distribution while less identified with franchising traditional or product distribution franchising is actually larger in total sales than business format franchising  in a traditional franchise the focus is not on the system of doing business but mainly on the products manufactured or supplied by the franchisor to the franchisee  in most but not in all situations the manufactured products generally need pre and postsale service as found in the automobile industry examples of traditional or product distribution franchising can be found in the bottling gasoline automotive and other manufacturers franchising is about relationships many people when they think of franchising focus first on the law  while the law is certainly important it is not the central thing to understand about franchising  at its core franchising is about the franchisor’s brand value how the franchisor supports its franchisees how the franchisee meets its obligations to deliver the products and services to the system’s brand standards and most importantly – franchising is about the relationship that the franchisor has with its franchisees  in a  survey by franchise business review on franchisees’ relationship with their franchisors it was determined    percent enjoy operating their business  percent of franchisees enjoy being part of their organization  percent feel positive about their affiliation with their franchisor  percent respect their franchisor  percent feel their franchisor operates with a high level of honesty  percent would recommend their franchise brand to others and  percent would “do it all over again” if they had the option   franchising is about brands a franchisor’s brand is its most valuable asset and consumers decide which business to shop at and how often to frequent that business based on what they know or think they know about the brand  to a certain extent consumers really don’t care who owns the business so long as their brand expectations are met if you become a franchisee you will certainly be developing a relationship with your customers to maintain their loyalty and most certainly customers will choose to purchase from you because of the quality of your services and the personal relationship you establish with them  but first and foremost they have trust in the brand to meet their expectations and the franchisor and the other franchisees in the system rely upon you to meet those expectations  franchising is about systems and support great franchisors provide systems tools and support so that their franchisees have the ability to live up to the system’s brand standards and ensure customer satisfaction  and franchisors and all of the other franchisees expect that you will independently manage the daytoday operation of your businesses so that you will enhance the reputation of the company in your market area when selecting a franchise system to invest in you want to evaluate the types of support you will be provided and how well the franchisor is managing the evolution of the products and services so that it keeps up with changing consumer expectations  some of the more common services that franchisors provide to franchisees include             a recognized brand name             site selection and site development assistance             training for you and your management team             research and development of new products and services             headquarters and field support             initial and continuing marketing and advertising you want to select a franchisor that routinely and effectively enforces system standards  this is important to you as enforcement of brand standards by the franchisor is meant to protect franchisees from the possible bad acts of other franchisees that share the brand with them  since customers see franchise systems as a branded chain of operations great products and services delivered by one franchisee benefits the entire system the opposite is also true franchising is also a contractual relationship while from the public’s vantage point franchises look like any other chain of branded businesses they are very different  in a franchise system the owner of the brand does not manage and operate the locations that serve consumers their products and services on a daytoday basis  serving the consumer is the role and responsibility of the franchisee franchising is a contractual relationship between a licensor franchisor and a licensee franchisee that allows the business owner to use the licensor’s brand and method of doing business to distribute products or services to consumers while every franchise is a license not every license is a franchise under the law sometimes that can be very confusing in the united states a franchise is a specific type of licensing arrangement defined by the federal trade commission and also by several states  in the united states a franchise generally exists when             the franchisor licenses a franchisee the right to use its trade or service mark to identify the franchisee’s business in marketing a product or service using the franchisor’s operating methods             the franchisor provides the franchisee with support and exercises certain controls and             the franchisee pays the franchisor a fee the definition of a franchise is not uniform in every state  some states for example may also include a marketing plan or community of interest provision in the definition  the definition of what is a franchise can vary significantly under the laws in some states and it is important that you don’t simply rely on the federal definition of a franchise in understanding any particular state’s requirements put another way in a franchise a business the franchisor licenses its trade name the brand such as brightstar or sport clips and its operating methods its system of doing business to a person or group operating within a specific territory or location the franchisee which agrees to operate its business according to the terms of a contract the franchising agreement  the franchisor provides the franchisee with franchising leadership and support and exercises some controls to ensure the franchisee’s adherence to brand guidelines in exchange the franchisee usually pays the franchisor a onetime initial fee the franchise fee and a continuing fee known as a royalty for the use of the franchisor’s trade name and operating methods  the franchisee is responsible for the daytoday management of its independently owned business and benefits or risks loss based on his own performance and capabilities investing in a franchise or becoming a franchisor can be a great opportunity  but before you select any franchise investment and sign any franchise agreement do your homework understand what the franchise system is offering and get the support of a qualified franchise lawyer next steps  the international franchise association has over  franchisor members

franchise or trademark license agreements homecooperation small and mediumsized enterprises ip for business licensing franchise or trademark license agreements if your sme is interested in marketing a product or service and the brand trademark of that product is owned by others or entering or expanding the existing market for your product or service for which your sme owns the rights conferred by a trademark you may consider a trademark license agreement or a franchise agreement the principle function of a trademark or service mark is to distinguish the goods and services of one enterprise from that of another thereby often identifying the source and making an implied reference to quality and reputation this function is to some extent prejudiced if the trademark owner licenses another enterprise to use the trademark through a trademark license agreement therefore the trademark owner is well advised and often by law or contract required to maintain a close connection with the licensee to ensure that the quality standards are maintained so that the consumer is not deceived through a franchise agreement the owner of certain technical or other expertise who has usually gained a reputation in connection with the use of a trade or service mark the franchiser may team up with another enterprise franchisee who will bring in expertise of his own or financial resources to provide goods or services directly to the consumer the franchiser will ensure through the supply of technical and management skills that the franchisee maintains the quality and other standards in relation to the use of the trade or service mark which often require certain standardized features like for example a uniform trade dress copyright license agreements if your sme is interested in manufacturing distributing or marketing the results of the literary and artistic efforts of creators or entering a market or expanding or extending your existing market for the literary and artistic efforts of your enterprise you may consider a copyright license agreement many owners find it difficult to manage their rights on their own and they have formed collective management organizations that represent them and manage their rights for them if you are interested in acquiring these rights you may have to address yourself to the appropriate collective management organization that will be

is now considered to be in the public domain  march  franchise brands plc “franchise brands” “the group” or “the company” proposed acquisition of metro rod limited “metro rod” proposed placing by way of an accelerated bookbuild to raise up to £ million notice of general meeting and restoration of trading on aim franchise brands today announces that terms have been conditionally agreed for the proposed acquisition of the entire issued share capital of metro rod for a total consideration of £ million subject to adjustment based on the financial position of metro rod at completion “the acquisition” the company also announces its intention to conduct a placing with certain institutional and other investors and the directors to raise gross proceeds of up to approximately £ million at  pence per ordinary share in order to partially fund the acquisition the “placing” the placing is being conducted through an accelerated bookbuilding process the “bookbuild” which will be launched immediately following this announcement metro rod is a leading provider of drain clearance and maintenance services delivered  on a largely reactive basis by  regional franchisees with geographical coverage across the majority of the uk  founded in  the directors believe metro rod has grown to become one of only five companies in the drainage sector operating on a national basis metro rod serves national business customers across multiple sectors including facilities management retail water utilities social housing hospitality and insurance as well as local businesses and other customers in the private and public sectors the directors believe the acquisition represents a transformational step in respect of franchise brands’ strategy to pursue the selective acquisition of franchise businesses that could benefit from the company’s central services such as marketing and also the experience of the board and management team in developing franchise businesses highlights ● metro rod is a leading provider profitable and a cash generative business with an experienced management team a mature and stable franchise network and high customer retention rates   ● the directors believe the acquisition will be significantly earnings enhancing for the group as metro rod is being purchased by the group at a price the directors consider attractive and the combined businesses’ strong cashflow and balance sheet provide an opportunity to utilise debt to finance the acquisition   ● the total consideration of £ million subject to adjustment based on the financial position of metro rod at completion of the acquisition for the acquisition together with estimated costs of approximately £ million and additional working capital will be funded by the issue of the placing shares to raise up to approximately £ million and new bank facilities of up to £ million   ● the directors believe that under the guidance of the board and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses the development of metro rod may be accelerated through       o providing additional sales and marketing support to franchisees in the development of commercial accounts       o further developing key accounts in sectors where metro rod’s penetration could be increased on a relative basis       o the development of the recently launched metro plumb business through investment in additional sales and marketing and       o longer term extending the “metro” brand into other bb sectors ● the acquisition represents an opportunity to leverage franchise brands’ and metro rod’s complementary strengths in the provision of shared services for example franchise brands has significant expertise in marketing which the directors believe will accelerate the development of metro rod’s existing business and the newly launched metro plumb business in contrast metro rod has a substantial call centre capability whereas franchise brands currently outsources this function the directors believe that combining the finance teams will also provide the potential for an enhanced finance function for the enlarged group     ● the addition of metro rod to the group will substantially increase the size and scale of the group’s operations this will potentially allow certain functions that were previously subscale to be optimised and certain outsourced functions to be brought inhouse over time     ● metro rod increased operating profit before exceptional items by approximately  per cent from £ million in the financial year ended  april  to £ million in the financial year ended  april    ● metro rod generates substantially all its income from fees related to system sales which the directors believe will improve the enlarged group’s overall quality of income and return from growing franchisee turnover  it also operates in a defensive sector partly due to the emergency nature of the demand for its services ● the directors believe that the bb expertise and operational capabilities within metro rod combined with the scale of the enlarged group will also allow the board to evaluate an increased range of future potential acquisition opportunities in the bb as well as bc sectors given the scale of the acquisition when compared to the existing group the transaction is a reverse takeover under the aim rules and requires the company to issue a new admission document and is conditional inter alia on the approval by shareholders of the resolutions to be proposed at a general meeting  accordingly the company has published the admission document “admission document” including details of the general meeting and resolutions which will be posted to shareholders today and is available on the company’s website at wwwfranchisebrandscouk the directors consider the acquisition to be an excellent opportunity for the group and in the best interests of the company and shareholders as a whole accordingly the

operated by the london stock exchange neither the content of the company’s website nor any website accessible by hyperlinks on the company’s website is incorporated in or forms part of this announcement background to and rationale for the acquisition the board is pleased to inform shareholders that terms have been agreed for the proposed acquisition of the entire issued share capital of metro rod a leading provider of drain clearance and maintenance services which are delivered on a largely reactive basis by regional franchisees the total consideration for the acquisition is £ million subject to adjustment based on the financial position of metro rod at completion of the acquisition which together with estimated costs of approximately £ million will be satisfied in cash at completion of the acquisition it is proposed that the consideration associated costs and additional working capital will be funded by the issue of the placing shares to raise up to approximately £ million and new bank facilities of up to £ million given the scale of the acquisition when compared to the existing group the transaction is a reverse takeover under the aim rules and therefore requires the company to issue a new admission document and obtain shareholder approval for the acquisition the group’s strategy as outlined at the time of its ipo was to pursue the selective acquisition of franchise businesses that could benefit from the company’s central services such as marketing and also the experience of the board and management team in developing franchise businesses the group completed its first acquisition since the ipo of barking mad in october  the acquisition of barking mad broadened franchise brands’ portfolio of bc service businesses with a market leading brand which the directors believe has an attractive model for franchisees a strong management team and a similar customer base to the group’s existing brands the directors believe the acquisition represents a transformational step in respect of implementing the group’s stated buy and build strategy in particular the directors believe the acquisition represents an opportunity to enter the bb franchising market at a size and scale that is attractive strategically and at an acquisition price that the directors consider is significantly accretive to shareholders furthermore the directors believe the range of potential future acquisition opportunities for the group is likely to be increased as a result of the acquisition as both the bb and bc franchise sectors would be within its scope the directors also believe the acquisition is likely to lead to an enhanced range of shared services within the enlarged group which have the capability to be leveraged across its range of brands and furthermore will potentially allow the enlarged group to optimise some activities that were previously subscale metro rod is a well established and profitable business with an experienced management team who have continued to grow the business through several changes of ownership however the directors believe that under the guidance of the board and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses the development of metro rod may be accelerated the board believes the acquisition is positive for the group for the following reasons ● significantly earningsenhancing the directors believe metro rod is being purchased by the group at an attractive price of approximately  times operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended  april  and that the acquisition will therefore be significantly earnings enhancing for the group metro rod also benefits from a strong cashflow which when combined with the existing group’s robust cashflow and strong balance sheet provides an opportunity to utilise debt to finance the enlarged group and further enhance earnings per share ● potential for growth in earnings the directors believe metro rod’s earnings will grow as a result of the continued development of the core business development of the recently launched metro plumb business and longer term the additional extension of the “metro” brand into other bb sectors ● defensive sector metro rod’s business model has historically demonstrated resilience through changes in the economic cycle the directors believe this is partly due to emergency nature of the demand for its services ● experienced management metro rod has an experienced and long standing management team who have continued to grow the business through several changes of ownership under the guidance of the experienced board and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses the directors believe that this team will thrive ● quality of income metro rod generates substantially all its income from fees related to system sales and does not rely on income from franchisee recruitment or resales the directors believe this will improve the enlarged group’s overall quality of income and improve the return to the enlarged group from growing franchisee turnover ● opportunities to leverage shared services the directors believe franchise brands and metro rod have complementary strengths in the provision of shared services for example franchise brands has significant expertise in marketing which the directors believe will accelerate the development of metro rod’s existing business and the newly launched metro plumb business in contrast metro rod has a substantial call centre capability whereas franchise brands currently outsources this function the directors believe that combining the finance teams will also provide the potential for an enhanced finance function for the enlarged group ● benefits of operational scale the addition of metro rod to the group will substantially increase the size and scale of the group’s operations this will potentially allow certain functions that were previously subscale to be optimised and certain outsourced functions to be brought inhouse over time ● increased range of future potential acquisition opportunities metro rod is predominantly a bb business whereas the group’s existing brands are bc businesses the directors believe that the bb expertise and operational capabilities within metro rod combined with the scale of the enlarged group will also allow the board to evaluate an increased range of future potential acquisition opportunities in the bb as well as bc sectors information on metro rod history of metro rod metro rod was founded in  and has subsequently grown to become the directors believe one of only five companies in its sector operating on a national basis since  metro rod has been part of a group of companies which in  was renamed the enserve group the enserve group is a private group of businesses providing infrastructure support services to the utilities sector the enserve group has been under private equity ownership since  most recently by funds managed or advised by rubicon partners llp and grovepoint capital llp metro plumb was launched by metro rod in february  and provides cold water plumbing services primarily to key account customers all metro rod franchisees were given the opportunity to purchase metro plumb franchises covering their respective territories and  of the existing  metro rod franchisees have done so the directors believe that metro plumb represents a natural brand extension of the types of emergency response services metro rod is able to provide whilst seeking to leverage its existing infrastructure kemac was established in  and is a company owned operation and not franchised it built its reputation on providing services to the water utilities market and more recently by providing plumbing services kemac provides plumbing related services to thames water and services to other water companies kemac also operates six metro plumb territories predominantly in and near the greater london area the metro rod business metro rod is a leading provider of drain clearance and maintenance services delivered on a largely reactive basis the services are predominantly provided by a total of  franchisees with geographical coverage across the majority of the uk metro rod serves national business customers across multiple sectors including facilities management retail water utilities social housing hospitality and insurance as well as local businesses and other customers in the private and public sectors domestic customers form only a small part of metro rod’s business a focus of metro rod is to provide a  emergency response service to customers through its operating model of key accounts and commercial accounts the service is provided by regional franchisees who on average have been with metro rod for  years with extensive support from a large head office team of approximately  people the franchise network metro rod has a mature and stable franchise network since may  it has had between  to  franchisees the decrease to  franchisees at present primarily reflects the consolidation of a number of franchise territories the franchise is a management franchise in that the franchisee manages individuals who provide the service there are over  engineers in the metro rod network on average franchisees have eight engineers and operate seven vans the average length of tenure of a franchisee is approximately  years the longest tenure is currently  years metro rod typically resells two to three franchises every year when franchisees retire andor are replaced and these area sales represent a small additional source of revenue for metro rod average gross revenue per franchisee has grown steadily in recent years to reach nearly £ in the financial year ended  april  no reliance is placed on a single franchisee with the largest accounting for  per cent of total key account and commercial account revenues since february  kemac has operated the metro plumb franchise territory areas in london reading and guildford on behalf of metro rod southampton bournemouth edinburgh and glasgow are vacant plumbing franchise areas with services currently provided on a subcontracted basis the franchise model the directors believe that the metro rod franchise model which includes metro plumb is a collaborative and mutually dependent one whereby the franchisees fulfil work which is mostly procured by the franchisor franchisees are awarded the right to operate the brand in geographicallydefined territories on an exclusive basis territories are identified by postcodes metro rod as the brand owner licenses the brand and intellectual property to the franchisee the franchise agreement provides that each franchisee pays an initial franchise fee or renewal fee to metro rod and an ongoing msf for the use of the brand the retention of the territory and the provision of the initial and ongoing services and support metro rod’s franchise business model involves the provision of a range of central support services to its franchisees an important service is business management support in particular the provision of key account sales which account for approximately  per cent of the franchisee’s revenues each franchisee enters into a franchise agreement which grants them the right to trade under the relevant brand for a five year term subject to the franchisee having substantially observed and performed the terms of the franchise agreement and certain other conditions the franchisee is eligible to be awarded a renewal of the agreement for a further five year term metro rod is not obliged to offer more than two renewal franchises the franchisor can only decline to renew or terminate on grounds set out in the franchise agreement which include amongst other things nonperformance and reputational damage franchisees are responsible for the purchase of their own equipment and the hiring of specialist equipment for more complex work the standard msf is  per cent of gross revenue minus an allowance for deductible items the current franchise agreements provide for a marketing contribution of  per cent of gross revenue however metro rod does not currently collect this from the franchisees metro rod’s accounts department are responsible for all invoicing on behalf of franchisees for key accounts and commercial accounts franchisees are paid for servicing key accounts regardless of whether metro rod has received payment and metro rod bears the credit risk for these accounts franchisees bear the credit risk for commercial accounts and are paid on average after  days payment terms for key accounts are typically  days however the franchisees are paid on average after  days this explains the working capital requirement for metro rod which is unusual in a franchise business customers metro rod serves national business customers across multiple sectors including facilities management retail water utilities social housing hospitality and insurance as well as local businesses and other customers in the private and public sectors customers include many large national and wellknown companies domestic customers form only a small part of metro rod’s business in the last three financial years metro rod franchisees have carried out over  jobs per annum in the financial year ended  april  more than  jobs were completed average gross revenue per job in the financial year ended  april  was approximately £ excluding vat total system sales were approximately £ million in the financial year ended  april  unaudited statutory revenues for metro rod in the financial year ended  april  were £ million and proforma revenues which include the contribution of kemac and other adjustments were £ million of the proforma £ million £ million related to revenue from key accounts £ million from commercial accounts and £ million from kemac key account sales relate to national customer accounts won and maintained by the metro rod central sales team commercial accounts relate to work secured directly by the franchisee primarily from commercial customers within their franchise area as a result of their local marketing initiatives key accounts metro rod has over  key account customers in the financial year ended  april  facilities management customers accounted for approximately  per cent of total key account customer revenues and retail customers accounted for approximately  per cent metro rod has a high customer retention rate in the last three financial years the retention rate for key account customers was over  per cent key account customers include many large national and wellknown companies in the facilities management hospitality healthcare and construction sectors in the financial year ended  april  metro rod’s top  key account customers accounted for  per cent of total revenue as a result the directors believe there is limited dependence on any one individual key account customer the largest customer accounts for approximately  per cent of total revenues and has been a customer for  years key account contracts are generally organised through a framework or preferred supplier agreement which have a typical duration of one to three years while the agreements do not generally include volume guarantees they document callout rates which tend to be fixed through the duration of the agreements the callout rates vary by customer key account prices are set nationally and are mandatory on all franchisees to use metro rod’s services key account customers report an issue to the  central call centre which allocates a job to the relevant franchisee the customer is invoiced by metro rod’s head office which also collects payment retaining an approximate margin of  per cent while the msf is set as  per cent the margin is  per cent as metro rod allows franchisees to exclude certain allowable expenses in calculating the msf the remaining approximately  per cent is paid to the franchisee which is treated as a direct cost to metro rod in its accounts the full invoice value is recorded as revenue by metro rod commercial accounts franchisees service approximately  commercial account customers commercial account sales are an important focus of franchisee business plans however franchisees must service key accounts ahead of commercial accounts there is no typical commercial account although they include small and medium sized enterprises in the franchise territory local public sector institutions such as county councils hospitals and educational establishments and nonprofit organisations such as housing associations and charities key characteristics of a quality commercial customer are a repeat element to their business a high footfall on their premises premises that are sensitive to disruption from drainage problems or customers that have a budget allocated through public funding metro rod’s head office is responsible for raising the sales invoice in respect of commercial accounts on behalf of the franchisee and collecting payment following payment by the customer approximately  per cent is retained by metro rod ie the msf of  per cent minus the allowance for deductible items and the remainder is passed on to the franchisee providing the service only the msf is taken to statutory income by metro rod and therefore commercial accounts effectively generate a  per cent gross profit margin the market for metro rod’s services drainage the drain clearance and maintenance market is well established according to a report by the department for environment food and rural affairs in  the uk had over  kilometres of sewers and these collected approximately  billion litres of waste water on a daily basis according to water uk there are approximately  sewer blockages a year in the uk drainage system blockages can be caused by a number of factors including a buildup of silt sewage general debris fat oil or grease or blockages caused by materials or objects which are unsuitable for flushing structural problems with drains can be caused by subsidence tree root intrusion pipe corrosion or breakage in addition when there is heavy or prolonged rainfall flooding may occur and drains may be subjected to large amounts of water which can lead to blockages these problems can become exacerbated if drains have not been properly cleaned out or maintained the uk’s dated drainage system is also a contributing factor the key accounts that metro rod services operate in large and well established markets they include facilities management companies retailers water companies social housing providers and hospitality and construction companies approximately  per cent of metro rod’s services are provided on a reactive basis and therefore the directors believe that consistency of availability of the service and speed of completion is key the latter is key when drainage is critical to the business or sensitive to disruption for example businesses which have customer footfall the directors also believe that price is a consideration for customers in these sectors the directors believe that metro rod is one of only five companies in its field operating on a national basis the other four companies are dyno rod lanes for drains ansa drainage solutions and drain doctor summary information on each key

indication of future results enlarged group strategy the strategy of the enlarged group is to develop franchise businesses that provide primarily services to individuals and businesses the execution of the strategy will be achieved through organic growth and acquisition metro rod the enlarged group intends to develop the metro rod business in a number of areas including ● providing additional sales and marketing support to franchisees in the development of commercial accounts ● further developing key accounts in sectors where metro rod’s penetration could be increased on a relative basis ● developing metro plumb through investment in additional sales and marketing and ● longer term extending the “metro” brand into other bb service sectors barking mad the directors believe there is substantial scope to grow barking mad’s system sales by supporting franchisees’ growth through leveraging the group’s established central support services in particular marketing the directors also believe there is an opportunity over time to increase the number of franchised territories from the current  territories to over  territories the group also intends to explore opportunities to extend the barking mad brand in related segments of the market chipsaway and ovenclean the enlarged group intends to continue to actively expand the chipsaway and ovenclean franchise systems through recruiting new franchisees as well as improving franchisee retention rates the directors believe this will improve the quality of earnings by increasing the contribution from recurring msf income the enlarged group aims to continue to support existing franchisees in particular existing chipsaway franchisees who wish to grow their businesses through the development of carcare centres myhome during  the group continued to trial the myhome brand to establish if a full relaunch would be economically worthwhile the total costs incurred in  were £ the directors concluded that a full relaunch of the domestic cleaning business would not be in shareholders’ long term interest given the damage previously done to the brand and a number of other parties using all or part of the myhome name these costs will therefore not recur in future years the group’s research did however highlight other opportunities in the domestic services sector particularly for small repairs and maintenance to test this opportunity the group has a single franchisee operating under the brand “the handyman van” using similar branding to myhome this test will be cost neutral for the group acquisitions the enlarged group intends to grow by acquisition focusing on both bb and bc franchisee businesses where the directors believe that the enlarged group’s financial and management resources can add value in particular to businesses which have the following characteristics ● a market presence has been established however the businesses have reached a level where the existing management cannot grow them further ● sales and marketing resources are not economically available ● the next stage of growth will require the investment of additional capital not available to the existing owners and ● in addition to one or more of the requirements above the shareholders of the businesses wish to achieve a realisation of their investment or convert their investment into a more marketable form the directors believe the acquisition of metro rod is a transformational step in the group’s buy and build strategy and brings with it a number of exciting potential opportunities the directors believe the development of these opportunities which are anticipated to include the need for investment in marketing and information technology as well as require significant senior management time should remain the near term focus of the enlarged group current trading and prospects franchise brands the group announced its audited annual results for the financial year ended  december  on  march  since  january  the group has continued to trade in line with management expectations and the board expects this to continue through the rest of  the directors believe that the enlarged group’s prospects will be enhanced by the acquisition as well as the group’s recent acquisition of barking mad the directors believe that the integration of barking mad into the group is progressing well and that it is beginning to benefit from the group’s support services particularly in the areas of marketing and it a further update on the enlarged group’s results for the sixmonth period ending  june  will be provided in the enlarged group’s next interim accounts which will be published not later than  september  the total number of chipsaway and ovenclean franchisees in the uk has increased by over  over the last year and with the acquisition of barking mad the total number of uk franchisees as at the date of the admission document stands at  metro rod since  november  metro rod has continued to trade in line with the previous year despite very dry weather particularly in december  which has had a negative effect on reactive drainage services the directors believe that under the guidance of the board and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses the development of metro rod can be accelerated the total number of franchisees within metro rod has remained stable since  april  at around  principal terms and conditions of the acquisition under the terms of the acquisition agreement the company has conditionally agreed to acquire metro rod for a cash consideration of £ million payable in full at completion of the acquisition which takes place on admission subject to certain adjustments based on the financial position of metro rod at completion the acquisition agreement contains customary warranties and indemnities from the vendor in favour of the company subject to certain limitations in particular as to the maximum amounts which may be claimed the company has taken out warranty and indemnity insurance to provide additional protection in respect of any claims that may arise under such warranties and indemnities financial effects of the acquisition in the year ended  april  metro rod recorded an operating profit before exceptional items of approximately £ million the consideration therefore represents a multiple of approximately  times operating profit before exceptional items which the directors consider attractive for a business where they believe they can add significantly to sales and profit growth in addition to the consideration the company will incur total costs for the acquisition placing and admission of approximately £ million resulting in a total funding requirement of £ million the acquisition placing and admission will be funded by the placing and the term loan it is anticipated that the net assets of metro rod at completion of the acquisition will be approximately£ million giving rise to a maximum goodwill of £ million consideration will be given to the valuation of trademarks and other intangible assets in calculating the final goodwill amount transaction costs will be written off or charged against the share premium account arising on the issue of new shares in accordance with ifrs accounting standards the life of trademarks and intangible assets will be assessed and will be subject to either amortisation or periodic impairment reviews the company also intends to repay the outstanding balance of the loan notes which stood at £ million at  december  prior to admission repayment of the loan notes will be funded from the group’s existing cash resources repayment of the loan notes will allow hsbc to be the only lender to the enlarged group with the exception of a small hire purchase debt of approximately £ million shareholders’ funds at  december  for the company stood at £ million the addition of £ million of new equity capital less all transaction costs will increase this to £ million the term loan will be the only borrowings of the enlarged group at completion of the acquisition with the exception of a small hire purchase debt of approximately £ million the company’s cash balances at  december  were £ million after adjusting for the repayment of the loan notes net capital gearing at completion of the acquisition will therefore be approximately  per cent operating profit before exceptional items of the group in the year to  december  was £ million and was £ million for metro rod in the year ended  april  giving a total pro forma operating profit before exceptional items in the last full financial year for the enlarged group of £ million at completion of the acquisition the ratio of net debt to operating profit before exceptional items will therefore be  times the board the board currently consists of seven directors who between them have substantial experience of franchising and the board composition will not change as a result of the acquisition stephen hemsley and nigel wray have a longstanding and successful track record in investing in and growing franchise businesses dating back to  the directors also have considerable

facilities agreement and demand immediate repayment of all moneys and liabilities upon an occurrence of certain events of default as set out in the facilities agreement information on the placing the
