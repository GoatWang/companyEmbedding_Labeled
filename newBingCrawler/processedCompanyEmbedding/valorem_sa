of passages that there are between the producer and the final consumer a vat is an indirect tax in that the tax is collected from someone other than the person who actually bears the cost of the tax

into the united states because the amount of duty owed is often based on the value of the imported commodity ad valorem taxes mainly real property tax and sales taxes are a major source of revenues for state and municipal governments especially in jurisdictions that do not employ a personal income tax virtually all state and local sales taxes in the united states are ad valorem ad valorem is used most frequently to refer to the value placed on property by the county tax assessors an assessment is made against this value by applying an assessment rate eg    etc the net assessment is determined after subtracting any exemptions to which the property owner is entitled eg homestead exemptions and a tax or millage rate is applied to this net assessment to determine the ad valorem tax due from the property owner the two main basis for determining the ad valorem value are fair market value and current use value the fair market value is based on the typical selling price for property on which the buyer and seller can agree with the assumption that the property is being used or will be used at its highest and best use after the sale the current use value is the typical selling price for property with an assumption that it will continue after the sale to be used in its current use rather than being converted to its highest and best use state legislatures have created many variations to these two main valuation approaches in some states a central appraisal authority establishes values on all properties and distributes these to the local county or jurisdiction taxing authority which then sets a tax rate and imposes the local ad valorem tax in other states a central appraisal authority values certain properties that are difficult to value at the local level eg railroads electric companies and other utility companies and sends these values to the local county or jurisdiction taxing authority while the local tax assessors determine the value on all other property in the county or jurisdiction ad valorem tax most frequently referred to as property tax relates to the tax that results when the net assessed value of a property is multiplied times the millage rate applicable to that property this millage rate is usually expressed as a multiple of  of a dollar thus the fractional amount of  will be expressed as  mill when expressed as an ad valorem

system is imposed by a series of european union directives the most important of which is the sixth vat directive directive ec nevertheless some member states have negotiated variable rates madeira in portugal or vat exemption for regions or territories the regions below fall out of the scope of eu vat åland islands finland heligoland island büsingen territory germany guadeloupe martinique french guiana réunion france mount athos greece ceuta melilla the canary islands spain livigno campione ditalia lake lugano italy gibraltar the channel islands united kingdom under the eu system of vat where a person carrying on an economic activity supplies goods and services to another person and the value of the supplies passes financial limits the supplier is required to register with the local taxation authorities and charge its customers and account to the local taxation authority for vat although the price may be inclusive of vat so vat is included as part of the agreed price or exclusive of vat so vat is payable in addition to the agreed price vat that is charged by a business and paid by its customers is known as output vat that is vat on its output supplies vat that is paid by a business to other businesses on the supplies that it receives is known as input vat that is vat on its input supplies a business is generally able to recover input vat to the extent that the input vat is attributable to that is used to make its taxable outputs input vat is recovered by setting it against the output vat for which the business is required to account to the government or if there is an excess by claiming a repayment from the government different rates of vat apply in different eu member states the minimum standard rate of vat throughout the eu is  although reduced rates of vat as low as  are applied in various states on various sorts of supply for example domestic fuel and power in the uk the maximum rate in the eu is  the sixth vat directive requires certain goods and services to be exempt from vat for example postal services medical care lending insurance betting and certain other goods and services to be exempt from vat but subject to the ability of an eu member state to opt to charge vat on those supplies such as land and certain financial services input vat that is attributable to exempt supplies is not recoverable although a business can increase its prices so the customer effectively bears the cost of the sticking vat the effective rate will be lower than the headline rate and depend on the balance between previously taxed input and labour at the exempt stage finally some goods and services are zerorated the zerorate is a positive rate of tax calculated at  supplies subject to the zerorate are still taxable supplies ie they have vat charged on them in the uk examples include most food books drugs and certain kinds of transport the zerorate is not featured in the eu sixth directive as it was intended that the minimum vat rate throughout europe would be  however zerorating remains in some member states most notably the uk as a legacy of preeu legislation these member states have been granted a derogation to continue existing zerorating but cannot add new goods or services the uk also exempts or lowers the rate on some products depending on situation for example milk products are exempt from vat but if you go into a restaurant and drink a milk drink it is vatable some products such as feminine hygiene products and baby products nappies etc are charged at  vat along with domestic fuel when goods are imported into the eu from other states vat is generally charged at the border at the same time as customs duty acquisition vat is payable when goods are acquired in one eu member state from another eu member state this is done not at the border but through an accounting mechanism eu businesses are often required to charge themselves vat under the reverse charge mechanism where services are received from another member state or from outside of the eu businesses can be required to register for vat in eu member states other than the one in which they are based if they supply goods via mail order to those states over a certain threshold businesses that are established in one member state but which receive supplies in another member state may be able to reclaim vat charged in the second state under the provisions of the eighth vat directive directive ec to do so businesses have a value added tax identification number a similar directive the thirteenth vat directive directive ec also allows businesses established outside the eu to recover vat in certain circumstances following changes introduced on july   under directive ec noneu businesses providing digital electronic commerce and entertainment products and services to eu countries are also required to register with the tax authorities in the relevant eu member state and to collect vat on their sales at the appropriate rate according to the location of the purchaser alternatively under a special scheme noneu businesses may register and account for vat on only one eu member state this produces distortions as the rate of vat is that of the member state of registration not where the customer is located and an alternative approach is therefore under negotiation whereby vat is charged at the rate of the member state where the purchaser is located the differences between different rates of vat was often originally justified by certain products being luxuries and thus bearing high rates of vat whereas other items were deemed to be essentials and thus bearing lower rates of vat however often high rates persisted long after the argument was no longer valid for instance france taxed cars as a luxury product  up into the s when most of the french households owned one or more cars similarly in the uk clothing for children is zero rated whereas clothing for adults is subject to vat at the standard rate of  impactedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may  the theory of the firm shows that taxes on transfers can encourage firms to internalise costs and grow whereas the absence of such transactions may result in a larger number of individually smaller firms for example a sales tax – unlike a vat – would realign the incentives of a steel mill in favor of operating its own coal mine as opposed to simply buying coal in a transaction subject to taxation the theory of the firms model suggests that this would be less economically efficient as it results in a decline in
