blogsalesmanagementgurunewsindepthtech librarysubscribe  winner valorem takes a firstin approach by gladys ramaoctober   risk is part and parcel of valorem consultings dna the cofounders of the kansas citybased microsoft consulting partner justin jackson and domnick parretta had a vision of a firstin company  that is a company thats first in adopting and supporting new technology case in point valorem started in  as a firm focused on microsoft cloud technologies at a time when cloud computing was still a largely untested business model and microsoft azure was still in the prerelease stages valorem took a big risk betting its business on cloud and the dividends have been significant in the past six years valorem has grown from a twoperson operation to a personandgrowing company in  revenue grew by  percent year over year in  by  percent and in  by  percent parretta expects revenue to balloon by another  percent this year a big contributor to that growth is valorems willingess to embrace new technologies in  it was cloud nowadays its the internet of things and mixed reality technologies like the microsoft hololens parretta acknowledges that theres inherent risk in valorems firstin philosophy the risk there is where we spend cycles ramping up on the wrong trend he says i dont think weve had one of those big missteps but im sure we will at some point the key to avoiding those missteps so far has been discernment and the ability to distill realworld applications from even the most bleedingedge concepts we do it smartly we dont just jump on everything i think we try to look out for what are the mega trends where is the messaging where is the bubble coming parretta says and we dont do it for the sake of being trendy valorems kansas city headquarters with hololens for instance valorem is taking steps to assess how the technologys d modeling capabilities can augment its own cloud offerings and solve business problems in the manufacturing and design industries parretta doesnt necessarily expect hololens to become a revenue stream for valorem right away at least outside of a handful of early adopters the payoff is in the longterm when the technology has become more mainstream right now the focus is on building the chops among valorems employees to work with mixedreality technologies that way six years from now when it becomes mainstream weve already established ourselves for valorem which offers services based solely on microsoft products this firstin approach also has the benefit of making it easier for the company to get microsofts attention its about getting in early and building rapport and relationships before the herd comes charging in and im a little guy at the table versus the only guy at the table parretta says this relationship with microsoft has been critical to valorems growth according to parretta why valorem won valorems focus on new tech and culture has resulted in fantastic growth the company has proven that it can pick the right technology and the right talent to help its clients with breakthrough results hololens and the cloud represent a huge opportunity for those firms that can harness the power of these tools for their clients i fully expect valorem to be one of those firms  mike harvath ceo revenue rocket consulting group and rcp rocket awards judge another factor in that growth has been the fact that many of valorems stickiest customers have also seen significant revenue growth of their own some of valorems projects that were initially worth between  and  are now worth  to  million according to parretta weve done a good job of profiling and retaining good customers that will grow he says we bet on the right type of projects with the right type of companies as valorems coffers have grown so has its headcount since  yearoveryear employee growth has ranged between  percent and  percent this has been fueled in part by valorems need to diversify its employees skills to keep up with new technology mainly though its a matter of logistics hiring isnt easy but its critical to our ability to sustain growth says parretta who identifies recruitment as valorems top business hurdle of the past three years we spend almost all of our time on how to market how to recruit how to attract the best people because  at least in this day and age  we dont have a sales challenge we can get customers we can retain customers customers want to do work with us we have a challenge in hiring people fast enough the developertojob ratio in kansas city is about to parretta says that makes attracting and retaining employees even more challenging to bolster its recruitment efforts valorem has invested a lot in infusing its headquarters with the kinds of perks that a young workforce has come to expect there are areas to park your cruiser bike for example or socialize over coffee or play ping pong culture is king here parretta says noting that among todays crop of prospective employees high salaries are not always enough someones always going to pay more i think its about culture and about purpose read the full  rcp rocket award winners feature here  back to the rcp rocket
