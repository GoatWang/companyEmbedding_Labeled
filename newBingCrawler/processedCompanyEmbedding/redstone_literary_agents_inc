properly be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the offering per asc s however the company has elected to record and pay the offering expenses as they are incurred the literary publishing industry is intensely competitive and fragmented we will compete against a large number of wellestablished companies with greater product and name recognition and with substantially greater financial marketing and distribution capabilities than ours as well as against a large number of small specialty producers our competitors include by way of example wiley books fitzhenry whiteside simon and schuster and other well known and respected publishers there can be no assurance that we can compete successfully in this complex and changing market if we can not our business will be adversely affected  we will address who is the audience for this book and why they need to buy this book including providing demographic data that reinforces the writers hypothesis we will address the competition list each title that would be in direct competition with the book along with the author publisher and year of publication we will explain why the book would be better or how it fills a vacant niche in the market  getting a literary agent can be the first vital step towards getting published writers who want to become authors are interested in one thing only and that is writing they do not want to worry about how or what is involved in the process that eventually leads to getting their work published and in bookstores for the masses to engage and enjoy we believe also that since we have chosen a niche health and wellness that we can be very focused in our submissions and targeting the right distributorpublisher additionally nonpublished writers have a more difficult time getting the attention of the bigger literary agent as often they already represent an author in the said genre company description redstone literary agents was incorporated in the state of nevada on
