expected the accompanying information contained in this registration statement including without limitation the information set forth under the heading managements discussion and analysis or plan of operation  risk factors identifies important additional factors that could materially adversely affect actual results and performance you are urged to carefully consider these factors all forwardlooking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement overview we are a presently a shell company as defined in rule b of the exchange act whose plan of operation over the next twelve months is to seek and if possible acquire an operating business or valuable assets by entering into a business combination we will not be restricted in our search for business combination candidates to any particular geographical area industry or industry segment and may enter into a combination with a private business engaged in any line of business including service finance mining manufacturing real estate oil and gas distribution transportation medical communications high technology biotechnology or any other managements discretion is as a practical matter unlimited in the selection of a combination candidate management will seek combination candidates in the united states and other countries as available time and resources permit through existing associations and by word of mouth this plan of operation has been adopted in order to attempt to create value for our shareholders for further information on our plan of operation and business see part i item  of our annual report on form k for the year ended  plan of operation we do not intend to do any product research or development we do not expect to buy or sell any real estate plant or equipment except as such a purchase might occur by way of a business combination that is structured as an asset purchase and no such asset purchase currently is anticipated similarly we do not expect to add additional employees or any fulltime employees except as a result of completing a business combination and any such employees likely will be persons already then employed by the company acquired the companys business plan consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets share purchase or exchange merger or similar type of transaction we anticipate no operations unless and until we complete a business combination as described above three months ended september   compared to september   the following table summarizes the results of our operations during the three months ended september   and  respectively and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or decrease from the current month period to the prior month period   percentage line item unaudited unaudited decrease decrease revenues     operating expenses       net loss        loss per share of common stock          we recorded a net loss of  for the three months ended september   as compared with a net loss of  for the three months ended september   nine months ended september   compared to september   the following table summarizes the results of our operations during the nine months ended september   and  respectively and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage

share of common stock          we recorded a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   as compared with a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   liquidity and capital resources we had  cash on hand at september   and had no other assets to meet ongoing expenses or debts that may accumulate since inception we have accumulated a deficit of  as of september   we had total liabilities and a negative working capital of  we have no commitment for any capital expenditure and foresee none however we will incur routine fees and expenses incident to our reporting duties as a public company and we will incur expenses in finding and investigating possible acquisitions and other fees and expenses in the event we make an acquisition or attempt but are unable to complete an acquisition our cash requirements for the next twelve months are principally for accounting expenses and other expenses related to making filings required under the securities exchange act of  which should not exceed  in the fiscal year ending december   any travel lodging or other expenses which may arise related to finding investigating and attempting to complete a combination with one or more potential acquisitions could also amount to thousands of dollars we will only be able to pay our future obligations and meet operating expenses by raising additional funds acquiring a profitable company or otherwise generating positive cash flow as a practical matter we are unlikely to generate positive cash flow by any means other than acquiring a company with such cash flow we believe that management members or shareholders will loan funds to us as needed for operations prior to completion of an acquisition management and the shareholders are not obligated to provide funds to us however and it is not certain they will always want or be financially able to do so our shareholders and management members who advance money to us to cover operating expenses will expect to be reimbursed either by us or by the company acquired prior to or at the time of completing a combination we have no intention of borrowing money to reimburse or pay salaries to any of our officers directors or shareholders or their affiliates there currently are no plans to sell additional securities to raise capital although sales of securities may be necessary to obtain needed funds our current management has agreed to continue their services to us and to accrue sums owed them for services and expenses and expect payment reimbursement only should existing management or shareholders refuse to advance needed funds however we would be forced to turn to outside parties to either loan money to us or buy our securities there is no assurance whatever that we will be able at need to raise necessary funds from outside sources such a lack of funds could result in severe consequences to us including among others  failure to make timely filings with the sec as required by the exchange act which also probably would result in suspension of trading or quotation in our stock and could result in fines and penalties to us under the exchange act  curtailing or eliminating our ability to locate and perform suitable investigations of potential acquisitions or  inability to complete a desirable acquisition due to lack of funds to pay legal and accounting fees and acquisitionrelated expenses we hope to require potential candidate companies to deposit funds with us that we can use to defray professional fees and travel lodging and other due diligence expenses incurred by our management related to finding and investigating a candidate company and negotiating and consummating a business combination there is no assurance that any potential candidate will agree to make such a deposit going concern our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit issued in connection with the financial statements for the period ended december   relative to our ability to continue as a going concern we had  negative working capital as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of  incurred through september   and recorded a loss of  for the third quarter of  and a loss of  from operations for the fiscal year ended december  t he going concern opinion issued by our auditors means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for month period ending december   and thereafter the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues

to the interim financial statements september   unaudited    organization and basis of presentation   yacht finders inc the “company” was incorporated in delaware on november   as sneeoosh corporation on october   the company filed an amended certificate of incorporation to change the name to snohomish corporation the company did not conduct any operations until april   the date the company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to yacht finders inc yacht finder’s inc business plan was to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface immediately with each other while capturing the benefits of targeting a larger market on november   the company discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan the company’s business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets share purchase or exchange merger or similar type of transaction   the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for annual financial statements in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included operating results for the three and nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending december   for further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the form k for the year ended december      summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   loss per common share   the company reports loss per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted loss per share basic loss per share excludes the impact of common stock equivalents and is determined by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock at september   there were no variances between the basic and diluted loss per share as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company generated a net loss of  for the threemonth period ended september   and has a stockholders’ deficit of  as of september   these conditions among others raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on working capital advances being provided by the company’s majority shareholder for its ability to meet its obligations to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty there is no assurance that the working capital advances will continue in the future nor that company will be successful in raising additional funds through other sources               yacht finders inc   notes to the interim financial statements september   unaudited    summary of significant accounting policies con’t   new accounting pronouncements   from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the company’s accounting and reporting the company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position results of operations and cash flows when implemented    related party transactions   at september   the company had loans and notes outstanding from a shareholder in the aggregate amount of  which bears interest at  per annum and represents amounts loaned to the company to pay the company’s operating expenses on december   the payee under the note and the company

business engaged in any line of business including service finance mining manufacturing real estate oil and gas distribution transportation medical communications high technology biotechnology or any

statements   part i   item  business   background   yacht finders inc the “company” was incorporated in delaware on august   as sneeoosh corporation on october   the company filed an amended certificate of incorporation to change the name to snohomish corporation on april   the company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to yacht finders inc yacht finder’s inc business plan was to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface immediately with each other while capturing the benefits of targeting a larger market on november   the company discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan the company’s business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets share purchase or exchange merger or similar type of transaction   the company’s current business plan is to seek investigate and if warranted acquire one or more properties or businesses and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value the acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase merger exchange of stock or otherwise and may encompass assets or a business entity such as a corporation joint venture or partnership the company has limited capital and it is unlikely that the company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity the company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of longterm growth as opposed to shortterm earnings   the company’s principal shareholders are in contact with brokerdealers and other persons with whom they are acquainted who are involved in corporate finance matters to advise them of the company’s existence and to determine if any companies or businesses they represent have an interest in considering a merger or acquisition with the company no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity given that limited funds are available for acquisitions or that any acquisition that occurs will be on terms that are favorable to the company or its stockholders                the company’s search is directed toward small and mediumsized enterprises which have a desire to become public corporations and which are able to satisfy or anticipate in the reasonably near future being able to satisfy the minimum asset and other requirements in order to qualify shares for trading on one of the nasdaq markets or a stock exchange see “investigation and selection of business opportunities” the company anticipates that the business opportunities presented to it may i be recently organized with no operating history or a history of losses attributable to undercapitalization or other factors ii be experiencing financial or operating difficulties iii be in need of funds to develop a new product or service or to expand into a new market iv be relying upon an untested product or marketing concept or v have a combination of the characteristics mentioned in i through iv the company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued given the above factors investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have a history of losses or low profitability   the company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry and may therefore engage in essentially any business to the extent of its limited resources this includes industries such as service finance natural resources manufacturing high technology product development medical communications and others the company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted subject to the availability of such opportunities economic conditions and other factors   any entity which has an interest in being acquired by or merging into the company is expected to be an entity that desires to become a public company and establish a public trading market for its securities in connection with such a merger or acquisition it is highly likely that an amount of stock constituting control of the company would be issued by the company or purchased from the current principal shareholders of the company by the acquiring entity or its affiliates if stock is purchased from the current shareholders the transaction is very likely to result in substantial gains to them relative to their purchase price for such stock in the company’s judgment none of its officers and directors would thereby become an “underwriter” within the meaning of the section  of the securities act of  as amended the sale of a controlling interest by certain principal shareholders of the company could occur at a time when the other shareholders of the company remain subject to restrictions on the transfer of their shares   it is anticipated that business opportunities will come to the company’s attention from various sources including its principal shareholders professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants securities brokerdealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals the company has no plans understandings agreements or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for the company   the company does not foresee that it would enter into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which its officers directors or principal shareholders are currently affiliated should the company determine in the future contrary to foregoing expectations that a transaction with an affiliate would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders the company is in general permitted by delaware law to enter into such a transaction if    the material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum or    the material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders or    the contract or transaction is fair as to the company as of the time it is authorized approved or ratified by the board of directors or the stockholders                investigation and selection of business opportunities   to a large extent a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon the principal shareholders’ analysis of the quality of the other company’s management and personnel the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts the merit of technological changes the perceived benefit the company will derive from becoming a publicly held entity and numerous other factors which are difficult if not impossible to analyze through the application of any objective criteria in many instances it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of the possible need to access capital shift marketing approaches substantially expand significantly change product emphasis change or substantially augment management or make other changes the company will be dependent upon the owners of a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement or be primarily responsible for the implementation of required changes because the company may participate in a business opportunity with a newly organized firm or with a firm which is entering a new phase of growth it should be emphasized that the company will incur further risks because management in many instances will not have proved its abilities or effectiveness the eventual market for such company’s products or services will likely not be established and such company may not be profitable when acquired   it is anticipated that the company will not be able to diversify but will essentially be limited to one such venture because of the company’s limited financial resources this lack of diversification will not permit the company to offset potential losses from one business opportunity against profits from another and should be considered an adverse factor affecting any decision to purchase the company’s securities   it is emphasized that the company may affect transactions having a potentially adverse impact upon the company’s shareholders pursuant to the authority and discretion of the company’s management and board of directors to complete acquisitions without submitting any proposal to the stockholders for their consideration holders of the company’s securities should not anticipate that the company will necessarily furnish such holders prior to any merger or acquisition with financial statements or any other documentation concerning a target company or its business in some instances however the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the stockholders for their consideration either voluntarily by such directors to seek the stockholders’ advice and consent or because state law so requires   the analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the company’s principal shareholders who are not professional business analysts although there are no current plans to do so the company might hire outside consultants to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities and might pay a finder’s fee since the company has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors the services to be provided the term of service or regarding the total amount of fees that may be paid however because of the limited resources of the company it is likely that any such fees the company agrees to pay would be paid in stock and not in cash otherwise the company anticipates that it will consider among other things the following factors    potential for growth and profitability indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products    the company’s perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by the company’s stockholders    whether following the business combination the financial condition of the business opportunity would be or would have a significant prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming sufficient to enable the securities of the company to qualify for listing on an exchange or on a national automated securities quotation system such as nasdaq so as to permit the trading of such securities to be exempt from the requirements of rule c adopted by the securities and exchange commission    capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by the company or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources    the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced                 competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole    strength and diversity of existing management or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment    the cost of participation by the company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potential and    the accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items   in regard to the possibility that the shares of the company would qualify for listing on one of the nasdaq markets the current standards include the requirements that the issuer of the securities satisfy among other requirements certain minimum levels of shareholder equity market value or net income many of the business opportunities that might be potential candidates for a combination with the company would not satisfy any of the nasdaq market listing criteria   not one of the factors described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity and the company will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex potential investors must recognize that because of the company’s limited capital available for investigation the company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired   the company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity the company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing such items as a description of products services and company history management resumes financial information available projections with related assumptions upon which they are based an explanation of proprietary products and services evidence of existing patents trademarks or services marks or rights thereto present and proposed forms of compensation to management a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during relevant periods a description of present and required facilities an analysis of risks and competitive conditions a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements audited financial statements or if they are not available unaudited financial statements together with reasonable assurances that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a reasonable period of time following completion of a merger transaction and other information deemed relevant   as part of the company’s investigation the company’s principal shareholders may meet personally with management and key personnel may visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided check references of management and key personnel and take other reasonable investigative measures to the extent of the company’s limited financial resources   it is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the company could be limited by the impact of securities and exchange commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of “penny stocks” the regulations would affect and possibly impair any market that might develop in the company’s securities until such time as they qualify for listing on nasdaq or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the “penny stock” regulations                the company believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the company to be attractive these include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current shareholders acquisition candidates which have longterm plans for raising capital through the public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process acquisition candidates who have a need for an immediate cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the company to be an attractive alternative   there are no loan arrangements or arrangements for any financing whatsoever relating to any business opportunities currently available   form of acquisition   it is impossible to predict the manner in which the company may participate in a business opportunity specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the company and the promoters of the opportunity and upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the company and such promoters the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected such structure may include but is not limited to leases purchase and sale agreements licenses joint ventures and other contractual arrangements the company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership corporation or other form of organization implementing such structure may require the merger consolidation or reorganization of the company with other corporations or forms of business organization and although it is likely there is no assurance that the company would be the surviving entity in addition the present management board of directors and stockholders of the company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the company following a reorganization transaction as part of such a transaction the company’s existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders   it is likely that the company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the company although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a socalled “tax free” reorganization under the internal revenue code of  depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest ie  or more of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization if a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the internal revenue code the company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate  or less of the total issued and outstanding shares this could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the company prior to such reorganization any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the company by the principal shareholders   it is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions if any are available from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws in some circumstances however as a negotiated element of the transaction the company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter the issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market   the company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto specify certain events of default detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed set forth remedies upon default and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type                as a general matter the company anticipates that it andor its officers and principal shareholders will enter into a letter of intent with the management principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to signing a binding agreement such letter of intent will set forth the terms of the proposed acquisition but will generally not bind any of the parties to consummate the transaction execution of a letter of intent will by no means indicate that consummation of an acquisition is probable neither the company nor any of the other parties to the letter of intent will be bound to consummate the acquisition unless and until a definitive agreement concerning the acquisition as described in the preceding paragraph is executed even after a definitive agreement is executed it is possible that the acquisition would not be consummated should any party elect to exercise any right provided in the agreement to terminate it on specified grounds   it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable moreover because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided the inability of the company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure such goods and services   in all probability upon completion of an acquisition or merger there will be a change in control through issuance of substantially more shares of common stock further in conjunction with an acquisition or merger it is likely that the principal shareholders may offer to sell a controlling interest at a price not relative to or reflective of a price which could be achieved by individual shareholders at the time   investment company act and other regulation   the company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing trading or selling the securities of such business the company does not however intend to engage primarily in such activities specifically the company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an “investment company” under the investment company act of  the “investment act” and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the investment act and the regulations promulgated thereunder   section a of the investment act contains the definition of an “investment company” and it excludes any entity that does not engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities or that does not engage in the business of investing owning holding or trading “investment securities” defined as “all securities other than government securities or securities of majorityowned subsidiaries” the value of which exceeds  of the value of its total assets excluding government securities cash or cash items the company intends to implement its business plan in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception from the definition of “investment company” consequently the company’s participation in a business or opportunity through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited   the company’s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure management control and business especially if it consummates a reorganization as discussed above each of these areas is regulated by the investment act in order to protect purchasers of investment company securities since the company will not register as an investment company stockholders will not be afforded these protections   any securities which the company might acquire in exchange for its common stock are expected to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of the securities act of  as amended the “act” if the company elects to resell such securities such sale cannot proceed unless a registration statement has been declared effective by the u s securities and exchange commission or an exemption from registration is available section  of the act which exempts sales of securities not involving a distribution would in all likelihood be available to permit a private sale although the plan of operation does not contemplate resale of securities acquired if such a sale were to be necessary the company would be required to comply with the provisions of the act to affect such resale   an acquisition made by the company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal state or local authorities compliance with such regulations can be expected to be a timeconsuming and expensive process                competition   the company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive opportunities primarily from business development companies venture capital partnerships and corporations venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies small investment companies and wealthy individuals many of these entities will have significantly greater experience resources and managerial capabilities than the company and will therefore be in a better position than the company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities   employees   as of december   the company

the united states effective december   the company elected to early adopt accounting standards update no  development stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements the adoption of this asu allows the company to remove the inception to date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of topic    use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition   the company has not recognized any revenues from its operations   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents   loss per common share   the company reports loss per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted loss per share basic loss per share excludes the impact of common stock equivalents and is determined by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock at december   and december   there were no variances between the basic and diluted loss per share as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” asc “accounting for income taxes” asc requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse                yacht finders inc notes to financial statements    summary of significant accounting policies con’t   in addition asc seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions the company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax return in california as “major” tax jurisdictions as defined the company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flow therefore no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to asc   fair value measurements   the company adopted the provisions of asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements   the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including payables to related parties and accrued liabilities are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable   level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions   new accounting pronouncements   from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the company’s accounting and reporting the company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position results of operations and cash flows when implemented                yacht finders inc notes to financial statements    summary of significant accounting policies con’t   recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements   in june  the fasb issued asu no  development stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation  to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities the amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from us gaap for development stage entities thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information the amendments in this update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in topic  consolidation for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk the amendments to eliminate that exception simplify us gaap by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities the elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis consolidation decision and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage the amendments related to the elimination of inceptiontodate information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of topic  should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to topic  which shall be applied prospectively the company has elected early adoption of this asu   in august  the fasb issued accounting standard update no  presentation of financial statements—going concern subtopic  asu no  which requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically asu  provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued it also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated asu no  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   and early application is permitted    going

since inception as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of  these conditions among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty the company intends to seek additional working capital advances from the company’s majority shareholder

operating loss carryovers “nols” which begin to expire in  utilization of the nols may be subject to limitation under the internal revenue code section  should there be a greater than  ownership change as determined under regulations   in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based on the assessment management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to nols for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the exchange act that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedure include without limitations controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   in accordance with exchange act rules a and d an evaluation was completed by the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based on that evaluation the company’s sole officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that   ● pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company     ● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and     ● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk                as of december   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the year ended december     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items  and  above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the sec that permit us to provide only the management’s report in this annual report   management’s remediation initiatives   given the financial resources available to the company the company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls as such time as the company commences operations and has the financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses we intend to create take action to do so unfortunately until the company has such financial resources the identified weaknesses will continue to exist   changes in internal control over financial reporting  during the last quarter of the company’s fiscal year ended december   there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of controls  a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within a company have been detected   item b other information   none                part iii   item  directors

director fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and who would be willing to act as an audit committee financial expert as our business expands and as we

controller or persons serving similar functions they would become subject to the code of ethics the code of ethics does not indicate the consequences of a breach of the code if there is a breach the board of directors would review the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach and take action that it deems appropriate which action may include dismissal of the employee who breached the code currently since mr colligan serves as the sole director and sole officer he is responsible for reviewing his own conduct under the code of ethics and determining what action to take in the event of his own breach of the code of ethics   item  executive compensation   no past officer or director of the company has received any compensation and none is due or payable our sole current officer and
