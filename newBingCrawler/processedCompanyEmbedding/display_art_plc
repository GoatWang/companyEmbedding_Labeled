controller designed for driving all kind of common anode led displays and single leds these  products are very easy to use simple and flexible in design providing low count of cables  low consumption low cost light weight and small in dimensions this led controller is suitable for wide range of applications led controller provides all refresh cycles and logic operations light intensity control global intensity using programmable pwm control power supply for logic power anode drivers and serial channel buffers  led drivers led controller drive two independent lines refresh rate is  hz and provide excellent free flicker views of the designed led display duty cycle of refresh is  to  providing maximal possible light intensity for driving dynamic led displays simple and cheap external serial driver blocks  led drivers provides high current for driving leds and low count of cables and interconnections between pcb boards low power consumption and heat losses of the custom designed led displays internal download  upload character generator takes ability of the user to dump directly decimal and hexadecimal values for  segment displays and ascii characters and strings for   segment indicators without one byte additional software led controllers provides additional useful information about level of power supply voltage vin logic supply voltage vcc and room luminosity value for optimal pwm adjusting led controller accepts two types of data hexadecimal and ascii strings and characters first type is decimalhexadecimal bytes and blocks for transmitting commands and driving seven segment displays  second type of data is ascii characters and strings for driving   alphanumeric segment indicators after the command is completed led controller sends to host message selectable as literal or hex for result of operation and indicate that is ready to accept new command simple and low count of command set is very easy to learn and use  by this way can be designed variety of graphic symbols and pictures to the led display mcax is multifunctional led display controller supports three types of interfaces using wedge type  interface boards depending of specific application this interface boards dramatically expand connection flexibility and amount of driven leds as example when is used cb interface board can be connected to single serial channel  up to  slave led controllers mcax that can drive total amount of  single leds each type of interface board is recognizing automatically from led controller and initialize peripherals requirements mcax uses same command set lincluding one extra command for slave select applicable only with cb board         mcax led controller   cb interface board   cb interface board   cb interface board   interface
