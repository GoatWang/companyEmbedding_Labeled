 to a range of  oil demand remains high encouraging oil retailers to run promotional campaigns to attract motorists thai retail oil demand has seen doubledigit growth over the past few years thanks partly to massive sales campaigns from major oil retailers including mileage cards and lucky draws some retailers renovated their petrol stations to offer extra services to motorists such as more

amounts of capital to renovate their petrol stations and launch nonoil services and goods in the stations setlisted oil retailer susco plc whose traditional clients were large vehicles buses and trucks changed gears to focus on personal vehicles starting the susco smart member campaign using mileage cards the mileage is verified by the clients mobile numbers eliminating the need to present a card we are targeting a new generation who hold a lot of cards for several purposes and they can sometimes forget or lose a card our phone number verification simplifies the process said susco
