structure of polylacticcoglycolic acid x number of units of lactic acid y number of units of glycolic acid plga or polylacticcoglycolic acid is a copolymer which is used in a host of food and drug administration fda approved therapeutic devices owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility plga is synthesized by means of ringopening copolymerization of two different monomers the cyclic dimers dioxanediones of glycolic acid and lactic acid polymers can be synthesized as either random or block copolymers thereby imparting additional polymer properties common catalysts used in the preparation of this polymer include tinii ethylhexanoate tinii alkoxides or aluminum isopropoxide during polymerization successive monomeric units of glycolic or lactic acid are linked together in plga by ester linkages thus yielding a linear aliphatic polyester as a product depending on the ratio of lactide to glycolide used for the polymerization different forms of plga can be obtained these are usually identified in regard to the molar ratio of the monomers used eg plga  identifies a copolymer whose composition is  lactic acid and  glycolic acid the crystallinity of plgas will vary from fully amorphous to fully crystalline depending on block structure and molar ratio plgas typically show a glass transition temperature in the range of  °c plga can be dissolved by a wide range of solvents depending on composition higher lactide polymers can be dissolved using chlorinated solvents whereas higher glycolide materials will require the use of fluorinated solvents such as hfip plga degrades by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in the presence of water it has been shown that the time required for degradation of plga is related to the monomers ratio used in production the higher the content of glycolide units the lower the time required for degradation as compared to predominantly lactide materials an exception to this rule is the copolymer with  monomers ratio which exhibits the faster degradation about two months in addition polymers that are endcapped with esters as opposed to the free carboxylic acid demonstrate longer degradation halflives plga has been successful as a biodegradable polymer because it undergoes hydrolysis in the body to produce the original monomers lactic acid and glycolic acid these two monomers under normal physiological conditions are byproducts of various metabolic pathways in the body since the body effectively deals with the two monomers there is minimal systemic toxicity associated with using plga for drug delivery or biomaterial applications also the possibility to tailor the polymer degradation time by altering the ratio of the monomers used during synthesis has made plga a common choice in the production of a variety of biomedical devices such as grafts sutures implants prosthetic devices surgical sealant films micro and nanoparticles specific examples of use include successful in the delivery of amoxicillin for the treatment listeriosis treatment of listeria monocytogenes infection a commercially available drug delivery device using plga is lupron depot for the treatment of advanced prostate
