manufacturing and prototyping a product by mark hayes how to start a business dec    minute read  comments email pinterest facebook facebook linkedin tim ferriss is no stranger to manufacturing and prototyping products before he started writing books ferriss built companies one of his first ventures brainquicken took two weeks and  to launch this sports nutrition ecommerce store quickly grew to  a month business we asked ferriss for his best advice on how to prototype and manufacture a product heres what he had to say  tips on manufacturing a product  think outside of google google is great for finding manufacturers but it shouldnt be your only source also check out trade magazines and find trade shows that are dedicated to the industry youre getting into at trade shows youll find all the reputable manufacturers and distributors under one roof also check out the well known alibaba and thomasnet thomas register of manufacturers  submit lots of proposals once you find a bunch of manufacturers put out a proposal to all of them let them know youre contacting all the others now chances are you dont be able to impress them with the amount of capital you have to invest in a first run so its important to tell them your marketing and business plan include how much volume youll be capable to bring to the table if the first run is a success read the  immutable laws of marketing to help you with your pitch  hunt down the scams and fraudsters do your due diligence take the manufacturers name and research their reputation try typing their name into google with fraud and scam after it to see if anything pops up do the same with the principals of the business find out who the lead executives are and search their names with lawsuit and ftc after their name  dont judge a book by the cover manufacturer websites are notoriously poorly designed but that doesnt necessarily reflect the quality of the company or the products  tips on prototyping a product  define what type of prototype you need its vitally important to determine the objective of your prototype  is it for you to assess the manufacturing is it to sell perspective clients is it to test or sell on kickstarter  dont spend too much money one of tims friends has made millions of dollars selling various licenses he didnt spend tons of money to develop beautiful prototypes in fact most of them were made from paper and cardboard   hire a firm use d printing if you require a more professional or intricate prototype find an industrial design firm in your city theyll put something together and using a d printer will develop a prototype for you or  even use your own d printer like the makerbot thats pictured above  manufacture in small batches only manufacture in small batches until you have proven you can fill the demand and acquire customers profitably you dont want to end up with inventory you cant move also keep in mind that most people tweak their product and its packaging along the way its important to be able to pivot and change without having to throw out a whole bunch of units  email address password your store name create your store join  entrepreneurs who already have a head start

concise points under the video this post should be on the front page of kickstarter andrew e february   pm all very good tips on manufacturing and prototyping your physical product i find these days the step of d printing a prototype is almost a must – simply the best way to get your concept into your hands and test the fit form and appearance – even if it’s not totally fullfunctioning also i think having a design on your side can always help yes it is expensive if they run through the entire process for you but if you already have your concept scratched down on a napkin then for them to convert to a d model for printing is not very expensive it’s even cheaper if you can find an engineeringdesign student or virtual contractor ie on odesk i’ve successfully worked with a number of contractors on there i also agree with smallbatch manufacturing to start – instead of immediately spending thousands of dollars on plastic injection or diecast molds in china have a domestic manufacturer or machine shop make the first hundred units for you you may not actually profit much at this time buu you keep your upfront costs low and you build relationships for future prototyping and manufacturing plus it’s always nice to attempt to make domestic manufacture viable thanks andrew e producracycom suhana april   am hi today i came across this amazing new website named nupinchcom…i really think you guys should check it out link httpbitlyxczfi jamie braddock may   am i am currently setting up a business and i found this article incredibly interesting and helpful on another note if anyone reading this article is interested in discussing my idea with me then please feel free to contact me at jambraddockgmailcom my business is now at the prototypemanufacturing stage and would appreciate any investment enquiriesadvice patricia horn dinkins november   am thank you for the outline i have been holding on to my ideas and have made small quantities to sell when i came up with the bright idea of possibly having my product manufactured your advice gives me more information that allows me to move forward thanks again mike s january   am thank for the advice it’s very helpful and informative i have applied for my international pct and have been published… so i am ready to look into the prototype and manufacturing stage also i am looking for investors and help with moving forward… if anyone is interested in discussing my idea and business with me please email me at mikesylogmailcom and please put helpsylo in the subject thank for the info and the video and the advice and leads bob strong february   pm i remember when i first started my business  years ago unfortunately the company is not here today but prototyping the product was one of the most difficult parts at the beginning after the product was ready it was much easier to market and receive support httpwwwnwpaperboxcompageid jackson leavitt april   pm whenever i thought of prototypes i always imagined drawings of different products i didn’t think that people tried to make them until the prototype was completely finished now that i think about it it would make more sense to make different versions of the product until you found the one that works the best httpwwwrdselectriccomindustrialelectricphp carmen g may   pm i am reinventing a product or rather changing the use of a current product that is already well known in the sewing fabrics and arts and crafts industry would that product that is well known for its current use be a valid prototype for my own product in other words can i present the current product as it is today to manufacturers and just say that i’d like to recondition its current use to the one i have in mind i don’t want to reinvent the wheel if it’s already half way there lynwood sims may   am lot of sales coming in need to make the mobile wing flex com faster it’s a workout device using resistance tubing the best workout device on the planet  need a manufactory to help making it myself right now  kelvin august   pm i have a product in mind that i already have a image of that everyone who has a home can benefit from having one or two of these i am not one who have a lot of money but i have a great product that need to be on the market and i am sure it will make someone and myself very wealthy kevin august   am i know about the difficulties in the relationship myself with chinese suppliers i am british myself married with a chinese girl here in ningbo china i’m part of an international trading company which helps people interested in this article in helping them find suppliers i have made several connections with manufacturers especially with stationery and cleaning products etc if you are interested in importing such products from china don’t hesitate to contact me kevinwhotmailcouk james august   am good advice i actually build and design prototypes for individuals as well as companies i find most are looking for a finished product in the prototype stage the prototype stage is import and you should not just pay big dollars to get a final product made without testing it is best to start with a less expensive and flexible design because you will “tweek” your product as it develops into a final design for the consumer james yimpercom nate g august   am i have an idea for a product that can be used globally and the market for it is vast  i’m talking instant millionaire  i’m doing my research and the  main issues facing me are patents and prototyping the product will sell itself if anyone is
