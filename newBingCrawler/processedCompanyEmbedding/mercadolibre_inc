which it derives more than  of its total revenue as of the end of  the following table shows total revenue and the percentage derived from brazil over the past five years meli revenue      total revenue      revenue  brazil      brazil percent of total      the country also makes up  of the companys profit before allocation of indirect costs as indicated in the segment information of its annual report these factors punctuate the importance of brazil to the growth prospects of mercadolibre indeed the growing presence of connected consumers makes the country an attractive destination consider that internet penetration totals just  in latin america a much lower share than the  in the us and also consider that ecommerce as a percentage of total retail sales reaches only  in brazil in this context the potential of this untapped market comes into clearer focus whats more is that morningstar estimates that  million new internet users in latin america will come online within the next five years a  increase from the current total of  million brazil in particular is expected to grow ecommerce sales from  billion in  to  billion in  a cumulative annual growth rate of  supporting this growth will be an increase in the population of online shoppers from  million in  to  million in  according to forrester research in the shadow of the mighty amazon such figures create an opportunity but also a glaring vulnerability for the company as its brazilian market is quickly growing beyond the niche status of the other geographies where mercadolibre dominates ecommerce the vulnerability exists because of the increasing attractiveness of the market to new competitors numerous commentators have noted that the inevitable entrance by amazoncom nasdaqamzn will spell the death of mercadolibres successful stock run barrons featured this impending risk in an article in may  similar sentiments were quick to be shared on seeking alpha as well the strength of amazon is well known and not something to be overlooked by shareholders of mercadolibre but thus far any such challenges from amazon have been relatively muted a quick visit to the amazoncombr website highlights the meager product offerings of the american ecommerce titan in that region where only the kindle physical and digital books and some apps are listed for sale brazil  wwwamazoncombr usa  wwwamazoncom the expectations for amazon to take over the country from which it derives its name and to lay waste to all competition have not yet come to fruition so whats tamed this vicious predator there are significant challenges for international ecommerce companies entering brazil challenges which directly undermine some of the key competitive advantages amazon holds in the us distribution capabilities and pricing investors business daily has noted higher labor costs and a lack of transportation infrastructure among the problems with only  of all roads paved exportgov reports that brazil has some of the highest logistics costs in the world and numerous sources have noted the onerous brazilian tariffs which can make competitive pricing more of a challenge so while amazon has made an entrance into the brazilian market its physical infrastructure is not yet solidly in place to duplicate its north american segments warehousing capabilities and overall efficiency which make for fast deliveries low pricing and a wide network of happy customers while amazon delays by venturing timidly into the brazilian fray its competition is making strides to capture market share prior to its arrival alibabas nysebaba aliexpress has taken initiative to become one of the most highly frequented international websites bloomberg chalks up the popularity of chinese sites among brazilians to cost advantages even after allowing for high import taxes likewise mercadolibre is using the opportunity to expand its network of consumers and sellers with a chance to fortify its brand recognition and customer loyalty while also driving its growth rate to levels never before seen in the region explosive growth stepping back from brazil for a brief moment mercadolibres companywide growth reaccelerated in  after currency woes constrained reported revenue in  and  since  however the company has grown revenue at  or more every single year and frequently exceeded  growth in registered users has consistently been  or above while growth in total units sold in the marketplace reached  in  the graph below displays the trend in key growth metrics of revenue and units sold over the last seven years both of which are at or near their highest growth rates since  now looking at brazil in particular some have noted the remarkable nature of mercadolibres growth surge in the past  months given the economic turmoil its experiencing in brazil and other key markets while this is a worthwhile note there may be a lessthanintuitive explanation for whats happening behind the scenes in fact morningstar analyst rj hottovy may even turn this notion on its head with his understanding that recessions and economic downturns can often be a springboard for ecommerce adoption hottovy refers to the  and  time frame for amazon as being a key period in the growth of its user base as more consumers gravitate towards ecommerce players during these periods of economic hardship as they look for greater value and convenience hottovy cites this observation to argue that this is how we might expect to see online commerce evolve in other geographic regions perhaps these insights help to explain the explosive revenue growth experienced by mercadolibre of  in brazil in  even as gdp declined  as illustrated below the chart also indicates slower growth during a period of declining gdp in  although currency exchange plays a big role as constant currency revenue growth has been steadily solid in both years but whether brazilian consumers are searching for value and convenience amid trying economic times or merely participating in the continued growth in internet penetration and ecommerce acceptance they are finding mercadolibre in everincreasing numbers and the company and its shareholders stand to benefit as a result valuing explosive growth whats the value of this explosive growth by building a model using earnings growth valuation and time horizon assumptions investors can develop expectations for future performance by mercadolibre morningstar zacks and yahoo finance show that analysts expect fiveyear earnings growth for the company to range between  and  per year using these numbers for the next five years and projecting a future earnings multiple the possible annualized return for meli stock over this period is modeled in the chart below meli fiveyear projected annualized return what constrains these return projections is the current high valuation of meli stock at  times trailing earnings of  per share its clear from the chart above that investors in meli stock must rely on some combination of higher earnings growth and premium future valuation to justify a longterm investment thesis in meli stock any failure by the company to achieve these optimistic targets would leave shareholders exposed to substantial downside risk in the near term if the stock is repriced to reflect diminished growth expectations however as the time horizon increases the prospects become much more favorable as indicated in the chart below which uses the same earnings growth and valuation assumptions but stretches the investment holding period to  years meli year projected annualized return the year chart shows how powerful longterm outsized growth can be although such growth can be very fleeting the rare companies able to achieve it can reward their shareholders greatly if mercadolibre can stretch the  growth that analysts expect in the coming five years to a period of  years or more annualized shareholder returns will likely be in the  to  range so with all of those possibilities in mind what is a price that would make meli stock a bargain for new investors today initiation price target to answer that question its necessary to determine what one expects the company to do over a longerterm investment time horizon different investors will certainly come down on different sides of the issue some may expect amazon and alibaba to outperform mercadolibre in its largest market of brazil and leave it to gradually fade away into anonymity others may expect mercadolibre to maintain an edge against these rivals even if amazon makes a stronger push into brazil and builds capabilities more like those it possesses in the us market still others may view the market as large enough to support multiple successful competitors in an outcome that isnt winner take all while an exact price cant be pinpointed it is possible to determine a range of values depending on the growth expectations and required return for an investor the table below displays the price an investor should consider paying for meli stock in order to achieve a  annualized return over a five or year period depending on their expected time horizon fiveyear period year period initiation price target     premium discount to current price     assumptions annual earnings growth rate     ending priceearnings ratio     target annualized return     the future for mercadolibre while mercadolibre shares may be a great investment even at these elevated levels the company could well face a growth scare or intensified competition at some point which will affect market sentiment and its valuation which could lead to a better buying opportunity in the future even so anyone who subscribes to the expectation for outsized earnings growth in the range of  over the next five years or  in the next  years will find the stock to be fairly valued at its current price today though with very little margin of safety while i was eager to recommend the shares  months ago shareholders considering any new commitments should first make themselves well aware of the associated risks of investing in a highlyvalued fastgrowing company in turbulent markets and with the threat of robust new competition on the horizon in any case mercadolibre remains a highperforming growth stock in an exciting industry and in a market that is far from maturity if you are a shareholder or interested observer feel free to drop a line in the comments section about your expectations for the future of mercadolibre how do you foresee the ecommerce
