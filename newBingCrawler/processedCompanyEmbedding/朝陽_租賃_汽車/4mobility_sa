osoba jest niezwykle uprz⋯⋯ejma i kompetentna  stosunek jakośćcena  czyste nowe auta i dobre stawki głównie dzięki promocji druga godzinadoba za jeden grosz wychodzi dużo taniej od taxi i odrobinę od ubera  lokalizacja na centralnym  często po drodze na minus  fleetster  jedna zła platforma a tyle problemów  ciężko sprawdzić gdzie jest samochódbaza brak mapki tylko adresy  prawdopodobnie techniczny brak możliwości wprowadzenia opcji stopover i freeflow samochodów czyli tego co w carsharingu najfajniejsze  kłopoty w przedłużaniu rezerwacji  brak opcji zmiany karty w apcehistorii przejazdów  syf w informacji o uszkodzeniach auta  ciężko się połapać co było zgłoszone a co nie więc rzeczy są na wszelki wypadek zgłaszane parę razy  przypisane samochodu do bazy przez co po wynajmie pracownik jedzie i odstawia auto  gdyby tego nie robił może ceny byłyby niższe i zielona strefa była większa bo aktualnie jest za mała mam nadzieję że szybko z niej uciekniecie  brzydki branding szczególnie w bmw  czarne mobility premium i zielone lusterka a z drobnych spraw to fajnie że są ładowarki z opcją szybkiego ładowania i uchwyty  bardzo pomocne no i opłacona spp ogólnie jest ok na pewno będę dalej korzystał marco zydorio · kilka słów o mobility  bardziej to jednak klasyczna wypożyczalnia niż carsharing najbardziej mi chyba brakuje czegoś takiego jak stopover czy nawet ove⋯⋯rnight czyli albo przyjeżdżam gdzieś i auto czeka na mnie jako moje albo przyjeżdżam wieczorem pod dom i jak nikt nie zwinie rezerwacji to z samochodu rano mogę korzystać  rejestracja w miarę sprawnie idzie to raczej plus vide konkurencja  samochody  czyste pachnące do niczego nie można się przyczepić  rzeczy dziwne  aplikacjarezerwacja na początku człowiek nie wie jak się ma zachować z deklaracjami terminów i przebiegów  oddawanie do bazy  taka sytuacja biorę od was bmw spod tesco na gocławiu jeżdżę jeżdżę i jadę po skuter do promenady zostawiam bmw pod promenadą  nikt się ze mną nie kontaktuje że poza strefą samochód potem jeżdżę skuterem i zaczyna padać deszcz więc jadę do tesco biorę mini i jadę pod dom prawie zostawiam na szaserów nikt nie dzwoni do mnie że poza strefą kilka dni później biorę mini z centrum i zostawiam na szaserów zaraz telefon  prośba o oddanie w tesco miły ukłon w stronę klienta  za ten dojazd nie policzono choć można było można też było wziąć  zł za nieczytanie regulaminu p dobrym rozwiązaniem byłby push z aplikacji albo tak jak u konkurencji brak możliwości zdania wirtualnego klucza poza strefąbazą pracujcie pracujcie rozszerzajcie rozszerzajcie strefy dajcie bonusy za zwrot w bazach nie podnoście cen  kilka uwag od starszego kolegi p maciej szlachcic · miałem wystawić ocenę  po dniowym wynajmnie mini one ale właśnie dostałem emaila o poniższej treści w związku z najmem samochodu o numerze rejestracyjny⋯⋯m wi fn rozpoczętym w dn  r o godzinie  informujemy że w związku z odnotowaniem braku elementów wyposażenia lewarka klucza do zabezpieczenia antykradzieżowego kół oraz apteczki wraz zawartością po zakończeniu pana rezerwacji zgodnie z regulaminem na twoim koncie zostaną naliczone opłaty w wysokości równej kosztom części i robocizny zgodnie z normami producenta pojazdu informujemy że zgodnie z regulaminem do zapłaty opłat dodatkowych jesteś zobowiązany niezwłocznie przy użyciu karty płatniczej lub kredytowej zarejestrowanej w systemie mobility płatności żadnej próby kontaktu telefonicznego w celu wyjaśnienia tej sytuacji klient który zostawił w ciągu miesiąca już zł został odgórnie potraktowany jak złodziej albo frajer bo prawdopodobnie te elementy wyposażenia nigdy w samochodzie się nie znalazły przebieg km z czego ja sam zrobiłem km albo pożyczył je ktoś inny lub nawet własny pracownik z samochodu nic nie zniknęło przy moim udziale został zwrócony w takim samym stanie wizualnym i technicznym jak w dniu wynajmu po kontakcie z infolinią i mam na to świadka co więcej w regulaminie ani nigdzie indziej poza apteczką takie elementy wyposażenia nie są wymienione tak więc wypożyczając samochód z mobility możecie się liczyć z nieuzasadnionymi oskarżeniami tego typu zapowiadało się fajnie ale niestety nie polecam  jak dla mnie to próba wyłudzenia i być może skończy się w sądzie  kim trzeba w ogóle być żeby płacąc za wynajem samochodu zł kraść jakiś badziew z samochodu sprawdźcie lepiej czy wam kabel usb żarówki wycieraczki albo płyn do spryskiwaczy nie zginęły jakby w samochodzie były jeszcze mydło albo papier toaletowy to też bym pewnie zabrał żeby mi się wydatek zwrócił ja jestem uczciwy ale niestety to z mobility wyszła cebula marcin panter · testuję rozwiązanie już od jakiegoś czasu i chciałbym podzielić się wrażeniami rejestracja konta nie sprawia problemu oczywiście nie jest to jedno kliknięcie ⋯⋯ale działa to dość sprawnie rezerwacja i wypożyczenie samochodu są dziecinnie proste podajemy miejsce z jakiego chcemy odebrać samochód i godzinę kilometry służą bardziej określeniu wysokości opłaty mylące może być to że z poziomu strony wygląda tak jakby samochód trzeba było zwrócić w tym samym miejscu  nie jest to jednak prawda rozpoczęcie i zakończenie rezerwacji otwieranie zamykanie samochodu z poziomu aplikacji czytelne i proste są jednak pewne braki  wygląda że samochody przypisane są jednak do lokalizacji więc jak wypożyczę samochód i przejadę nim do innej stacji to niestety nie mogę go ponownie wynająć  wygląda że pracownik przyjeżdża i zabiera samochód to oryginalnej stacji  zdecydowanie do poprawy  nie ma możliwości zostawienia samochodu w strefie płatnego parkowania i podjęcia go w tym samym miejscu po jakimś czasie  w niektórych stacjach brak czytelnego oznakowania miejsc do parkowania jak nie ma ochrony człowiek błąka się samochodem po parkingu np przasnyska a rozumiem że na chwilę obecną jest więcej parkingów niż samochodów dlatego w wielu lokalizacjach brak możliwości podjęcia samochodu na szczęście to początki i mam nadzieję że wiele z tych punktów zostanie poprawionych  a ja korzystam nadal  marek krykowski · skorzystałem z usługi dwa razy za pierwszym razem numer telefonu chciałem już dodać do ulubionychxd zaznaczyłem że potrzebuję auta na h na wszelki wypadek⋯⋯ wykonałem fotki przed odbiorem i kontrolnie wysłałem na maila ażeby zaczerpnąć informacji czy jest brudny czy tylko mnie się wydaje ku mojemu przerażeniu wyrok do mycia proszę udać się na stację orlen umyć auto no to ja nawigacja orlen m jadę zajeżdżam na orlen brak myjni telefon orlen z myjnią jest km stąd na obowiązkowe mycie straciłem ok min musiałem zawnioskować o doliczane minuty a gdybym wziął auto na  min i nie mógłbym sobie pozwolić na doliczane minuty bo np miałbym pociąg lub cokolwiek innego czy musiałbym zapłacić karę i na infolinii mogli by zwracać uwagę żeby pamiętać o demontażu anteny z dachu do mycia bo w ferworze walki z czasem mniej ogarnięta osoba mogłaby zapomnieć o tej czynności kwestia no  jak już ktoś pisał brak możliwości podjęcia zwolnionego już auta które stoi w zielonej strefie no słabe po kiego grzyba muszę zaznaczać uszkodzenia jeśli tak czy siak auto zostaje zgarnięte przez pracownika który ocenia jego stan równie dobrze można by w aplikacji dodać wykonaj  zdjęcia auta i można by ułatwić najem auta z poza bazy gdy brałem auto za drugim razem jak zobaczyłem obsraną szybę to chwaliłem pana stwórcę że wymyślił spryskiwacze i wycieraczki ogólnie spoko usługa dla ogarniętych i niestresujących się w stresujących sytuacjach szczególnie kiedy średnie spalanie balansuje na granicy przekroczenia o  spalania miejskiego przy spokojnej jeździe bartek sudomir · bardzo słabo wypadacie podczas promocji mytaxi tam mam  rabatu na cały kurs przy  km przejechanych płacę ok  zł do tego mam kierowcę i bus pas dost⋯⋯ępny w szczycie u was za przejechanie  km  minut w centrum muszę zapłacić  zł za dystans do tego  zł za wypożyczenie na  minut bardzo punkty zwrotu w mało strategicznych miejscach do tego mam na głowie wszystkie usterki i obawy że ktoś może zniszczyć auto a z taxi zero stresu i dotarcie do celu w szybkim czasie póki co mnie nie przekonujecie pod względem finansowym jest bardzo drogo fakt powiecie promocja nie trwa wiecznie na taksówki ale ma być przedłużona aż do końca wakacji więc jeśli reklamujecie się że jesteście alternatywą dla drogich taksówek to niestety ale taksówką wychodzi znacznie taniej o długich dystansach nie wspomnę za dwa dni i przejechanie  km miałbym zapłacić  zł wypożyczalnie aut oferują samochód  zł za dobę więc przy wynajmie na  doby płacę w granicach  zł  paliwo na  km   zł to i tak jest połowa waszego cennika jak dla mnie bardzo drogo każda z opcji przemysław przemek · skorzystałem w weekend pierwszy raz przygoda z mini one super mały ale wariat choć nie katowałem samochodu no może przez krótką chwilę   to wrażenia z ja⋯⋯zdy wygoda innowacja wszystko to na plus nie zrażają mnie małe niedociągnięcia projekt startuje ale ma bardzo duży potencjał trzymam kciuki i następnym razem wezmę clubmana  tak swoją drogą to faktycznie warto sobie przeliczyć czy rzeczywiście posiadanie własnego samochodu jest konieczne jeśli jeździ się  po warszawie i korzysta z usługi car sharingu jedyne czego się obawiam to kwestia eksploatacji samochodów po dłuższym czasie wszyscy wiemy jak po kilku latach wyglądają rowery miejskie ale wierzę że macie pomysł na użytkowników dewastatorów wojciech dymkowski · krótka relacja z wczorajszego wypożyczenia  oczywiście pozytywna  obiekt  bmw ze stacji alken   pierwsze wrażenie bardzo pozytywne ⋯⋯ szybka weryfikacja z aplikacją czy są jakieś uszkodzenia na samochodzie po czym otwieram samochód telefonem  super opcja d w środku pachnie jeszcze nowością  na liczniku km  można powiedzieć że nówka szybkie rozeznanie co gdzie jest i do czego służyodpalamy i w drogę  auto super się prowadzi ustawienie w tryb sport i automat pracuje o wiele szybciej podgrzewane siedzenia dodatkowo podgrzewają emocje z jazdy d w moich rękach auto było przez h i przez ten czas nie mogłem powiedzieć złego słowa na nie po tych wszystkich superlatywach przyszła kolej na malutkie minusy  aplikacja w pewnym momencie stwierdziła że kończy mi się rezerwacja w garażu galerii handlowej ale po chwili odzyskała sprawność i poprawnie wyświetlała pozostały czas wynajmu drugi minusik objawił się przy odprowadzaniu samochodu ten stwierdził na parkingu macierzystym że wystąpiła awaria klucza i aby uruchomić pojazd należy skorzystać z aplikacji lecz samochód nie zgasł i udało mi się zaparkować   być może nastąpił problem komunikacyjny pomiędzy samochodem a centralą mobility na koniec grzecznie wysiadłem obejrzałem samochód ze wszystkich stron razem z aplikacją i z żalem zakończyłem rezerwację i udałem się w drogę powrotną do domu  rozwijajcie się dalej i powiększajcie ofertę d z wielką chęcią skorzystam ponownie  mateusz szklarek · miałem okazje wczoraj testować bmw serii  przede wszystkim łatwość wypożyczenia samochodu nie licząc procesu rejestracji i podpięcia karty płatniczej na duż⋯⋯y plus cały proces wypożyczenia to tak na prawdę kilka kliknięć w aplikacji i samochód zostaje otwarty po wejściu do auta oprócz czystości i tego że auto pachnie jeszcze nowością najbardziej zaskoczyło mnie to że w aucie mamy dostępny mpakiet stylizacyjny to na prawdę świetna sprawa od razu mamy poczucie że jedziemy fajnie wyposażonym autem a nie podstawową wersją jak ma to miejsce w wielu wypożyczalniach możecie poprawić opis zgłaszania usterek ponieważ w aplikacji miałem zaznaczoną usterkę przedniego zderzaka prawdopodobnie przez poprzednią osobe ale niestety nic nie zauważyłem osobiście więc pytanie czy usterka została już usunięta przez was jeśli tak powinno być to zaaktualizowane w aplikacji czy po prostu poprzednia osoba źle zgłosiła dobra byłaby np opcja załączenia zdjęcia do wypełnionego formularza z usterkami wtedy można łatwo sprawdzić co zostało uszkodzone na pewno skorzystam jeszcze nie raz z ciekawości jeszcze jedno pytanie jaki silnik jest w bmw serii  i czy jest on jest przyblokowany elektronicznie piotrek pe · testowalem dzis po raz pierwszy wszystko wyglada na ok lokalizacja dogodna szkoda ze nie moge zostawic samochodu w centrum zakonczyc jazde i ponownie go wy⋯⋯pozyczyc po np  czy  godzinach powinna byc taka mozliwosc ale rozumiem ze to poczatki i usluga bedzie sie rozwijac rozumiem ze jesl jestem przy samochodzie o  a mam rezerwacje na  to musze czekac mimo ze samochod stoi i czeka pewne kwestie nie sa jasne i chyba nie do konca wytlumaczone co do wielu rzeczy musialem pytac sie telefonicznie a wbrew pozorom nie wszystko jest na pierwszy rzut oka tak oczywiste aplikacja dziala ale jest archaiczna jesli chodzi o design i nie do konca jasna pobieranie klucza dla osoby ktora nie wie o co chodzi nie do konca moze byc oczywiste ja obejzalem filmik na youtube z recenzja i dzieki temu wiedzialem jak otworzyc samochod ale sama aplikacja po rezerwacji nie prowadzi za reke i nie mowi co dalej zrobic łukasz sokołowski · wczoraj skorzystałem z usługi po raz pierwszy samochód  bmw   w świetnym stanie dobrze wyposażony czysty kilka spostrzeżeń plusy⋯⋯  rezerwację miałem rozpocząć o  aplikacja nie zrobiła problemu że do auta podszedłem  minut wcześniej byłem w stanie rozpocząć jazdę wcześniej  auto zatankowane do pełna duży plus  spory wybór samochodów na świętokrzyskiej od mini clubman przez bmw  po wspomnianą trójkę  zero problemów z otwarciem samochodu i rozpoczęciem jazdy wszystko bardzo intuicyjnie rozwiązane  za trochę ponad dwie godziny jazdy i km zapłąciłem trochę ponad zł moim zdaniem świetna cena za jakość i wolności od taksiarzy minusy  brak opcji dla ludzi z dziećmi moglibyście podstawić chociaż jeden samochód z fotelikiem a najlepiej dać do użytkowania auta ze zintegrowanym fotelikami w tylnej kanapie  samochód oddałem w stacji na targówku po pierwsze słabo oznaczone  nie jest pod ikeą jak to piszecie na stronie po drugie auto które oddałem nie było dostępne do ponownego wynajmu z tej lokalizacji  proces rejestracji jest tragiczny koniecznie musicie to uprościć  możlwiość rejestracji z poziomu apki to mus  konieczność podpisania umowy u was w biurze jeżeli chcę brać faktury na firmę moglibyście załatwiać to przez kuriera  oddzielna aplikacja do płatności to powinno być zawarte w głównej apce arkadiusz patryk ·  absurdalnie niewygodny proces rejestracji nie dość że niemożliwy w aplikacji tylko via www to jeszcze wymaga trybu desktopowego totalne nieporozumienie⋯⋯  podpięcie karty podobnie jak wyżej z tym jeszcze zastrzeżeniem że musimy się zalogować innym hasłem niż normalnie logując się do aplikacji www  samo sprawdzenie konta po założeniu zajęło jakieś pół godziny za to props  aplikacja w ciągu trwania danej rezerwacji nie jest w stanie mi powiedzieć ile km przejechałem myślę że wyciągnięcie tych danych z systemu nie powinno być ogromnym problemem skoro pracownik mobility dzwonił zwrócić mi uwagę na odrobinę zbyt dynamiczny sposób jazdy i wiedział nawet ile razy dokładnie pedał gazu spotykał podłogę  brak informacji na temat pobranej opłaty w aplikacji info przychodzi jedynie smsem brak historii przejazdów  słabo  niemal wcale nie oznaczone punkty gdzie można samochód zostawić  odebrać często trzeba zgadywać domyślać się etc  punktów póki co moim zdaniem jest zdecydowanie za mało ale są też oczywiście plusy  fajnie wyposażone samochody skrzynie auto nie są to golasy mini one clubman bmw  bmw   koszt paliwa pokrywa mobility  koszt parkowania w płatnej strefie  jw  ww autami bardzo przyjemnie się podróżuje  w wyznaczonej strefie w centrum nie musimy zwracać samochodu do punktu mobility możemy zostawić go gdziekolwiek ogólnie daję mocne  licząc na więcej w niedalekiej przyszłości beata suchocka · właśnie skorzystałam z usługi wypożyczyłam auto na dwie doby wszystko było takjak planowałam czyli zaplanowałam że zrobię około km i kwota za taką trasę ⋯⋯została sciągnięta z konta wszystko sprawnie pięknie radość z jazdy tym bmw  na prawde wielka auta są nowe w super wyposazeniu kontakt z obsługą również szybki i sprawny pomysł na wypożyczenie auta na minuty na pewno się zdecyduje na to nie raz polecam mateusz antolak · dzisiaj po raz pierwszy się przejechałem całkiem ciekawa alternatywa  raz na ruski rok można skorzystać jest jednak małe ale  przydałoby się więcej stacji ⋯⋯z niektórymi potrafią wystąpić problemy zaparkowanie na pl konstytucji nie było możliwe z powodu zajętych wszystkich miejsc parkingowych z kolei zaparkowanie na parkingu przy ul zielnej też nie było możliwe  miejsc wolnych cała masa ale co z tego skoro budka parkingowego pusta na szczęście udało się zaparkować na tyłach centrum przedsiębiorczości przy smolnej michał trzęsimiech · postanowiłem przetestować w ostatni weekend niestety zaczęło się kiepsko bo na iphone ios  nie byłem w stanie pobrać kluczyka i otworzyc samochodu  apli⋯⋯kacja nie zorientowała się że jestem przy samochodzie i że rozpoczęła się już moja rezerwacja na innym telefonie z androidem na szczęście się udało już bezproblemowo kontakt z infolinia bardzo dobry mimo że była to niedziela po południu samochód bmw  nowy w świetnym stanie trochę dziwne że trzeba zakładać dwa konta  jedno do aplikacji a drugie do systemu płatności generalnie wrażenia dobre i mam nadzieję że problemy z ios zostaną rozwiązane  bo bez tego to spora część użytkowników zrezygnuje na wstępie grzegorz górski · pierwszy raz korzystalem z cs przyznam mialem obawy na szczescie nie potrzebnie trzeba przyznac proces rejestracji jest zmudny ale chodzi tu o bezpieczenstw⋯⋯o naszych platnosci sam dostep do samochodu mega fajny

rozbudowanie floty oraz samego projektu bo duzy potencjal w nim drzemie skorzystam z checia ponownie oraz bede zachecal znajomych hanna piekarska · korzystałam kilka razy i z czystym sumieniem mogę polecić każdemu tą opcję samochody są super nie ma z nimi problemów technicznych za to spełniają wszystkie potrzeby przeogromny plus za działającą klimę szczególnie w te upałygrzegorz figurski · kilkukrotnie korzystałem już z wypożyczania pojazdów w mobility samochody fajne pachnące nowością ostatnio wypożyczyłem pojazd w stacji przy metrze imielin i⋯⋯ jakie było moje zdziwienie jak się okazało że samochodu nie było aktualizujcie pozycje samochodów bo w chwili obecnej samochód na stałe jest przypisany do stacji i jak się zwróci go gdzie indziej to można go wynająć z bazy macierzystej arkadiusz seidler · skorzystałem wczoraj z usługi i zdecydowanie polecam  po uprzedniej rejestracji na stronie i w apce samo wynajęcie samochodu jest banalnie proste łatwo znal⋯⋯azłem punkt odbioru i wyruszyłem w drogę samochód bmw aż pachniał nowością dobrze wyposażony bardzo komfortowy parkowanie również bezproblemowe podjechałem do oznaczonej bazy zwrotów samochodów i po prostu zakończyłem rezerwację za pomocą apki za przejazd z żoliborza do mordoru zapłaciłem  zł co uważam za bardzo dobrą stawkę na pewno tańszą niż taxi przy kolejnej okazji na pewno znów skorzystam  jakub kazimierczak · wczoraj skorzystałem pierwszy raz jechałem nowiutkim mini wszystko bardzo sprawnie działało jechało się przyjemnie auto zostawiłem w strefie w śródmieściu ⋯⋯ogólnie super póki co minus to mało stacji i za mała strefa gdzie można zostawić auto oby system rozwijał się szybko szczególnie o stacje pkp np warszawa zachodnia no i pamiętajcie o elektrykach  flota mobilitymobility  car sharing ·
