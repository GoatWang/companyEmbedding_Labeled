antifragilitythe lone wolf investorsummarythe economy is suffering from anemic growth in a time of a tightening fed it is only worsening and harshly affecting the auto sectornew auto loan originations are collapsing and delinquencies are trending up all while used car prices have begun to decline catching many off guard and will only worsen from nowcar rental companies such as avis budget group and hertz command massive fleets of used cars which they depend on for resale income and collateral for debtavis is overwhelmed by creditors and other claimants dangerously so and have razorthin net margins to try and service these loans of which  billion comes due before january avis generated no free cash flow for years and depends on yieldstarved creditors to maintain its business which is capitalintensive and sensitive to a weak economy making it fragile avis budget group nasdaqcar is one of the largest car rental companies in the world i am sure any of you have seen it at airports or used its service if your car broke down i know when i was younger my dads cadillac cts broke down and we went to avis and left in a chrysler  but now that i am in my mids i have a new appreciation for looking at things and after looking more closely at avis i am almost certain the company is dangerously close to insolvency if the economy further weakens a softer economy declining car prices years of negative free cash flow and an overleveraged balance sheet is a fatal combination for car renters avis depends on managing a massive fleet of used cars and their increasing prices have been great for its total assets and collateral base during the last few years we have witnessed a booming auto bubble and rising vehicle prices this greatly benefited avis and its stock price but i believe the tide is turning in fact it already has past the turning point the stocks been pummeled thus far in  but i think it is only the beginning of its descent downwards i now present my short case against avis budget group i aviss asset base is a massive fleet of rental cars thus the bulk of its revenues come from selling used cars so how does avis depend on rising car prices avis and other car rentals buy cars outright from manufacturers or get them on a buyback program the buyback program cars are called program cars and cost more since car companies assume the risk of buying them back later outright purchases are called risk cars because avis is responsible for what it will be able to sell them for at a later date this way it can assume what they will be worth on the market inflating its future asset expectations aviss fleet is made up  program cars and the rest are risk cars avis is trying to attract buyers of cars through its website that offer  discounts i expect these discounts to greatly increase as new and used car prices fall morgan stanley recently published a report on the weakening used car market and i share these expectations its conclusion is grave even if the bull market continues on through  the best case for used car prices will be to remain flat a stagnant market or the base scenario will have losses around  and a bear market or recession prices would plummet over  it appears that after years of used car price strength the cycle is now turning nada used car guide index collapse is concerning to all especially how used car prices have a direct effect on new car prices deutsche bank noted the recent surprise of the  yearoveryear drop during february  rentalcar company bonds are turning into lemons debt issued by hertz global holdings inc nysehtz and avis budget group inc which had traded at or above par in recent years tumbled to new lows earlier this month amid signs that usedvehicle prices are dropping twice as much as expected thats bad news for companies that collectively have to dispose of about  vehicles a year and especially for hertz whose junkrated debt is teetering close to a downgrade  wrote molly smith on bloomberg i expect that aviss bonds wont be far behind hertzs junk rating this severe drop in used car prices will lead to huge writedowns of aviss capital assets it also means less money the company will make when it sells the cars from its fleet it had a paltry  net margin during the good years which is extremely slim if avis had weak margins and a mounting pile of debt during the car bubble years and post recovery imagine how bad things will get during a slowdown during the years of rising car prices avis was able to hold on to its fleet vehicles longer giving them better margins for resale but now falling car prices mean the opposite during the chaos of  aviss stock fell all the way to  cents this is important because such low margin capital intensive and highly leveraged businesses are very sensitive to financial market and economic changes ii taking a closer look at aviss capital structure how would a softer economy and declining used car prices affect its business now observing how aviss debt to equity has deteriorated is cringeworthy not that it was in particularly any good position two years ago but now it has over  billion in debt sitting on top of a miniscule sliver of  million in equity that is less than  other than its debt aviss total liabilities are truly breathtaking and as of june  roughly  billion of total liabilities is balancing on top of  million in total shareholder equity in other words less than  of aviss business is funded by shareholders and the other  that comes from creditors and other claimants and this is all against a total asset base that is depending on used car prices to perform such extreme leverage leaves the company highly vulnerable to even the slightest external or internal shock if the remaining  million equity is wiped out that doesnt necessarily mean the company will cease to operate while a red flag negative equity companies can operate total liabilities overweight total assets but they need cash flow to meet their liabilities coming due if the cash flow is inadequate the company will end up ruined how is the earning power of avis here are the last  quarters it is as i thought during the booming car bubble years it had beaten its wall street estimate with strong earnings but during the last five quarters avis has missed its estimates  times the latest quarter may  being a wild miss and i expect this trend to continue as car prices sink and the economy contracts still dont be fooled by aviss ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and eps earnings per share these are almost meaningless for shareholders because all of what they make from ebitda goes back into simply maintaining its business and huge rental fleet what truly matters to investors is free cash flow this is the means for a company to pay dividends buy shares back and grow the company along with shareholder value but avis makes  free cash flow therefore it never has any free cash flow yearoveryear growth and for longterm ebitda not to generate any positive free cash flow is troubling the overwhelmingly leveraged balance sheet explains how its business has been maintained through debt only without any generous creditors avis would be on life support if not dead iii if it wasnt for central bankers led by the fed engaging in zirp zero interest rate policies and qe quantitative easing i dont believe avis would have been able to get so deep in debt but as investors and lenders were starved for yield they make more risky loans which gave avis all the cheap funding it needed to maintain this house of cards all those investors and creditors that are gobbling up these juicy yields from abs auto backed securities need to simply only remember a decade ago recall how the mbs mortgage backed securities market got slaughtered when home prices began falling autobacked securities are a huge source of funding in the auto market without them the  trillion auto loan bubble will lose steam and i am afraid it already it has i expect investors and creditors to have growing concerns about the auto sector which includes rental car companies with used car prices falling aviss creditors should question the value of its collateral the fleet of its rental cars not only do i see avis budget groups stock and bonds suffering i believe a complete bankruptcy is more than likely avis has significant bonds maturing in the near future roughly  billion by january  i am skeptical how it will service these its creditors must see aviss diminishing earnings since  as well as the weakening collateral i wrote an article a few days ago reviewing the latest collapsing loan growth in the economy especially of note is the evaporation of new auto loan growth all while outstanding current auto loan delinquencies rise a worst case scenario i dont see any sudden change for this negative trend in the auto market let alone the economy as a whole i expect avis to only be further strained until it implodes it wasnt able to make any free cash flow and only polluted its balance sheet with debt during the post car bubble now in a slowing economy tightening federal reserve and declining auto market  this will be too much against it with its slim margins liabilities up to its neck and claimants and creditors howling at its doors it can surely be squeezed to death but its hard to say if it will go bankrupt even though i fully expect it in the long term markets are crazy these days give it time disclosure i amwe are short car htz f tsla i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article additional disclosure rather than shorting the following stocks i found more asymmetry low riskhigh reward from buying    year put options that are out of the money by buying the put options the investors downside is limited in case my thesis is wrong and if it proves correct upside is unlimited within the options time frame i have strike prices that are between  lower than current share prices as i fully expect the stocks to suffer significantly within that time frame also the optionality instead of shorting protects investors from potential rallies or short term swings from fed jawboning or etc this allows investors
