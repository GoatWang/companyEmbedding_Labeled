performance indicators of the preliminary consolidated statements at its annual press conference in munich   dott rudolf rizzolli ceo of sixt leasing ag  was the most successful year for sixt leasing in its corporate history for one thing the ipo in may  created the preconditions for us to pursue our strategic objectives independently and to build up our own financing structure for another thing in the preceding fiscal year we were spot on in reaching our growth and earnings expectations fleet leasing continued its path of profitable growth and managed to increase the rate of return in its contract portfolio the online retail business field is growing above average and is continually gaining market shares besides we have registered a gratifying trend over the last few months of generating good remarketing results with the vehicles returned from the private and commercial customer business the fleet management business field where we offer our expertise built up over years of managing large fleets also without lease financing managed to expand total revenue and profitability as well as its presence in europe we will continue this sustainable group strategy over the coming years key figures for the group in  yearonyear consolidated revenue rose  to eur  million  eur  million the strong growth is mainly the result of higher proceeds from the sale of returned vehicles operating revenue without sales revenue increased  to eur  million  eur  million and thus performed in line with strategy in  sixt leasing especially focused on increasing profitability in its fleet leasing business field while above all the online retail business field registered significant growth impetus sales revenue jumped by  to eur  million compared to eur  million the year before this development reflects the strong growth of the preceding years which has triggered a large number of vehicle returns with a certain time lag another effect is that since  the fleet management segment has offered the additional service of marketing customer vehicles the marketing of vehicles returned from the private and commercial customer business led to higher earnings contributions than expected this development was also supported by the expansion of marketing efforts via stationary channels sixt leasing groups net finance costs improved by  to eur  million  eur  million this development was facilitated by an improved interest rate environment and the redemption of financial liabilities following the inflow of proceeds from the ipo the sixt leasing group generated earnings before taxes ebt of eur  million an increase of   eur  million this gain was attributable above all to growth the measures taken to increase the contract portfolios profitability as well as lower

the groups total number of contracts inside and outside germany excluding franchisees increased to  and therefore exceeded the figure of  contracts for the first time compared with the figure recorded at the previous years reporting date  contracts the increase amounts to  this improvement is essentially due to the strong demand registered in the online retail business field and the successful key account acquisition in the fleet management segment group equity ratio of  at the end of the year under review sixt leasing reported group equity of eur  million the increase of eur  million from the figure at the end of  eur  million is essentially the result of the capital increase during the ipo and the capital injection of eur  million made by sixt se before the stock listing at  the equity ratio at the end of  was therefore above the targeted figure of at least  to date sixt leasing ag has negotiated financing agreements with bank partners amounting to more than eur  million and therefore reached the next milestone in setting up a financing structure independent from sixt se the conclusion of an abs financing agreement with a volume of up to eur  million is strived for mid

year given stronger proceeds from the sale of vehicles consolidated earnings will be positively affected by the measures taken to increase profitability in the contract portfolio in addition it is expected that the groups interest expenses can be lowered this is to be achieved on the one hand by reducing current financial liabilities as well as through the initiated substitution of the group financing provided by sixt se with the proceeds from the ipo and on the other hand by the utilisation of the negotiated new financing agreements with banking partners consequently the managing board

increased  to eur  million m  eur  million sales proceeds climbed  to eur  million after eur  million for the same period last year this strong increase is due above all to the expansion of the

revenue from services was eur  million and thus lower than the figure recorded in the same period last year eur  million  this development was due to the termination of the contract with one key

others as of  september  the fleet managements contract portfolio included around  contracts a decline of  compared with the number recorded on  september  approx  contracts after an intense tender and negotiation phase a key account confirmed the fleet management of about  vehicles following a successful implementation the contract portfolio of the fleet management business unit is therefore

due to be launched in the fourth quarter of  international fleets can be managed even more efficiently the new tool provides comprehensive transparency on all relevant vehicles which a company operates first external financing agreements concluded in the third quarter  sixt leasing ag concluded its first longterm financing agreements with its banking partners these will enable sixt leasing ag to gradually replace the group financing secured by sixt se and to finance its planned growth whilst simultaneously lowering its average interest rate payments outlook for the fullyear  following the positive business performance of the first nine months and the ongoing good environment for lease financing in europe the managing board continues to expect a slight increase in operating revenue compared to  total consolidated revenue are expected to be substantially higher than last year given stronger proceeds from the sale of vehicles consolidated earnings will be positively affected by the measures taken to increase profitability in the contract portfolio in addition it is expected that the groups interest expenses can be lowered this is to be achieved on the one hand by reducing current financial liabilities as well as through the initiated substitution of the group financing provided by sixt se with the proceeds from the ipo and on the other hand by the utilisation of the negotiated new financing agreements with banking partners consequently the managing board has specified its earnings forecast for  and now expects the groups ebt to rise from the eur  million recorded
