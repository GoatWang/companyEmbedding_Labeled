return it somewhere else yes although this may incur a oneway rental fee that will be shown during the booking process please note oneway rentals may be restricted if you plan on crossing borders so

collection is almost always possible but is dependent on the chosen tariff driving tips south korea has an excellent modern road network maintained to a high standard main cities are connected by an
