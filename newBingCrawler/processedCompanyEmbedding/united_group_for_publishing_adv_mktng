customers the purpose of advertising is to convince customers that a companys services or products are the best enhance the image of the company point out and create a need for products or services demonstrate new uses for established products announce new products and programs reinforce the salespeoples individual messages draw customers to the business and to hold existing customers sales promotions and brand loyaltyedit sales promotions are another way to advertise sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers one draws in and where they are and to jump start sales sales promotions include things like contests and games sweepstakes product giveaways samples coupons loyalty programs and discounts the ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action one way to create brand loyalty is to reward consumers for spending time interacting with the brandoriginal research this method may come in many forms like rewards card rewards programs and sampling criticismsedit main article criticism of advertising mobstr  visual pollution london  while advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth it is not without social costs unsolicited commercial email and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers advertising is increasingly invading public spaces such as schools which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation one of the most controversial criticisms of advertisement in the present day is that of the predominance of advertising of foods high in sugar fat and salt specifically to children critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices additionally children may not understand that they are being sold something and are therefore more impressionablebetter source needed michelle obama has criticized large food companies for advertising unhealthy foods largely towards children and has requested that food companies either limit their advertising to children or advertise foods that are more in line with dietary guidelines the other criticisms include the change that are brought by those advertisements on the society and also the deceiving ads that are aired and published by the corporations cosmetic and health industry are the ones which exploited the highest and created reasons of concern regulationedit there have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising some examples include restrictions for advertising alcohol tobacco or gambling imposed in many countries as well as the bans around advertising to children which exist in parts of europe advertising regulation focuses heavily on the veracity of the claims and as such there are often tighter restrictions placed around advertisements for food and healthcare products the advertising industries within some countries rely less on laws and more on systems of selfregulation advertisers and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold the general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is legal decent honest and truthful some selfregulatory organizations are funded by the industry but remain independent with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the advertising standards authority in the uk in the uk most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the uk town and county planning system currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the planning authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £ per offense in the us many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm as long ago as the s in the us there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside cities such as são paulo have introduced an outright ban with london also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays some governments restrict the languages that can be used in advertisements but advertisers may employ tricks to try avoiding them in france for instance advertisers sometimes print english words in bold and french translations in fine print to deal with article  of the  toubon law limiting the use of english the advertising of pricing information is another topic of concern for governments in the united states for instance it is common for businesses to only mention the existence and amount of applicable taxes at a later stage of a transaction in canada and new zealand taxes can be listed as separate items as long as they are quoted upfront in most other countries the advertised price must include all applicable taxes enabling customers to easily know how much it will cost them theoryedit see also advertising management hierarchyofeffects modelsedit various competing models of hierarchies of effects attempt to provide a theoretical underpinning to advertising practiceclarification needed the model of clow and baack clarifies the objectives of an advertising campaign and for each individual advertisement the model postulates six steps a buyer moves through when making a purchase awareness knowledge liking preference conviction purchase meansend theory suggests that an advertisement should contain a message or means that leads the consumer to a desired endstate leverage points aim to move the consumer from understanding a products benefits to linking those benefits with personal valuescitation needed marketing mixedit this section may stray from the topic of the article please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page january  main article marketing mix the marketing mix was proposed by professor e jerome mccarthy in the s it consists of four basic elements called the four ps product is the first p representing the actual product price represents the process of determining the value of a product place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer such as distribution channels market coverage and movement organization the last p stands for promotion which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to buy the product in the s the concept of four cs was introduced as a more customerdriven replacement of four ps there are two theories based on four cs lauterborns four cs consumer cost communication convenience  and shimizus four cs commodity cost communication channel in the cs compass model comarketing communications can include advertising sales promotion public relations publicity personal selling corporate identity internal communication sns mis advertising researchedit main article advertising research advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising it entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies advertising research includes pretesting also known as copy testing and posttesting of ads andor campaigns pretesting includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques including focus groups indepth target audience interviews oneonone interviews smallscale quantitative studies and physiological measurement the goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals posttesting employs many of the same techniques as pretesting usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement with the emergence of digital advertising technologies many firms have begun to continuously posttest ads using realtime data this may take the form of ab splittesting or multivariate testing continuous ad tracking and the communicus system are competing examples of posttesting advertising research types semioticsedit main article advertising research meanings between consumers and marketers depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday objectsneed quotation to verify semiotics is the study of signs and how they are interpreted advertising has many hidden signs and meaningscitation needed within brand names logos package designs print advertisements and television advertisements semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in for example advertisements logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels – known as the surface level and the underlying level the surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a productcitation needed these signs can be images words fonts colors or slogans the underlying level is made up of hidden meanings the combination of images words colors and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer the key to advertising analysis is the signifier and the signified the signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept a product has a signifier and a signified the signifier is the color brand name logo design and technology the signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative the denotative meaning is the meaning of the product a televisions denotative meaning might be that it is high definition the connotative meaning is the products deep and hidden meaning a connotative meaning of a television would be that it is topoftheline apples commercialswhen used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of apples target market they placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing however the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white ipod through white headphones through advertising the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an ipod the white color signifies almost all of apples products the semiotics of gender plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted when considering gender roles in advertising individuals are influenced by three categories certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message if the product is perceived as feminine or masculine second the characteristics of individuals can affect attention and elaboration of the message traditional or nontraditional gender role orientation lastly situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message there are two types of marketing communication claimsobjective and subjective objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature for instance a camera may have autofocus features subjective claims convey emotional subjective impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service they are nonphysical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived as they have no physical reality for instance the brochure has a beautiful design males tend to respond better to objective marketingcommunications claims while females tend to respond better to subjective marketing communications claims voiceovers are commonly used in advertising most voiceovers are done by men with figures of up to  having been reported there have been more female voiceovers in recent yearswhen but mainly for food household products and femininecare products gender effects in the processing of advertisingedit according to a  study by david statt females process information comprehensively while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures methods or strategies for solving problems which could have an effect on how they interpret advertisingneed quotation to verify according to this study men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message whereas females engage in more creative associative imagerylaced interpretation later research by a danish team found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance whereas its approach to women aims at transformation toward an impossible ideal of female presentationin paul suggetts article the objectification of women in advertising he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements who are too perfect to be real have on women in real life and gives men and young men a skewed and unrealistic expectation of women advertisings manipulation of womens aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film in erotic art in advertising on stage within music videos and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearancesthese advertisements are directed towards men not everyone agrees one critic viewed this monologic genderspecific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicizedneed quotation to verify there are some companies however like dove and aerie that are creating commercials to portray more natural women that are less photo shopped so more women and young girls are able to relate to them these commercials give more natural beauty standards more recent research by martin  reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads and on the affective tone of the advertising when feeling sad males prefer happy ads to boost their mood in contrast females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy the television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewers mood state susan wojcicki author of the article ads that empower women don’t just break stereotypes—they’re also effective discusses how advertising to women has changed since the first barbie commercial where a little girl tells the doll that she wants to be just like her little girls grow up watching advertisements of scantily clad women advertising things from trucks to burgers and wojcicki states it shows girls that theyre either arm candy or eye candy but in recent studies ads that are shown empowering women such as the like a girl ad campaign by always have a better effect on women when women see women being empowered on these ads theyre more likely to watch and share the videos the views of these ads on sites like youtube doubled and are more likely to be watched and shared by women see alsoedit business and economics portal media portal

available review books that reflect the  updates seeing as the college board has been less than helpful to teachers in this regard here is how i rank them amsco john newman is the best this book offers eight stimulusbased multiple choice questions and six short answers per chapter not period and  long essays and a dbq for each period of history the drawback to this book however is that students cannot purchase an answer key teachers can obtain one through the publisher but it must be shipped to a school there is also only one fulllength practice exam kaplan is also good as it offers five practice tests and  stimulus based multiple choice questions at least two short answers and either a long essay or a dbqs for each period of history this is what i will recommend to my students this year as i will likely keep the amsco for myself to use for inclass assessments barrons is pretty substandard for while it does offer three practice tests it only offers  stimulus based multiple choice questions and zero short answers long answers dbqs per period of history  steps to a  is the worst of the bunch with three practice tests and no stimulus based multiple choice short answers long essays or dbqs associated with each period of historyif you are an apush teacher i highly recommend this book whether you spend the extra  to buy the answer key from the publisher is up to you if you are an apush student i would also highly recommend this book but would also tell you to consider the kaplan book as they have a few more fulllength tests and answers are included although you sacrifice questions that are associated with each periodread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsfirst rate us history review book says a history teacherbyd mon november  format paperbackverified purchaseas a history teacher of  years ive seen a lot of bad review books being hauled around by students this one is unusually good because its simple straightforward and uncomplicated the writing is clear it covers the main topics and the practice ap exam questions are generally good its also not big and bulky like the more
