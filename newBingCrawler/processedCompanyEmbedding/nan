message in computing nan standing for not a number is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value especially in floatingpoint calculations systematic use of nans was introduced by the ieee  floatingpoint standard in  along with the representation of other nonfinite quantities like infinities two separate kinds of nans are provided termed quiet nans and signaling nans quiet nans are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values whereas signaling nans can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floatingpoint arithmetic for example  is undefined as a real number and so represented by nan the square root of a negative number is imaginary and thus not representable as a real floatingpoint number and so is represented by nan and nans may be used to represent missing values in computations contents  floating point  operations generating nan  quiet nan  signaling nan  function definition  integer nan  display  encoding  references  external links floating pointedit floating point precisions ieee  bit half binary bit single binary decimal bit double binary decimal bit quadruple binary decimal bit octuple binary extended precision formats bit or bit other minifloat microsoft binary format ibm floating point architecture arbitrary precision v t e in floatingpoint calculations nan is not the same as infinity although both are typically handled as special cases in floatingpoint representations of real numbers as well as in floatingpoint operations an invalid operation is also not the same as an arithmetic overflow which might return an infinity or an arithmetic underflow which would return the smallest normal number a denormal number or zero ieee  nans are represented with the exponent field filled with ones like infinity values and some nonzero number in the significand to make them distinct from infinity values this representation allows the definition of multiple distinct nan values depending on which bits are set in the significand but also on the value of the leading sign bit but applications are not required to provide distinct semantics for those distinct nan values for example a bitwise ieee floatingpoint standard single precision bit nan would be s  xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx where s is the sign most often ignored in applications and the x sequence represents a nonzero number the value zero encodes infinities some bits from x usually and preferably the first one are used to determine the type of nan quiet nan or signaling nan the remaining bits encode a payload most often ignored in applications floatingpoint operations other than ordered comparisons normally propagate a quiet nan qnan most floatingpoint operations on a signaling nan snan signal the invalid operation exception the default exception action is then the same as for qnan operands and they produce a qnan if producing a floatingpoint result a comparison with a nan always returns an unordered result even when comparing with itself the comparison predicates are either signaling or nonsignaling the signaling versions signal the invalid operation exception for such comparisons the equality and inequality predicates are nonsignaling so x  x returning false can be used to test if x is a quiet nan the other standard comparison predicates are all signaling if they receive a nan operand the standard also provides nonsignaling versions of these other predicates the predicate isnanx determines if a value is a nan and never signals an exception even if x is a signaling nan the propagation of quiet nans through arithmetic operations allows errors to be detected at the end of a sequence of operations without extensive testing during intermediate stages however note that depending on the language and the function nans can silently be removed in expressions that would give a constant result for all other floatingpoint values eg nan which may be defined as  so in general a later test for a set invalid flag is needed to detect all cases where nans are introduced  see function definition below for further details in section  of the current ieee  standard there are two anomalous functions the maxnum and minnum functions that return the maximum of two operands that are expected to be numbers that favor numbers — if just one of the operands is a nan then the value of the other operand is returned for the next revision of the ieee  standard it is planned to replace these functions as they are not associative when a signaling nan appears in an operand operations generating nanedit there are three kinds of operations that can return nan operations with a nan as at least one operand indeterminate forms the divisions  and ±∞±∞ the multiplications ×±∞ and ±∞× the additions ∞  −∞ −∞  ∞ and equivalent subtractions the standard has alternative functions for powers the standard pow function and the integer exponent pown function define  ∞ and ∞ as  the powr function defines all three indeterminate forms as invalid operations and so returns nan real operations with complex results for example the square root of a negative number the logarithm of a negative number the inverse sine or cosine of a number that is less than − or greater than  nans may also be explicitly assigned to variables typically as a representation for missing values prior to the ieee standard programmers often used a special value such as − to represent undefined or missing values but there was no guarantee that they would be handled consistently or correctly nans are not necessarily generated in all the above cases if an operation can produce an exception condition and traps are not masked then the operation will cause a trap instead if an operand is a quiet nan and there isnt also a signaling nan operand then there is no exception condition and the result is a quiet nan explicit assignments will not cause an exception even for signaling nans quiet nanedit quiet nans or qnans do not raise any additional exceptions as they propagate through most operations the exceptions are where the nan cannot simply be passed through unchanged to the output such as in format conversions or certain comparison operations which do not expect a nan input signaling nanedit signaling nans or snans are special forms of a nan that when consumed by most operations should raise the invalid operation exception and then if appropriate be quieted into a qnan that may then propagate they were introduced in ieee  there have been several ideas for how these might be used filling uninitialized memory with signaling nans would produce the invalid operation exception if the data is used before it is initialized using an snan as a placeholder for a more complicated object such as a representation of a number that has underflowed a representation of a number that has overflowed number in a higher precision format a complex number when encountered a trap handler could decode the snan and return an index to the computed result in practice this approach is faced with many complications the treatment of the sign bit of nans for some simple operations such as absolute value is different from that for arithmetic operations traps are not required by the standard there are other approaches to this sort of problem that would be more portable function definitionedit there are differences of opinion about the proper definition for the result of a numeric function that receives a quiet nan as input one view is that the nan should propagate to the output of the function in all cases to propagate the indication of an error another view and the one taken by the iso c and ieee  standards in general is that if the function has multiple arguments and the output is uniquely determined by all the nonnan inputs including infinity then that value should be the result thus for example the value returned by hypot±∞qnan and hypotqnan±∞ is ∞ the problem is particularly acute for the exponentiation function powxy  xy the expressions  ∞ and ∞ are considered indeterminate forms when they occur as limits just like ∞ ×  and the question of whether zero to the zero power should be defined as  has divided opinion if the output is considered as undefined when a parameter is undefined then powqnan should produce a qnan however math libraries have typically returned  for powy for any real number y and even when y is an infinity similarly they produce  for powx even when x is  or an infinity the rationale for returning the value  for the indeterminate forms was that the value of functions at singular points can be taken as a particular value if that value is in the limit the valueclarification needed for all but a vanishingly small part of a ball around the limit value of the parameters the  version of the ieee  standard says that powqnan and powqnan should both return  since they return  whatever else is used instead of quiet nan moreover iso c and later ieee  chose to specify pow−±∞   instead of qnan the reason of this choice is given in the c rationale generally c eschews a nan result where a numerical value is useful  the result of pow−∞ is ∞ because all large positive floatingpoint values are even integers to satisfy those wishing a more strict interpretation of how the power function should act the  standard defines two additional power functions pownxn where the exponent must be an integer and powrxy which returns a nan whenever a parameter is a nan or the exponentiation would give an indeterminate form integer nanedit most fixedsize integer formats do not have any way of explicitly indicating invalid data converting nan to an integer type or performing an integer operation whose floatingpoint equivalent would produce nan usually throws an exception in java such operations throw instances of javalangarithmeticexception in c they lead to undefined behavior perls mathbigint package uses nan for the result of strings that dont represent valid integers  perl mmathbigint e print mathbigintnewfoo nan displayedit different operating systems and programming languages may have different string representations of nan nan nan nan nan nanq nans qnan snan snan qnan ind since in practice encoded nans have both a sign and optional diagnostic information sometimes called a payload these will often be found in string representations of nans too for example nan nan snan nans other variants exist encodingedit in ieee  standardconforming floatingpoint storage formats nans are identified by specific predefined bit patterns unique to nans the sign bit does not matter binary format nans are represented with the exponential field filled with ones like infinity values and some nonzero number in the significand field to make them distinct from infinity values the original ieee  standard from  ieee  only described binary floatingpoint formats and did not specify how the signalingquiet state was to be tagged in practice the most significant bit of the significand field determined whether a nan is signaling or quiet two different implementations with reversed meanings resulted most processors including those of the intel and amds x family the motorola  family the aim powerpc family the arm family and the sun sparc family set the signalingquiet bit to nonzero if the nan is quiet and to zero if the nan is signaling thus on these processors the bit represents an isquiet flag in nans generated by the parisc and mips processors the signalingquiet bit is zero if the nan is quiet and nonzero if the nan is signaling thus on these processors the bit represents an issignaling flag the former choice has been preferred as it allows the implementation to quiet a signaling nan by just setting the signalingquiet bit to  the reverse is not possible with the latter choice because setting the signalingquiet bit to  could yield an infinity the  revision of the ieee  standard ieee  makes formal recommendations for the encoding of the signalingquiet state for binary formats the most significant bit of the significand field should be an isquiet flag ie this bit is nonzero if the nan is quiet and zero if the nan is signaling for decimal formats whether binary or decimal encoded a nan is identified by having the top five bits of the combination field after the sign bit set to ones the sixth bit of the field is the isquiet flag the standard follows the interpretation as an issignaling flag ie the signalingquiet bit is zero if the nan is quiet and nonzero if the nan is signaling a signaling nan is quieted by clearing this sixth bit the statevalue of the remaining bits ie other than the ones used to identify a nan as nan including the quietsignaling bits are not defined by the standard this value is called the payload of the nan if an operation has a single nan input and propagates it to the output the result nans payload should be that of the input nan this is not always possible for binary formats when the signalingquiet state is encoded by an issignaling flag as explained above if there are multiple nan inputs the result nans payload should be from one of the input nans the standard does not specify which referencesedit  a b bowman kenneth  an introduction to programming with idl
