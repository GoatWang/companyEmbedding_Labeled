development of technology and products which include the ql care analyzer qlca cardiovascular tests and paramagnetic beadsql care analyzerthe qlca is a pointofcare poc immunoassay analyzer the qlca represents a shift in the design of pointofcare poc analyzers the qlca uses a selfmetering cartridge to perform immunoassay tests at the poc each cartridge is preloaded with the companys beads which have been coated with specific proteins which result in binding the target marker a few drops of whole blood added to the cartridge initiate the binding reaction and the chemiluminescent reaction needed to deliver test results the qlca was designed specifically to deliver the required laboratory sensitivitycardiovascular teststo support the use of the qlca the company develops approximately four immunoassay tests designed to identify cardiac markers in the blood at the time of a heart attack these tests include troponin i tni plasminogen activator inhibitor type pai heart failure risk stratification hfrs and heart failure genomics risk hfgr tni testing is the routine testing for a heart attack tni is a heart muscle protein released in the bloodstream shortly after a heart attack myocardial infarction or mi its pai test helps to optimize the performance of a heart drug tpa or tissue plasminogen activator a clot buster used as the first line of therapy for mi patients the

response of heart failure patients to routinely administered drugs these tests are designed to be administered during the diagnostic and management process of patients with heart disease the companys tni test product is in the pilot testing phaseparamagnetic beadsclinical and research laboratories use paramagnetic particles as a solid surface in heterogeneous immunoassay tests paramagnetic magnetic beads are the solid phase employed during immunoassays tests in these laboratories the process of phase separation separation of the magnetic beads is done by application of an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic beads are made of iron oxide and all are traditionally black or brown the company has developed a process for plating the beads with a layer of silver making them white and sensitive to lightthe company competes with biosite diagnostics incorporated response biomedicals corp roche and abbott diagnostics » full overview of cgnhpk company address
