inc incorporated on december   is engaged in business of development of products targeting the immunoassay segment of the pointofcare in vitro diagnostic ivd testing market the company is engaged in development of technology and products which include the ql care analyzer qlca cardiovascular tests and paramagnetic beadsql care analyzerthe qlca is a pointofcare poc immunoassay analyzer the qlca represents a shift in the design of pointofcare poc analyzers the qlca uses a selfmetering cartridge to perform immunoassay tests at the poc each cartridge is preloaded with the companys beads which have been coated with specific proteins which result in binding the target marker a few drops of whole blood added to the cartridge initiate the binding reaction and the chemiluminescent reaction needed to deliver test results the qlca was designed specifically to deliver the required laboratory sensitivitycardiovascular teststo support the use of the qlca the company develops approximately four immunoassay tests designed to identify cardiac markers in the blood at the time of a heart attack these tests include troponin i tni plasminogen activator inhibitor type pai heart failure risk stratification hfrs and heart failure genomics risk hfgr tni testing is the routine testing for a heart attack tni is a heart muscle protein released in the bloodstream shortly after a heart attack myocardial infarction or mi its pai test helps to optimize the performance of a heart drug tpa or tissue plasminogen activator a clot buster used as the first line of therapy for mi patients the company is developing a test the heart failure risk stratification or hfrs test to stratify the risk of death in patients with heart failure the company is developing a hfgr test that predicts the response of heart failure patients to routinely administered drugs these tests are designed to be administered during the diagnostic and management process of patients with heart disease the companys tni test product is in the pilot testing phaseparamagnetic beadsclinical and research laboratories use paramagnetic particles as a solid surface in heterogeneous immunoassay tests paramagnetic magnetic beads are the solid phase employed during immunoassays tests in these laboratories the process of phase separation separation of the magnetic beads is done by application of an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic beads are made of iron oxide and all are traditionally black or brown the company has developed a process for plating the beads with a layer of silver making them white and sensitive to lightthe company competes with biosite diagnostics incorporated response biomedicals corp roche and abbott diagnostics » full overview of cgnhpk company address

merck chimie download pdf copy july   cardiogenics holdings inc otcbb cgnhd developer of the ultrasensitive ql care™ pointofcare poc analyzer and products for the immunoassay segment of the invitro diagnostics market announced that the companys subsidiary cardiogenics inc has entered into an agreement with merck chimie sas to adopt its proprietary biologicallinking technology to mercksupplied magnetic beads designed to increase yields in antibody manufacturing this is the second product agreement between the two companies the first covers a year supply agreement for cardiogenics silvercoated magnetic beads that merck will distribute to manufacturers of medical laboratory analyzers the beads covered by todays announcement are manufactured by merck chimie and designed to extract antibodies from cell culturing media and sera potentially reducing the cost of making antibodybased drugs one of the fastest growing areas of the pharmaceutical industry traditionally antibodies are extracted from media via stationary chromatography which is a lengthy process utilizing magnetic particles for this purpose was recently introduced to speed up the extraction and increase production efficiency antibody extraction products are roughly a  million market today utilizing magnetic beads for this purpose was introduced recently and is a rapid growth area which is expected to double in the next five years we are very pleased to broaden our relationship with merck chimie with a second product agreement stated yahia gawad chief executive officer of cardiogenics the technology for linking biological material for diagnostic beads is quite similar to linking biological material for antibody extraction beads being in the forefront of developing ultrasensitive magnetic beads and related encapsulation technologies the new agreement gives us an additional opportunity to showcase our proprietary expertise to one of the largest distributors of magnetic beads continued dr gawad related storiesnew monoclonal antibody shows efficacy in chronic migraine patients with medication overuseantibody drug conjugate could hold promise in improving treatment for childhood alladding new antibody to chemotherapy could bolster effects of cancer treatmentthis second agreement with merck differs from the first in that it involves beads manufactured by merck for antibody manufacturing a noncompeting market to cardiogenics silverplated beads under the agreement announced today cardiogenics will be paid an agreed upon fee per gram of beads shipped to merck chimie this represents a new product line for merck chimie which it intends to develop into a major part of its magnetic beads business the first agreement involves cardiogenics silverplated beads that merck will sell to manufacturers of large medical analyzers under this first agreement that covers paramagnetic beads for large medical diagnostic analyzers cardiogenics will receive  percent of mercks sales of beads supplied by cardiogenics merck is currently the largest distributors of diagnostic magnetic beads a  billion annual worldwide market both applications employ paramagnetic beads but each application requires beads with different characteristics suited to their use the magnetic beads being utilized under each of the merck agreements are fundamentally different from the proprietary magnetic beads used by cardiogenics in its ql care™ analyzer the company expects to submit a k application to the fda for the ql care™ analyzer and a test for troponini a key cardiac
