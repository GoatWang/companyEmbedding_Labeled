partly as a result of the grammleachbliley act of the late s which enabled different types of companies operating in the us financial services industry at that time to merge companies usually have two distinct approaches to this new type of business one approach would be a bank which simply buys an insurance company or an investment bank keeps the original brands of the acquired firm and adds the acquisition to its holding company simply to diversify its earnings outside the us eg japan nonfinancial services companies are permitted within the holding company in this scenario each company still looks independent and has its own customers etc in the other style a bank would simply create its own brokerage division or insurance division and attempt to sell those products to its own existing customers with incentives for combining all things with one company banksedit main article bank commercial banking servicesedit main article commercial bank a commercial bank is what is commonly

organize themselves into angel groups or angel networks to share resources and pool their investment capital conglomerates  a financial services company such as a universal bank that is active in more than one sector of the financial services market eg life insurance general insurance health insurance asset management retail banking wholesale banking investment banking etc a key rationale for the existence of such businesses is the existence of diversification benefits that are present when different types of businesses are aggregated ie bad things dont always happen at the same time as a consequence economic capital for a conglomerate is usually substantially less than economic capital is for the sum of its parts financial market utilities  organisations that are part of the

domestic firm regardless of ownership to a foreign firm or individual while financial services such as banking insurance and investment management are often seen as a domestic service an increasing proportion of financial services are now being handled abroad in other financial centres for a variety of reasons some smaller financial centres such as bermuda luxembourg and the cayman islands lack sufficient size for a domestic financial services sector and have developed a role providing services to nonresidents as offshore financial centres the increasing competitiveness of financial services has meant that some countries such as japan which were selfsufficient have increasingly imported financial services the leading financial exporter in terms of exports less imports is the united kingdom which had  billion of financial exports in  the uks position is helped by both unique institutions such as lloyds of london for insurance the baltic exchange for shipping etc and an
