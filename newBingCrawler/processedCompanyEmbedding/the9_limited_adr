investing rich duprey tmfcop jun   at am not that china needed another black eye these days but reports that tires manufactured in the country are missing a key safety component thats already caused two deaths certainly doesnt help china shed its growing image of shoddy products some  chinesemade tires  a number that could balloon to nearly a million depending on how many distributors have sold tires made at this factory  are going to be subject to a massive recall that threatens to bankrupt the small new jersey distributor that imports them foreign tire sales says it will begin a recall when it gets notification from the nhtsa we will wait to get their order and create a remedy plan and begin a recall said a company spokesman when the money runs out thats the end the problem is that a thin gum strip between the steel belts of a tire is allegedly missing foreign tire says the chinese manufacturer a company that its been doing business with for  years with no problems until now

other country both goodyear nysegt and cooper tire nysectb have moved production facilities to china in the face of rising us labor costs tires of course are merely the latest in a string of highprofile product problems emanating from china toymaker rc nasdaqrcrc is probably relieved that tires may now be the focus of substandard manufacturing processes since it was discovered that its hugely popular thomas the tank engine train toys were coated with lead paint  a process its chinese manufacturer also undertook on its own  it has been the subject of consumer and regulatory ire lead paint has been banned in the us for decades before the toy problem there was another cause for alarm the use of antifreeze in chinesemade toothpaste the ingredient was mislabeled as a benign similarsounding chemical and then there was tainted pet food that contained a flame retardant as an additive investing overseas can provide wonderful opportunities to profit from emerging markets and growing companies domiciled outside of united states for my money however china has yet to prove itself committed to ensuring the health safety and welfare of its products while the companies themselves walk a knifes edge of legitimacy in a communist society this requires us not only to carefully consider whether we want to invest in a company like game maker the nasdaqncty but also

games in china the looks to grow in china but its earnings are going the wrong way rick munarriz tmfbreakerrick aug   at am so now we know that the nasdaqncty is mortal after all the chinese online gaming specialist stumbled in its latest quarter clocking in well below wall street expectations as a new game wasnt enough to offset service outages of its popular version of blizzards world of warcraft net revenue inched  higher to  million but earnings fell  to hit  per share analysts were expecting the company to generate a profit of  a share on  million in revenue the server downtime was necessary for game upgrades and wall street was already braced for a bottomline dip however mays commercialization of soul of the ultimate nation should have helped a little more than it did this is a disappointing quarter for a couple of reasons yes the company missed its top and bottomline targets but the report also comes just one day after rival shanda nasdaqsnda blew past analyst expectations its the first time that the has missed wall street estimates after six straight marketthumping quarters finally this comes during the same quarter in which the was going to show us all how it is no longer a onetrick pony last quarters conference call identified how the planned to diversify into a multigame operator sure the has come a long way since it was little more than a lowly distributor of games in mainland china made by koreas webzen nasdaqwzen now its right up there with shanda and neteasecom nasdaqntes as the three online gaming companies that command a collective  stake of the promising internet video game market in china the closed out the quarter with  million registered users with as many as  of them playing at the same time despite the lackluster quarterly financials the is encouraged by the initial reaction of consumers to soul of the ultimate nation it also has another two games in the pipeline   if you believe in the niche the markets negative reaction to the companys report is a buying opportunity too much attention is being given to the governments crackdown on  internet cafes and not enough to the improving economy that will make homebased connectivity more common in the years to come if youre going to get excited about more conventional video game publishers closer to home like activision nasdaqatvi taketwo nasdaqttwo and thq nasdaqthqi then betting on the market leaders in chinas highmargin niche is more than reasonable sure the is mortal but as its product catalog can now tell you it also has soul for related foolishness review thes
