and  against this backdrop trade intensity will return to growth after the stagnation of recent years we believe that this growth will underpin more sales and marketing activities around the world which will have positive effects on the trade show industry more recently the sharp drop in oil prices will increase personal disposable income and we believe that increased consumer spending power
