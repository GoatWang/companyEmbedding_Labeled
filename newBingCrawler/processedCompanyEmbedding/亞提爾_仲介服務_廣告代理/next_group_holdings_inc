yield a favorable return and our failure to apply such proceeds effectively could diminish the value of your investment            we have a limited operating history and therefore we cannot ensure either in the near or longterm that we will be able to generate cash flow or profit or execute our business plan   the company is now engaged in new businesses started in each  and  as a result we have a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our business and an investment in our common stock may entail significantly more risk than the shares of common stock of a company with a substantial operating history our business operations are subject to numerous risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties associated with early stage enterprises you should consider an investment in our company in light of these risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties such risks include the absence of a lengthy operating history insufficient capital to fully realize our operating plan our ability to anticipate and adapt to a developing market a competitive environment characterized by wellcapitalized competitors our ability to identify attract and retain qualified personnel our reliance on key management personnel   because we are subject to these risks evaluating our business may be difficult we may be unable to successfully overcome these risks which could harm our business and prospects our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a costeffective manner if at all if we are unable to successfully address these risks there may be an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows   we may never achieve profitability from operations or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our shareholders   we may never achieve profitability from operations even if we do achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future there can be no assurance that future operations will be profitable or that we will be able to make or sustain distributions to our shareholders from cash from operations revenues and profits if any will depend upon various factors including whether we will be able to successfully implement our business plan and operating strategy we may not achieve our business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse impact on us in addition an inability to achieve profitability could have a detrimental effect on the long term capital appreciation of our common stock   the company has not yet achieved profitability from its business operations and is reliant on outside financing to fund operations   as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  including net losses after noncontrolling interests of  and  during the years ended december   and  this raises substantial doubt around our ability to continue as a going concern the company will be dependent on obtaining additional financing through equity or debt offerings which may cause future dilution   due to existing contractual obligations we may not achieve profitability   next group holdings andor its subsidiaries are required to perform certain obligations under material contracts with third parties next mobile is required to perform certain obligations under material contracts with sprint corporation auris and ez ild mm is required to perform certain obligations under material contracts with ariafone telekom ltd broadvox llc ip network america llc locus telecommunications llc and smt telecom also known in the telecommunications industry as “raza” next cala is required to perform certain obligations under material contracts with itc financial licenses inc ih financial licenses inc and the bancorp bank and visa usa inc nxtgn is required to perform certain obligations under material contracts with telarix inc vidyo inc and vitco            we are an early entrant in an emerging industry and the longterm viability of our business strategy is unproven   as an early entrant in this emerging industry we are subject to the risk that our business model and business plan may not prove to be a viable longterm business strategy if it turns out that our strategy is not a viable longterm business strategy we may not be able to generate meaningful cash flows which would materially and adversely affect the viability of our business and stock price   we have wellfinanced wellmanaged competitors and may not be able to adequately compete in our market   most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do some of our competitors have seasoned management teams with more experience and expertise in our industry than we do some competitors may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from among other things having substantially more available capital having a lower cost of capital having greater economies of scale and having enhanced operating efficiencies compared to ours   we may not be able to secure sufficient capital to effectively execute our business plan   we may not be able to attract and obtain sufficient capital from the equity and debt markets or any other capital markets to execute our business plan and grow our business if we do not have access to sufficient funding in the future we may not be able to make necessary capital expenditures necessary to execute our business plan and in that event our ability to generate revenue may be significantly impaired   if we cannot obtain financing our growth may be limited   recent events in the financial markets have had an adverse impact on the credit markets and as a result credit has become significantly more expensive and difficult to obtain if available at all some lenders are imposing more stringent credit terms and there has been and may continue to be a general reduction in the amount of credit available many banks are either unable or unwilling to provide new assetbased lending tightening credit markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms thereby increasing financing costs andor requiring us to accept financing with increasing restrictions if adverse conditions in the credit markets in particular with respect to our industry materially deteriorate our business could be materially and adversely affected our longterm ability to grow through additional investments will be limited if we cannot obtain additional financing market conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable terms   we anticipate being involved in a variety of litigation   although we have not been subject to any litigation to date we anticipate being involved in a range of court proceedings in the ordinary course of business as we continue to operate our business while we intend to vigorously defend any nonmeritorious action or challenge no assurance can be given that we will not incur significant expense relating to these matters or that they will not require significant management attention and adversely affect us   our business plan involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which may cause us to realize substantially different operating results than we hope for   in developing our business plan and business model we made a number of assumptions including assumptions related to annual operating costs market size and demand customer retention rates customer dropout rates default rates and local national and worldwide economic conditions these assumptions may prove inaccurate causing us our performance and operating results to differ significantly from the performance and operating results we have projected while developing our business plan and business model   operating our business on a larger scale could result in substantial increases in our expenses   as our business grows in size and complexity we can provide no assurance that we can successfully enter new markets or grow our business without incurring significant additional expenses that our management platform will ultimately prove to be scalable andor that we will be able to achieve economies of scale or we will be able to operate our business on a larger scale than the scale we have historically operated on            debt service obligations could adversely affect our operating results and could adversely affect our ability to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock   incurring debt could subject us to many risks including the risks that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions we will be subject to restrictive covenants that require us to satisfy and remain in compliance with certain financial requirements or that impose limitations on the type or extent of activities we conduct and we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing cash available for distribution to our stockholders funds available for operations and capital expenditures future business opportunities or other purposes additionally if we do not have sufficient funds to repay any debt we incur when it matures we may need to refinance the debt or raise additional equity if at the time of any refinancing prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancing increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flows and consequently cash available for distribution to our stockholders to the extent we are required to raise additional equity to satisfy such debt existing stockholders would see their interests diluted if we are unable to refinance our debt or raise additional equity on acceptable terms we may be forced to dispose of assets on disadvantageous terms potentially resulting in losses or the incurrence of special taxes and fees that apply to dispositions of assets to the extent we cannot meet any existing or future debt service obligations we will risk losing some or all of our assets that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure any unsecured debt agreements we enter into may contain specific crossdefault provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances   our financial results in future periods may not be reflective of our earning potential and may cause our stock price to decline   our financial results in future periods may not be representative of our future potential since we expect to experience rapid growth we will have a greater percentage of our portfolio invested in assets in the process of stabilization than we would expect to have as a more mature operation it will take time and significant cash resources to implement our business plan in addition future equity or debt financings may impact our financial results in the fiscal periods following such financings for the same reasons listed above   security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer   in the ordinary course of our business we use sophisticated call processing engines and other sophisticated telecommunications technology platforms and we acquire and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current

legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position   we are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us   we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies any member of our senior management may cease to provide services to us at any time the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results as we expand we will continue to need to attract and retain qualified additional senior management but may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all            our success depends in part upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial and operational personnel and the past performance of our senior management may not be indicative of future results   the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel competition for highly skilled managerial telecommunications financial and operational personnel is intense and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected   we are subject to regulation which may adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan   we operate in an everevolving

federal regulation   at the federal level congress and federal regulatory agencies have enacted and implemented new laws and regulations that affect the prepaid industry such the card act and fincen’s

financing equity financing or a combination of both we cannot be assured there will be a capital market robust enough for us to raise debt or equity based financing in the foreseeable future   going concern   the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have significant cash or other current assets nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern              during the next year the company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission and the payment of expenses associated with research and development associated with the launch of the company’s cuentas branded nextcala general purpose reloadable card the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital   historically it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the company’s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse affect upon it and its shareholders     operating

  net loss           noncash expenses and gains               change in accounts payable               other changes in working capital              net cash used in operating activities             the change in accounts payable increased during the year ended december   due to increased legal fees associated with completing our reverse acquisition and increased costs associated with maintaining public filings additionally we experienced increased costs associated with our tel business and decreased cash flows from our day to day operations from which to pay these obligations noncash expenses and gains increased during the year ended december   due to the amortization of debt discounts stock based compensation and impairment losses that were not present during the year ended december     investing activities   cash flows provided by investing activities was  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december   cash from investing activities during the year ended december   consisted of cash receipts from related party receivables of  cash contributed in acquisitions from related parties of  and cash acquired in acquisitions of  cash from investing activities during the year ended december   consisted of  received form related party receivables and  paid for finance deposits   financing activities   net cash provided by financing activities were

  net cash used in operating activities                        during the year ended december   the company relied less on related party loans and more on financing from convertible debt which resulted in an increase in proceeds from convertible notes payable of  and decrease in proceeds from related party loans of  the total increase in cash provided by financing activities of  during the year ended december   reflects the increased costs of operating our business post reverse acquisition   since inception we have financed our cash flow requirements through issuance of common stock related party advances and debt as we expand our activities we may and most likely will continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations additionally we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings to the extent available or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital in the future we need to generate sufficient revenues from sales in order to eliminate or reduce the need to sell additional stock or obtain additional loans there can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds to execute our business plan   we anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next twelve months our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such risks for us include but are not limited to an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth   to address these risks we must among other things obtain a customer base implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy continually develop and upgrade our website respond to competitive developments and attract retain and motivate qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any such arrangements in the foreseeable future   impact of inflation   the company does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in operation of the business   offbalance sheet arrangements   there are no offbalance sheet arrangements between the company and any other entity that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial conditions changes in financial conditions revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders            going concern   the company has a working capital deficiency of  and accumulated deficit of  as of december   these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   critical accounting policies   the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements which we discuss under the heading “results of operations” following this section of our mda some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain   we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and condition and that require complex management judgment   use of estimates   the preparation of the company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the company’s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission include where applicable disclosures of estimates assumptions uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the company   fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash accounts payable and related party payables approximate the respective fair values due to the short maturities of these items the company does not hold any investments that are availableforsale   as required by the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the fasb asc fair value is measured based on a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level  observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level  inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level  unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions   the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below   level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   level  quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability   level  prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable supported by little or no market activity            impairment of longlived assets   the company accounts for its longlived assets in accordance with asc topic  “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” asc topic  requires that longlived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost or carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate the company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset including eventual disposition if the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value or disposable value at december   the company performed an impairment analysis and determined the present value of future cash flows from its investment in a certain subsidiary to be  as such impairment losses of  million and  million were recorded on goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended december   there was no impairment loss recorded during the year ended december     sharebased compensation expense   we calculate sharebased compensation expense for option awards and warrant issuances “sharebased awards” based on the estimated grantissuedate fair value using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model “blackscholes model” and recognize the expense on a straightline basis over the vesting period net of estimated forfeitures the blackscholes model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price the weighted average riskfree interest rate and the vesting period of the sharebased award in determining the fair value of sharebased awards although we believe our assumptions used to calculate sharebased compensation expense are reasonable these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty in addition significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period   new accounting pronouncements   the company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect these pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed and the company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations    item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   this item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company   item  financial statements and supplementary data   see index to financial statements and financial statement schedules appearing on page f through f of this form k   item  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   we have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accounting or financial disclosures            item a t controls and procedures   our principal executive officer arik maimon and principal financial officer michael deprado evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the exchange act as of the year end covered by this report based on that evaluation they have concluded that as of december   and  our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control as is defined in the securities exchange act of  these internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls consequently an effective internal control system can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance with respect to reporting financial information   our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that i pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made and in accordance with our management and directors authorization and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements   management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in the internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” based upon this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december     based on that evaluation management concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective due to the following material weakness identified   lack of appropriate segregation of duties   lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of supervision and review and   there is an overreliance upon independent financial reporting consultants for review of critical accounting areas and disclosures and material nonstandard transactions   implemented or planned remedial actions in response to the material weaknesses   we will continue to strive to correct the above noted weakness in internal control once we have adequate funds to do so we believe appointing a director who qualifies as a financial expert will improve the overall performance of our control over our financial reporting   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended december   that materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   the company’s management including the chief executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that its disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake   item b other information   none            part iii   item  directors executive officers and corporate

accounting policies for next group holdings inc is presented to assist in understanding the company’s financial statements the company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” accounting and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements   use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are used

company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured the company primarily generates revenues through the sale of prepaid calling minutes to consumers

from commissions earned from incomm a leading financial services provider and nxtgn generated revenues from the sale of voice over ip platform software during the years ended december   and      property and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from three to five years   maintenance and repair costs are expensed as they are incurred while renewals and improvements which extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized at the time of retirement or disposal of property and equipment the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated results of operations   impairment of longlived assets   in accordance with asc topic  formerly sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on the company’s ability to recover the carrying value of its asset based on estimates of its undiscounted future cash flows if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value the company recorded impairment losses of  of which  is included in losses from discontinued operations and  during the years ended december   and  refer to note  for further discussion     f        noncontrolling interest   the company reports the noncontrolling interest in its majority owned subsidiaries in the consolidated balance sheets within the stockholders’ deficit section separately from the company’s stockholders’ deficit noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling interest holders’ proportionate share of the equity of the company’s majorityowned subsidiaries noncontrolling interest is adjusted for the noncontrolling interest holders’ proportionate share of the earnings or losses and other comprehensive income loss and the noncontrolling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance    derivative and fair value of financial instruments   fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes in assessing the convertible debt instruments management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement if the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under asc  the company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under asc    once determined derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives   fair value of certain of the company’s financial instruments including cash accounts receivable account payable accrued expenses notes payables and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities the company measures and reports fair value in accordance with asc  “fair value measurements and disclosure” defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value investments   fair value as defined in asc  is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants principal or most advantageous markets and an inuse or an inexchange valuation premise the fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance which includes among other things the company’s credit risk   valuation techniques are generally classified into three categories the market approach the income approach and the cost approach the selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability and the quality and availability of inputs valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc  must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs asc  also provides fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows   level  quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities   level  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and   level  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values   fair value measurements are required to be disclosed by the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs in level  measurements are subject to expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following i total gains or losses for the period realized and unrealized segregating those gains or losses included in earnings and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported in the statement of income     f        except as discussed in note  – derivative liabilities the company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in accordance with asc  as of december   and     income taxes   income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled use of net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes may be limited by internal revenue code section  if a change of ownership occurs   basic income loss per share   basic income loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity   at december   the company had fifteen outstanding convertible notes payable with conversion rights that are exercisable the remaining convertible notes outstanding at december   were not convertible until six months after issuance or january  the amount of outstanding principal on these convertible notes total  plus accrued interest of  for total convertible debts as of december   of  representing  new dilutive common shares if converted at the applicable rates the effects of these notes have been excluded as the conversion would be antidilutive due to the net loss incurred in each period presented   dividends   the company has not

company records a debt discount related to the issuance of convertible debts that have conversion features at adjustable rates the debt discount for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds as an increase in additional paidin capital and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features the debt discount will be accreted by recording additional noncash gains and losses related to the change in fair market values of derivative liabilities over the life of the
