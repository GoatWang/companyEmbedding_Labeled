advertising market where advertisers reward providers who can deliver performance and return on advertising investment the fundamental strategy of the business is to drive advertiser performance across all mediums and geographies key elements of the propel strategy include    increasing quality inventory from supply sources that deliver improved advertiser performance this includes increasing propel’s proportion of inventory coming from its owned and operated memberbased network through increased investment in media buying to acquire users             expanding revenues that come from video advertisers as more advertiser budget moves from television to online we see opportunities to increase the revenue we generate from distributing video advertisements on behalf of our advertisers        expanding revenues that come from display advertisers as display advertising budgets continue to increase we see the opportunity to increase revenues we generate from distributing display advertisements on behalf of our advertisers        expanding ad inventory by increasing our publisherbased syndication program to expand supply for video and display advertisements        migrating into the mobile market to take advantage of advertiser demand for this segment of the market        expanding globally   business   overview   propel generates revenue by selling advertising to advertisers and serving the advertising to users while they browse the internet we have two monetization models   in one model which we sometimes refer to herein as the “memberbased business” we have a direct relationship with users who have installed an extension in the users’ browsers or software that allows us to serve them advertising through their browsers as an overlay image on the content that they are viewing or in a new browser window or tab in this model we have no publisher relationship and as a result no publisher payments we acquire a relationship with users in two ways i through our owned and operated properties and ii through properties developed by our third party application partners in each case a user who accepts free access to our owned and operated property or to the application partner’s property agrees to receive advertisements served by us from advertisers using our propel media platform as they browse the internet this allows us or our third party application partners to install an extension to the user’s browser or download software onto the user’s computer the extension or software allows us to travel with the user as the user views content on the internet we capture the urls and keywords of certain browsing pages viewed and in real time determine if we have advertisers who have bid on keywords or the url being browsed if so we serve the relevant advertising in some situations we have advertisers who wish to have us serve advertising on a runofnetwork basis which then permits us to serve ads across our user base without targeting parameters being established   during  as we transitioned away from the declining revenues from third party application partners we focused on growing our user base via the marketing of our own and operated properties such as free casual games and free lifestyle content we continue to have a distinct media buying organization that purchases advertising on various online ad platforms and is dedicated to developing the user base acquired through our owned and operated properties for our memberbased business model   in the second model which we sometimes refer to herein as the “publisher business model” we develop publisher based syndication supply channels through relationships with web publishers exchanges and other supply channels in this model there is a direct publisher relationship and we use the traffic from publishers as the user base to whom we serve ads no extension or software is downloaded or otherwise used in this model we enter into a revenue share or cpm as defined below payment model with the publisher   advertiser sales and account management   propel is focused on building relationships with digital advertisers            propel currently services over  active advertisers and its advertiser clients include but are not limited to direct advertisers affiliate advertisers lead generation advertisers and leading advertising agencies and advertising networks and exchanges representing premium brands   propel’s sales team and account management organization are comprised collectively of  employees they call on and support advertisers and their advertising campaigns the sales and account management teams are responsible for acquiring new advertisers developing campaign goals and strategies with advertisers or their agents and working with the clients to establish the ad formats that will run they are also responsible for developing the return on investment metrics with the advertiser that will be used to help the account management organization or the advertiser understand performance as the campaign is running and will allow the account management organization the salesperson and the advertiser to optimize campaigns to meet campaign goals   campaigns are set up and managed by either the salesperson account manager or the advertiser themselves these activities are executed through the propel media platform this platform allows propel to work with advertisers to   ● process advertiser applications       ● accept or reject advertiser applications       ● record advertiser information payment terms and semiautomate the advance payment process through credit card or wire transfer if required       ● set up campaigns including   o specifying the ad units to be employed for the campaign which include   § video ads –video ads are served to its audience on a runofnetwork basis and the advertiser is charged when the ad is displayed this is priced on a cost per thousand impressions or cpm       § display ads – these are traditional box ads combining graphical images with ad copy these ads are served based on targeted keywords the advertiser is charged when the ad is displayed this is referred to as cost per view or cpv       § textlink ads – ads that appear when the consumer places the mouse cursor over the targeted keyword if the user clicks on the ad the user is taken to the advertiser’s offer landing page that provides more information the advertiser is only charged if the consumer clicks on the ad this is referred to as cost per click or cpc       § native ads – these are content based ads that are generally served in a grouping of four to six native ad tiles with each tile representing a different ad or advertiser if the user clicks on the ad tile the user is taken to the content and ad offers the advertiser is charged on a cpc basis   o establishing targeting parameters by keywords and urls that the advertiser chooses       o establishment of bid price for keywords and urls as propel media platform is a bidbased platform the advertiser’s ad will be displayed if its bid price wins over other advertisers who are also bidding to serve their ads       o establish links to ad creative that will run in each campaign     ● generate reports and metrics that allow real time campaign performance management            audience development   propel advertisers’ campaigns are dependent on having an audience to receive the advertising propel’s model is to reach its audience either directly or via partners   propel reaches audiences for its advertisers through two different business models     ● the memberbased business model acquires a relationship with users in two ways   o owned and operated properties  propel develops and distributes multiple free casual gaming sites and other lifestyle content properties in this method propel buys media and advertises these gaming sites and lifestyle content properties on various online destinations including gaming and social media portals propel provides its audience with access to its premium gaming and lifestyle content for free and obtains the user’s permission to serve advertising to them while they peruse content on the web propel incurs media costs to acquire audiences in this manner       o application partners’ properties  propel partners with third party application developers who have their own audience bases and are seeking to serve advertising to them in this instance propel partners with these third party application developers to increase the total audience that propel’s advertisers can reach with their advertisements propel operates under a revenue share model with its partners in this distribution model    ● the publisher business model serves advertising through publisher based syndication supply channels  in this model propel develops direct relationships with publishers networks and exchanges for supply and then purchases impressions from these supply sources propel operates under a revenue share model or on a fixed cpm with its partners in this distribution model    during  as we transitioned away from the declining revenues from third party application partners we focused on growing our user base via the marketing of our own and operated properties such as free casual games and free lifestyle content this led to  of our  revenue being generated by our owned and operated audience our revenue mix is expected to continue to be heavily weighted to supply coming from owned and operated audience and publisher business as opposed to our third party application partners   solutions technology  services   propel offers advertisers the ability to reach audiences in which performance is measured by their willingness to view an ad or click through to the advertisers landing page for more information or complete a conversion action as defined by the advertiser typical conversions might include for example making a purchase filling out an automobile test drive form taking a survey or filling out a request for more information from online education providers superior performance is achieved by having engaging ad units that target the right audiences and are served at the right scale and frequency although most creative work is done by the client propel offers design services to help improve campaign performance through more impactful creative ads and landing pages propel offers video display text link and native ad units that are designed for maximum impact and conversions   audience targeting is achieved through keywords and urls advertisers bid on keyword and url targets which they believe will be relevant to the content that their audiences will be consuming an advertiser will bid on anywhere from a few to thousands of keywords and urls at varying bid prices based on the importance of the keyword or url and the competition from other advertisers for that same keyword or url advertisers may raise or lower keyword or url bid prices as they see how effective various keywords or urls perform for their campaign if a keyword or url target is performing well for an advertiser the advertiser may want to increase the number of individuals clicking on the advertiser’s advertisements this is accomplished by raising the bid price the advertiser is willing to pay to have the advertiser’s ad served which in turn will generate more impressions and hopefully increased conversions conversely if a keyword or url is not performing bid prices might be lowered in order to not spend advertising budget on underperforming keywords or urls            propel’s proprietary ad serving technologies are geared toward optimizing direct response advertiser campaigns to ensure that the desired performance criteria are generated within advertiser defined cost parameters it is through propel’s ad serving technologies that propel matches advertisers with targeted audiences in a real time auction environment propel’s ad serving technologies determine if there are relevant keywords or urls on the webpage that an audience member is perusing and that an advertiser or advertisers are targeting it then evaluates the parameters for serving an ad including the number of times an audience member has been exposed to a particular ad the time intervals between ads the competitive bid prices the conversion data time of day parameters that the advertiser has chosen to show ads and other relevant segmenting options the ad server then decides which advertiser’s ad to serve to a particular audience member this generally takes place in the  milliseconds that generally takes a webpage to load on a computer and occurs tens of millions of times per day   propel media platform is the propel advertiser interface platform that registers campaign input parameters that drive its ad serving to carry out campaigns as defined by the advertiser the propel media platform interface allows advertisers to establish and direct what and where creative assets ads are to be found the keyword url and geographic targets for each campaign the bid price for each keyword and url target day part serving parameters serving intervals between ad impressions budget parameters on a daily basis and other segmenting options   key benefits of the platform are     ● comprehensive – selfserve platform with managed account solutions         ● cost effective – bid based cost per click cpc cost per view cpv and cost per thousand cpm pricing         ● targeted data – capable of targeting based on a variety of attributes such as frequency

optimization and management is all performed through the propel media platform interface   video offerings   in  propel focused on expanding its video offerings to existing and new advertisers on our user network the memberbased business model and on our expanding syndication network of publishers exchanges and marketplaces the publisher business model            propel is focused on delivering a set of comprehensive solutions supported by industry leading services and a proven video advertising technology platform   propel’s objective is to ensure that every online advertising campaign dynamically achieves key performance metrics through brandsafe delivery to the right audience against relevant content in engaging interactive video ad formats we believe consumers are spending more time online watching video content and advertisers are increasingly shifting budgets from television to online platforms   the propel video solutions are designed to address the needs of traditional direct relationships with brands and their agencies as well as the expanding evolution of programmatic advertisers we believe that regardless of how online advertising campaigns are executed whether by media buying or through programmatic automation the same elements of relevant content audiences and performance are required to optimize brand value   competition   propel operates in a dynamic and competitive market influenced by trends across multiple industries including but not limited to the digital advertising industry the video content marketing industry and the digital publishing industry we expect that competition in propel’s industry will continue to intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation the continuing maturation of the industry and low barriers to entry   the display video desktop application and online advertising solutions market is highly competitive with many companies providing competing solutions propel competes with google rythmone rocketfuel tremor criteo iac facebook vibrant and many demand side advertiser platforms supply side advertising platforms ad networks exchanges such as brightroll inc and yume inc and desktop and mobile applications   we believe that propel competes favorably with an emphasis on key competitive factors including strong relationships with online advertisers publishers and third party application developers an advanced and scalable technology platform effective audience engagement and goalbased performance data driven benchmarks and brand and campaign metrics for advertising campaigns brand safety and proven performance with respect to these factors we believe that propel’s effective scalable and stable goal based performance platform well positions propel as an

development expense during the years ended december   and  respectively   propel continues to develop a robust platform to enable automation and optimization of online advertising and publisher inventory propel’s strategy incorporates enhanced optimization management capabilities for video display and text ad units capitalizing on proprietary and thirdparty data tools and reporting functionality propel will continue to analyze audience insights and offer reporting functionalities to provide propel and its advertisers publishers and third party application developers with a transparent understanding of propel’s performance            intellectual property   propel’s ability to protect its intellectual property including its technologies will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of its business propel has established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of its proprietary information such as the use of license agreements with customers and its use of confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with its employees consultants business partners and advisors where appropriate these methods however may not afford complete protection for propel’s intellectual property and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop technologies similar or superior to those of propel   propel currently has secured one patent which expires on july   and multiple trademarks protecting its intellectual property and its brands   government regulation   propel is subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the online advertising business in addition many areas of law that apply to propel’s business are still evolving and could potentially affect its business to the extent they restrict its business practices or impose a greater risk of liability we are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in propel’s industry alleging various violations of privacy or data security related laws   privacy   privacy and data protection laws and regulations play a significant role in propel’s industry in the united states at both the state and federal level there are laws that govern activities such as the collection use and disclosure of data by companies like propel   online advertising activities in the united states have primarily been subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the “ftc” which has regularly relied upon section  of the federal trade commission act or section  to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices section  has been the primary regulatory tool used to enforce against alleged violations of consumer privacy interests in addition as propel continues expanding into other foreign countries and jurisdictions propel increasingly becomes subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how it conducts business in particular european data protection laws can be more restrictive regarding the collection use and disclosure of data than those in the united states   additionally us and foreign governments have enacted considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect augment analyze use and share anonymous data such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to track people online the european union the “eu” and some eu member states have already implemented legislation and regulations requiring advertisers to obtain specific types of notice and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals and their online behavior and deliver targeted advertisements it remains a possibility that additional legislation and regulations may be passed or otherwise issued in the future propel also participates in industry selfregulatory programs under which in addition to other compliance obligations it provides consumers with notice about its use of cookies and its collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of its offerings the rules and policies of the selfregulatory programs that propel participates in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon it in the future   any failure or perceived failure by propel to comply with us federal state or international laws or regulations pertaining to privacy or data protection or other policies selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others            advertising content   even though propel’s advertisers create the content of their ads and propel receives contractual protections from its advertisers propel may nevertheless be subject to regulations concerning the content of their ads federal and state laws governing intellectual property or other thirdparty rights could apply to the content of ads propel places even if it has no part in the creation of the ad laws and regulations regarding unfair and deceptive advertising sweepstakes advertising to children and other consumer protection regulations may also apply to the ads propel places on behalf of clients   employees   in april  as part of a strategic plan designed to improve operational and cost efficiencies the company completed a workforce reduction and the consolidation of office facilities as of december   propel had  fulltime employees  parttime employees none of propel’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement propel considers its relationship with its employees to be

following information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item  of part ii of this form k and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item  of part ii of this form k   propel’s business financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause propel’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect propel’s business financial condition operating results and stock price   because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting propel’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods            risks related to our business   any material reduction in spending by our key advertisers andor our inability to retain such key advertisers could adversely impact our business and results of operations   our success requires us to sell advertising through our propel media platform to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing advertisers and ad agencies and to develop new relationships with other advertisers and ad agencies these advertising sources generally do not include longterm obligations requiring them to purchase from us and are cancelable at any time or upon short notice and without a termination penalty as a result we have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams from our advertisers even if they have been longstanding advertisers our advertisers’ usage may decline fluctuate or cease all together as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to   ● the performance of their ad campaigns and their perception of the efficacy and efficiency of their advertising campaign utilizing our solutions       ● changes in the economic conditions of advertisers whether it is economic conditions specific to the advertiser or the advertiser’s particular industry or the economy in general       ● changes in the advertisers’ business models and marketing strategies that do not include us in their forward marketing plans       ● our access to relevant ad serving opportunities and ad inventory       ● our ability to deliver ad campaigns in full       ● their satisfaction with our solutions and our client support       ● the ability of our optimization algorithms underlying our solutions to deliver better rates of return on ad spend dollars than competing solutions       ● seasonal patterns in advertisers’ spending which tend to be discretionary       ● the pricing of our solutions and competing solutions and       ● reductions in spending levels or changes in advertisers’ strategies and budgets regarding spending levels for online advertising   if a major advertiser decides to materially reduce its use of our services it could do so on short or no notice we cannot ensure that our advertisers will continue to use our services or that we will be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing advertisers with new advertisers from whom we generate comparable revenue   seasonal fluctuations in digital advertising activity could adversely affect our cash flows   many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing accordingly our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature with the fourth quarter of each calendar year historically representing the largest percentage of our total revenue for the year our operating cash flows could also fluctuate materially from period to period as a result of these seasonal fluctuations   our revenues are impacted by seasonal fluctuations and decreases or delays in audience acquisition and advertising spending which make any forecasting of our operating results inherently uncertain   our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to both our ability to acquire audiences and advertiser spend  further expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns our revenue could be materially reduced and our ability to grow our revenues could be negatively impacted by a decline in our audience a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or a decline in the economy in general  due to such risks you should not rely on quartertoquarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results  further forecasting economic activity is inherently difficult and the nature of our business provides only limited visibility for our future operating results in addition we do not generally have longterm contracts with our advertiser customers accordingly our ability to forecast future operating results is limited any such forecasts would be inherently uncertain and our quarterly results could be quite volatile            our sales efforts and relationships with advertisers publishers third party application developers and other partners require significant time and expense which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to secure substantial commitments from them   attracting new advertisers third party application developers publishers and other partners requires substantial time and expense and we may not be successful in establishing new relationships or in maintaining or advancing our current relationships with respect to advertisers and agencies it may be difficult to identify engage and market to potential advertisers and agencies who do not currently spend on contextual display or digital video advertising or are unfamiliar with our current solutions furthermore many of our advertiser and agency customers’ purchasing and buying decisions typically require input from multiple internal constituencies as a result we must identify those persons involved in the purchasing decision and devote a sufficient amount of time to presenting our solutions to each of those persons with respect to our publishers and third party application developers we seek to establish longterm relationships to ensure audience reach for our advertisers as a result we invest significant time in cultivating relationships with our third party application developers publishers and other partners to ensure they understand the potential benefits of monetization of their inventory or applications with us rather than other parties the relationship building process can take many months and may not result in us winning an opportunity with any given advertiser agency third party application developer publisher or other potential partner moreover even when opportunities are won the contractual obligation may be shortterm and terminable by the other party upon short or no notice for example many of our advertising sources are direct advertisers and ad exchanges that programmatically bid and buy without obligation or commitment and can terminate or stop buying immediately therefore we may invest significant resources into winning an opportunity only to result in a shortterm commitment from our clients   our solutions and business model are relatively unique and often require us to spend substantial time and effort educating potential advertisers third party application developers publishers and other partners about our solutions including providing demonstrations this process can be costly and timeconsuming if we are not successful in targeting supporting and streamlining our sales processes our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected   we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may not be able to compete successfully   the digital advertising market is highly competitive with many companies providing competing solutions we compete with google rythmone rocketfuel tremor criteo iac facebook vibrant and many demand side advertiser platforms supply side advertising platforms ad networks and exchanges such as brightroll inc and yume inc and desktop and mobile applications many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have more capital to invest in their businesses furthermore our competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with their digital media property partners advertisers or other parties thereby limiting our ability to promote our solutions and generate revenue competitive pressures could require us to lower our prices for our advertisers or increase the prices we pay to publishers and third party application developers   additionally some large advertising agencies that represent our current advertising customers have their own relationships with digital media properties and can directly connect advertisers with digital media properties our business will suffer to the extent that our advertisers and publishers purchase and sell inventory directly from one another or through other companies that act as intermediaries between them other companies that offer analytics mediation exchange or other third party solutions have or may become intermediaries between our clients and thereby compete with us in addition we also compete with many of the same large scale competitors set forth above in the acquisition of audiences as competition for audience increases the cost of acquiring audiences could rise            any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions and could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share accordingly we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors   we and our distribution partners rely on the ability to offer our audience downloadable applications which allows us and our distribution partners to offer services and serve advertising to our audience should we or our distribution partners be unable in the future to profitably acquire new audiences due to an inability to distribute downloadable applications via the internet our ability to generate revenues could be significantly negatively impacted   our ability to serve ads from our advertisers and to generate revenues is dependent on our ability to provide the appropriate audiences for our advertisers’ campaigns we acquire audiences in a variety of ways including offering free downloadable applications ourselves or via our distribution partners that audiences agree to install and which allow us to serve advertising to them if our ability to acquire audiences through this value exchange is disrupted our advertising business model could be impaired possible reasons for such disruption could include audiences not valuing the offered application costs of marketing the software being too high the lifetime value of the acquired audiences not covering the cost of acquiring the audiences or ad blockers antivirus protection blockers or other applications preventing our applications from being installed or our ads from being served   the dominant players in our industry including microsoft and google have modified their guidelines and policies to prevent or limit the ability to offer downloadable applications or to serve advertising to audiences that have installed downloadable applications this may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues and could cause a material adverse effect on our financial results   in an effort to protect their audiences from unwanted applications or unwanted behaviors while using their software and to control the computing experience the dominant industry players who control access to audiences via their browsers and operating systems are regularly updating their policies and procedures to regulate the applications that may be installed on a computer we cannot predict the changes that these players such as google or microsoft might implement if they implement changes to their policies and procedures that limit our ability or third party application developers’ or other partners’ abilities to distribute their applications online or if they disable our applications or the applications of our third party application developers our memberbased business will have difficulties acquiring audiences at the scale that is required to meet the demands of our advertisers this could materially affect our financial results   in order to maintain our revenue and grow our member based we need to continuously acquire and reach new audiences and maintain audience engagement with our application products through advertising campaigns   our memberbased business model depends on reaching audiences through relationships with third party application developers and distribution partners as well as through direct media buying for our owned and operated properties in all cases our growth is dependent on our ability to reach maintain and expand audiences the market to generate audiences for applications is highly competitive and we experience significant competition for audience engagement with our applications from other vendors who use application advertising and search business models we generate the substantial majority of revenues associated with our audiences during the first year after an application is installed in order to maintain our current revenues and grow our business we need to continuously engage in marketing campaigns aimed at maintaining audience engagement with our applications and acquiring new audiences if we fail to conduct such marketing campaigns or any of our marketing campaigns prove less successful than anticipated either because we are not able to accurately project the number of completed installations of the applications or otherwise we expect that our audience engagement would decline materially which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results            our business and prospects would also be harmed if new versions or upgrades of operating systems and internet browsers adversely impact the process or platform by which audiences install our applications and audiences view our advertisements the application installation process for our solutions is currently straightforward and includes detailed information about our products and services in the future operating systems internet browsers ad blockers and security programs could introduce new features or limitations that would make it more difficult to install applications and serve advertising and may negatively impact the growth of our audience base and adversely impact our business and prospects   any significant decline in desktop personal computer audiences accessing the internet could significantly diminish the value of our solutions in our memberbased business model and cause us to lose revenue since most of our revenue generating solutions are currently not usable on competing platforms   we focus primarily on the market related to personal computers or “pcs” to the extent that there is an even more significant shift by the market from pcs to mobile or tablet devices we could experience a substantial reduction in revenues recently the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than pcs such as mobile phones and tablets has increased dramatically our services are not yet available on these alternative platforms and devices if this trend accelerates and if we fail to successfully develop a mobile offering we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services and our services will become less relevant and may fail to attract advertisers and web traffic   additionally mobile devices are more controlled by the mobile device manufacturers and the providers of their operating systems to the extent that these hardware and software providers use their position to advantage their own or other offerings our opportunities could be more limited   if we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and advertiser needs our solutions may become less competitive or obsolete   the market for display video desktop application mobile application and other online advertising solutions is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate to attract new digital advertisers third party application developers digital publishers and other partners and increase spending by our existing advertisers we will need to expand and enhance our solutions to meet advertiser needs add functionality and address technological advancements if we fail to develop new solutions that address our advertisers’ needs or fail to enhance and improve our solutions in a timely manner or conform to industry standards we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market acceptance of our solutions and our solutions may become less competitive or obsolete   our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future technologies if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver advertising solutions at lower prices or more efficiently or effectively than our solutions such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete keeping pace with new and changing technology and evolving industry standards may require significant expenditures of financial and other resources we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful   a loss of the services of our senior management and other key personnel could adversely affect the execution of our business strategy   we depend on the continued services of our senior management team the loss of the services of these personnel could create a gap in management and could result in the loss of expertise necessary for us to execute our business strategy and thereby adversely affect our business            further our ability to execute our business strategy also depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified and skilled technical and creative personnel and skilled management marketing and sales personnel competition for wellqualified employees in our industry is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to retain existing key employees and to attract new skilled employees as well if we cannot attract and retain additional key employees or lose one or more of our current key employees our ability to develop or market our products and attract or acquire new users could be adversely affected although we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly senior management we cannot be assured that we will be able to retain the services of senior management or other key employees or that we will be able to attract new employees in the future who are capable of making significant contributions   our substantial debt and deferred obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations   as of december   we had indebtedness and other commitments that principally consisted of  for our term loan bearing interest at approximately  per annum and  for our revolving loan bearing interest at  per annum for loans based upon the libor and  per annum for reference rate loans in addition we have  which can be satisfied with cash or stock as per the terms of the exchange agreement and  of deferred payment obligations to the transferors and a  obligation due to the lenders pursuant to the financing agreement we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sufficient earnings to cover fixed charges in future years if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks for us could intensify   our substantial debt and other commitments could have important consequences in particular it could   ● require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other commitments in addition to interest payments we are required to pay  at the end of each quarter as a principal reduction on our term loan thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes       ● limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our indebtedness among other things our ability to borrow additional funds       ● limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate       ● increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and       ● place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt   our debt agreements contain restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities and failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our business   the financing agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things   ● incur or guarantee additional debt or incur or suffer to exist additional liens       ● merge with another entity or dispose of our assets       ● change the nature of our business       ● make capital expenditures in excess of certain limits       ● make certain payments and distributions and       ● make certain investments            in addition the financing agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a certain total leverage ratio as defined in the financing agreement as of each calendar quarter end under this covenant we were required to maintain a total leverage ratio of no more than  as of december   our total leverage ratio as of such date was  the total leverage ratio that we must maintain decreases in each of the next five quarters from  as of march   to  as of march   and remains at  for each quarter thereafter if we were to default on this financial covenant such default if not waived by our lenders could severely limit our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital that we might need to maintain and grow our business could restrict our opportunities to participate in mergers and acquisitions and potentially constrain our ability to cost effectively execute on our business plan furthermore we are dependent upon our lenders for our revolving borrowing arrangement which we rely upon as a source of borrowing for our operations if we do not maintain compliance with the financial covenant under the financing agreement we may lose our ability to draw upon the revolver arrangement and the lenders may accelerate our obligation to repay the amounts due should the funding under the financing agreement become unavailable to us we may not be able to find alternative sources of financing and we may not be able to pay our liabilities and expenses when due which could result in the suspension of some or all of our current operations it could also adversely affect the willingness of our vendors and employees to continue to work with us    our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control complying with these covenants also may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default under the terms of such agreements which could result in an acceleration of repayment failure to maintain existing financing or to secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position   if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the financing agreement there could be a default under the terms of the agreement in such event or if we are otherwise in default under the financing agreement including pursuant to the crossdefault provisions of the financing agreement the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable furthermore our lenders could foreclose on their security interests in our assets including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries borrowings under any other debt instruments of ours that contain crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable if any of those events occur our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing even if we could obtain alternative financing it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us additionally we may not be able to amend the financing agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position   if our lenders foreclose on their security interests in our assets they will have the right to sell those assets in order to satisfy our obligations to them   our obligations under the financing agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries in the event of foreclosure liquidation bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding relating to us or to our subsidiaries that have guaranteed our debt the lenders will have prior claims on our assets those claims include the right to foreclose and take possession of our assets including equipment that is necessary for the conduct of our operations which would restrict our ability to continue to conduct business there can be no assurance that we would receive any proceeds from a foreclosure sale of our assets that constitute collateral following the satisfaction of the secured lenders’ priority claims            we rely on our outsourced technology development partner for our software and technology development services and support   much of our technology and development is conducted through a consulting arrangement with bravo studio doo pursuant to the consulting arrangement bravo studio doo provides us with ongoing software and technology development services and support the consulting arrangement is terminable by either party upon  days’ prior written notice to the other party if bravo studio doo were to terminate our relationship we would be adversely and materially affected and our revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted   we have a few key vendors from whom we obtain necessary services to continue our business which may adversely affect our ability to replace such vendors and minimize our costs   we have a few key vendors from whom we obtain necessary services to continue to efficiently and effectively operate our business for example our three largest cost of revenue vendors accounted for   and  of our cost of revenues for the year ended december   there were no cost of revenue vendors which accounted for  or more of our cost of revenues for the year ended december   such concentration exposes us to increased risk in the event any one of these vendors becomes unable or unwilling to provide us with the services we need or significantly increases the cost of such services in such event we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find a replacement vendor to provide services on terms comparable to our current arrangements if our vendor costs increase we may be required pass the increased cost on to our clients which may harm our competitive position the inability to replace our key vendors or significant increases in cost for the services provided by our key vendors would adversely and materially affect our revenues and results of operations   our business depends on our ability to collect and use data to deliver ads and to disclose data relating to the performance of our ads and any limitation on these practices could significantly diminish the value of our solutions and cause us to lose customers and revenue   our ability to optimize the placement and scheduling of advertisements for our advertisers and the targeting of advertisements and accordingly our ability to grow our revenue depends on our ability to successfully leverage certain data that we collect our ability to successfully leverage such data in turn depends on our ability to collect and obtain rights to utilize such data this data includes data from advertisers and device users and it also includes data from our publishers and third parties such as data providers when we deliver an ad to an internetconnected device we are able to collect information about the placement of the ad and the interaction of the user with the ad such as whether the user clicked on an ad visited a landing page or watched a video we are also able to collect information about the user’s ip address device and some demographic characteristics we may also contract with one or more third parties to obtain additional anonymous information about the user who is viewing a particular ad including information about the user’s interests as we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of ad impressions we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and scheduling of ads across the advertising opportunities available to us any interruptions failures or defects in our data collection mining analysis and storage systems could limit our ability to aggregate and analyze user data from our clients’ advertising campaigns if that happens we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertisers which could make our solutions less valuable and as a result we may lose clients and our revenue may decline            our business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities restrictions on our business or reputational harm as a result of evolving governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection   in the course of providing our solutions we transmit and store information related to internetconnected devices user activity and the ads and other content we place federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use processing retention sharing and security of data that we collect across our solutions the us government including the ftc and the department of commerce has also announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices the ftc has also adopted revisions to the children’s online privacy protection act that expand liability for the collection of information by operators of websites and other electronic solutions that are directed to children   we strive to comply with all applicable laws regulations policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data collection processing use and disclosure however the applicability of specific laws may be unclear in some cases and domestic and foreign government regulation and enforcement of data practices and data tracking technologies is expansive not clearly defined and rapidly evolving in addition it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is new or inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices complying with any new regulatory requirements could also force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could reduce our revenue or compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with us federal state or international laws including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection or disclosure or unauthorized access by third parties to this information could result in proceedings or actions including class actions against us by governmental entities private parties or others any such proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation result in significant expense to defend distract our management increase our costs of doing business adversely affect the demand for our solutions and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability we may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our clients from the costs or consequences of litigation resulting from using our solutions or from the disclosure of confidential information which could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue   the data we collect from consumers advertisers and publishers may decrease which may make our solutions less valuable and adversely affect our business   we participate in industry selfregulatory programs under which in addition to other compliance obligations we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising in addition consumers can currently opt out of the placement or use of our cookies for online targeted advertising purposes by either deleting or disabling cookies on their browsers visiting websites that allow consumers to place an optout cookie on their browsers which instructs advertisers and their service providers not to use certain data about the consumer’s online activity for the delivery of targeted advertising or by downloading browser plugins and other tools that can be set to  identify cookies and other tracking technologies used on websites  prevent websites from placing thirdparty cookies and other tracking technologies on the consumer’s browser or  block the delivery of online advertisements on websites and applications if there is a material increase in the number of consumers who choose to opt out or are otherwise using browsers where they need to and fail to configure the browser to accept cookies or similar tracking technologies our ability to collect valuable and actionable data may be impaired which may make our solutions less valuable and adversely affect our business   furthermore in order to effectively operate our advertising campaigns we collect data from advertisers publishers and other third parties if we are not able to obtain sufficient rights to data from these third parties we may not be able to utilize such data in our solutions although our arrangements with advertisers and publishers generally permit us to collect nonpersonally identifiable and aggregate data from advertising campaigns sometimes an advertiser or publisher declines to permit the use of this data for example publishers may not agree to permit us to place our data collection tags on their sites or agree to provide us with the data generated by interactions with the content on their sites the inability to collect or use data from advertisers and publishers may limit the usefulness of the data that we do collect and use in addition advertisers may request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other advertisers’ campaign data it would be difficult if not impossible to comply with these requests and complying with these kinds of requests could cause us to spend significant amounts of resources interruptions failures or defects in our data collection mining analysis and storage systems as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection use and processing of data could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze the data from our customers’ advertising campaigns if that happens we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertising customers which could make our solutions less valuable and as a result we may lose customers and our revenue may decline            new laws and regulations applicable to internet advertising privacy and data collection and protection and uncertainties regarding the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could harm our business   our business is conducted through the internet and therefore among other things we are subject to the laws and regulations that apply to online businesses around the world these laws and regulations are becoming more prevalent in the united states europe and elsewhere and may impede the growth of internet marketing and consequently our services these regulations and laws may cover user privacy data collection and protection content use of “cookies” access changes “net neutrality” pricing intellectual property distribution protection of minors consumer protection and taxation   many areas of the law affecting the internet remain largely unsettled even in areas where there has been legislative action this uncertainty can be compounded when services hosted in one jurisdiction are directed at users in another jurisdiction therefore it is difficult to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property privacy and data collection and protection libel marketing data security and taxation apply to the internet and our business   if we fail to detect fraud or other actions that impact ad campaign performance we could lose the confidence of advertisers or agencies which would cause our business to suffer   our business relies on effectively and efficiently delivering advertising campaigns for advertisers we may in the future be subject to fraudulent and malicious activities such as the use of bots nonhuman traffic delivered by machines that are designed to simulate human users and artificially inflate user traffic these activities could overstate the performance of any given ad campaign and could harm our reputation it may be difficult to detect fraudulent or malicious activity because we do not rely solely on our own content and rely in part on publisher partners for controls with respect to such activity while we routinely assess the campaign performance on our digital media properties’ websites and our partner publishers’ websites such assessments may not detect or prevent fraudulent or malicious activity if fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others and we fail to detect or prevent it the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment and our reputation may be harmed high levels of fraudulent or malicious activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our solutions refusals to pay refund demands or withdrawal of future business if we fail to detect fraud or other actions that impact the performance of our ad campaigns we could lose the confidence of our advertisers or agencies which could cause our business to suffer   technological errors and system failures could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose clients   our success depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our solutions which we utilize to place advertisements monitor the performance of advertising campaigns manage our ad opportunities and content inventory and respond to advertiser publisher third party application developer and other partner needs our revenue depends on our ability to categorize video content deliver ads and other content and target as well as measure ad campaigns on a realtime basis factors that may adversely affect the performance of our solutions include   ● inability to accurately process data and extract meaningful insights and trends            ● faulty or outofdate algorithms that fail to properly process data or result in inability to capture brandreceptive audiences at scale       ● technical or infrastructure problems causing advertisements not to function display properly or be placed next to inappropriate context       ● inability to control video completion rates maintain user attention or prevent end users from skipping advertisements and       ● unavailability of standard digital video audience ratings and brand receptivity measurements for brand advertisers to effectively measure the success of their campaigns   sustained or repeated technological errors or system failures that interrupt our ability to deliver advertisements and provide access to our solutions including technological failures affecting our ability to deliver advertising quickly and accurately and to process viewers’ responses to video content or fill publisher content requests could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our solutions and reduce our revenue any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not be successful in preventing technological errors and system failures any such technological errors or system failures could harm our ability to attract potential clients and retain and expand business with existing clients and as a result our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected   defects or errors in our solutions could harm our reputation result in significant costs to us impair our ability to deliver advertising campaigns and impair our ability to meet our obligations to our partners publishers and content providers   the technology underlying our solutions including our proprietary technology and technology provided by thirdparties may contain material defects or errors that can adversely affect our ability to operate our business and cause significant harm to our reputation this risk is compounded by the complexity of the technology underlying our solutions and the large amounts of data we utilize although we test technologies before incorporating them into our solutions we cannot guarantee that all of the technologies that we incorporate will not contain errors bugs or other defects errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems in our solutions could result in the incomplete or inaccurate delivery of an ad campaign or other content including serving an ad campaign in an incomplete or inaccurate manner any such failure malfunction or disruption in service could result in damage to our reputation our clients withholding payment to us advertisers third party application developers other partners publishers content providers or other partners making claims or initiating litigation against us and our giving credits to our clients toward future services   we depend on third party internet and telecommunication providers to operate our business temporary failure of these services including catastrophic or technological interruptions would reduce our revenues and damage our reputation and securing alternate sources for these services could significantly increase our expenses   each of our third party internet and telecommunication providers may not continue to provide services to us without disruptions in services at the current cost or at all moreover as technology advances occur we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructure and technologies although there may be overlap between the companies that provide such services any such disruption in services even if temporary may negatively impact our performance   our servers and communications systems could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause deterioration in performance or interruption in these systems delays loss of critical data and lost revenues further because our california headquarters and server location site are in seismically active areas earthquakes present a particular serious risk of business disruption            security breaches computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations   we collect store and transmit advertising information relating to our audience advertisers third party application developers publishers content providers and other partners and we store information about our employees and the company such as contracts and company confidential information we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of such information but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems or those of our information technology vendors in the future security breaches computer viruses or other harmful software code and computer hacking attacks could result in the unauthorized disclosure misuse or loss of information legal claims and litigation indemnity obligations regulatory fines and penalties contractual obligations and liabilities and other liabilities in addition if our security measures or those of our vendors are breached or unauthorized access to data otherwise occurs our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and advertisers third party application developers publishers content providers and other partners may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions a government entity may bring a claim for inadequate data protection and our own employees may bring claims against our company for breaches of confidentiality any of the foregoing could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue   our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our services weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue   we regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success we strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on contractual restrictions we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure and use of our intellectual property and proprietary information however these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others in addition we have licensed in the past and may license in the future some of our proprietary rights to third parties these licensees may take unauthorized actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation  we may in the future seek to protect our intellectual property in new ways such as by registering our trademarks and copyrights or applying for patents for technology we develop effective trade secret copyright trademark domain name and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights protecting our intellectual property through federal and state filings in the future may prove expensive and timeconsuming   monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property further we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitors may also independently develop similar technology the laws in the united states and elsewhere change rapidly and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features which could significantly reduce demand for our solutions in addition we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation litigation whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant can be expensive timeconsuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel which could harm our business whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us in addition litigation is inherently uncertain and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights            our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our solutions or another aspect of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of others   companies in the online advertising industry are often required to defend against litigation claims that are based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights our success depends in part upon noninfringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences in the future we may face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights such claims may be made by competitors or other parties regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or infringing or misappropriating other intellectual property rights have any merit these claims are timeconsuming and costly to evaluate and defend and can impose a significant burden on management and employees the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and we may receive unfavorable interim or preliminary rulings in the course of litigation there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases we may decide to settle lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and are able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights could   ● subject us to significant liabilities for monetary damages which may be tripled in certain instances and the attorneys’ fees of others       ● prohibit us from developing commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our solutions unless we obtain licenses from and pay royalties to the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all       ● subject us to indemnification obligations or obligations to refund fees to and adversely affect our relationships with our current or future advertisers agencies third party application developers publishers content providers and other partners       ● result in injunctive relief against us or otherwise result in delays or stoppages in providing all or certain aspects of our solutions       ● cause advertisers agencies third party application developers publishers content providers and other partners to avoid working with us       ● divert the attention and resources of management and technical personnel and       ● require technology or branding changes to our solutions that would cause us to incur substantial cost and that we may be unable to execute effectively or at all   we rely on data other technology and intellectual property licensed from other parties the failure or loss of which could increase our costs and delay or prevent the delivery of our solutions   we utilize various types of data other technology and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in order to provide certain elements of our solutions licensed technology data and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these on commercially reasonable terms or at all could result in delays in producing or delivering our solutions until equivalent data other technology or intellectual property is identified and integrated which delays could harm our business in this situation we would be required to either redesign our solutions to function with technology data or intellectual property available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves which would result in increased costs furthermore we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future solutions if we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these technology or intellectual property licenses we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to develop similar or replacement technology or to license and integrate a functional equivalent of the technology or intellectual property the occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results            our business will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions   part of our overall growth strategy is to acquire businesses personnel and technologies that are complementary to our existing business and expand our employee base and the breadth of our offerings our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of suitable acquisition and investment candidates at an acceptable cost our ability to compete effectively to attract these candidates and the availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions future acquisitions or investments could result in potential dilutive issuances of equity securities use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce the intended benefits   integration of a new company’s operations assets and personnel into ours will require significant attention from our management the diversion of our management’s attention away from our business and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our ability to manage our business future acquisitions will also expose us to potential risks including risks associated with any acquired liabilities the integration of new operations technologies and personnel unforeseen or hidden liabilities information security vulnerabilities the diversion of resources from our existing businesses sites and technologies the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions and potential loss of or harm to our relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers as a result of the integration of new businesses   we may need additional capital in the future to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives additional capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all which could compromise our ability to meet our financial obligations and grow our business   we may need additional capital in the future to expand our marketing and sales and technology development efforts to make acquisitions or to pay the  of deferred payment obligations to the transferors under the exchange agreement and to refinance our term loan obligations which become due on january   additional financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund the expansion of our marketing and sales and technology development efforts or take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities which could harm our business and results of operations   financing if any may be in the form of debt or additional sales of equity securities including common or preferred stock the incurrence of debt or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations any of which may be burdensome to us the sale of equity securities including common or preferred stock would result in dilution to the current stockholders’ ownership   our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic conditions   in the event that the united states andor europe experiences an economic downturn or the current economic climate worsens our advertisers’ ability to spend on internet advertising could be reduced a reduction in spending on internet advertising could reduce the use of our products and services which would adversely impact our sales and revenue generation margins and operating expenses and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition            geopolitical uncertainties and instabilities may have negative impacts on our ability to operate andor grow   as we expand our business globally we depend on a stable geopolitical environment in the regions in which we operate should there be instabilities in regions where we sell wish to sell or have outsourced development operations we may find it difficult to maintain or grow our business as we expand our advertiser base to cover asia the middle east africa and latin america geopolitical instabilities could have an adverse impact on our business additionally we outsource our technology development to an engineering firm located in bosnia and herzegovina the region has a history of geopolitical unrest and should a period of instability ensue our technology development capabilities could be jeopardized   risks related to our company and our securities   the majority of our common stock is beneficially owned by certain former members of propel media which makes it possible for them to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval this control may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders   certain former members of propel media including jared pobre our chairman of the board collectively own approximately  of our outstanding common stock as a result of their stock ownership these former members of propel media will be able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including but not limited to   ● the election of directors       ● mergers consolidations or acquisitions the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure and       ● our liquidation winding up and dissolution   the interests of these former members of propel media may not be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders in these matters in addition this concentration of stock ownership may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders such persons’ stock ownership also may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price   furthermore under the stockholders’ agreement entered into between us and these former members of propel media as long as these former members own at least  of our outstanding common stock they will have the right to designate a majority of the directors of our board and as long as they own at least  of our outstanding common stock they will have the right to designate at least  of the directors of our board as a result of their right to designate a majority of the directors these former members of propel media will have even greater influence over the management of our business   we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future accordingly any return on your investment will occur only through appreciation of our common stock   we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future we expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business in addition the financing agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common stock therefore any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates            an active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained which could affect your ability to sell our common stock or depress the market price of our common stock   shares of our common stock are quoted on the otc pink market however an active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained which could affect your ability to sell or depress the market price of our common stock we are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will develop or will be sustained   the public price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile   the price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include   ● general market and economic conditions and market trends including in the digital media advertising industry and the financial markets generally       ● the political economic and social situation in the united states including privacy laws       ● actual or expected variations in operating results       ● announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures capital commitments or other business developments       ● adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate       ● operations and stock performance of competitors       ● litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries       ● recruitment or departure of key personnel       ● purchase or sales of blocks of our common stock and       ● operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable to us   there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly the stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance the market prices of stock in technology and advertising companies have been especially volatile you should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of the common stock is low   we will have the ability to issue “blank check” preferred stock which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock   our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue  shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock the terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock            the requirements of being a public company including the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of  may strain our resources and distract our management and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or costeffective manner   prior to the transactions neither we nor propel media had any history operating as a public company following consummation of the transactions as a public company we and our subsidiaries including propel media are required to comply with certain laws and regulations and reporting requirements that are not applicable to private companies including the reporting obligations of the exchange act certain corporate governance provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of  the doddfrank act and other laws regulations and rules of the sec in order to maintain compliance with these laws rules and regulations we must among other things   ● maintain a more comprehensive compliance function       ● design establish evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  and the related rules and regulations of the sec and the public company accounting oversight board       ● establish and maintain internal policies such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading       ● prepare and file periodic and annual reports and       ● disseminate material information about our company   if we are unable to maintain compliance with our public reporting requirements or the other requirements that apply to public companies we may be subject to sanction or investigation by the sec in addition we incur significant expense to comply with these statutes regulations and requirements as a result of expenses associated with director and officer liability insurance investor relations audit work legal counsel regulatory requirements and the establishment and maintenance of heightened corporate governance measures and management oversight in addition compliance occupies a significant portion of our board of directors’ and management’s time   our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act could result in a restatement of its financial statements cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price   as a public company our internal accounting controls including those applicable to our subsidiaries are required to meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports to help mitigate the risk of fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company as a public company we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and the related rules and regulations of the sec and the public company accounting oversight board furthermore we are required to include in this form k and in our future annual reports an assessment by our management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and if we cease to be a nonaccelerated filer as defined under rules and regulations of the sec a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that attests to our internal control over financial reporting the requirement for a report by our independent registered public accounting firm will apply starting with the annual report for the first fiscal year in which we have a public float of at least  as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year   in performing the required tests under section  of the sarbanesoxley act with respect to internal control over financial reporting we may identify significant deficiencies or errors that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance in such event we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue a favorable assessment if either our management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our company which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock and cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations which in turn could impact our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future if we fail to implement the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act with respect to internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner we may also be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec in addition testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting can divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to our business            we are not subject to certain corporate governance requirements applicable to listed companies   because our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange we are not subject to corporate governance requirements that are applicable to listed companies for instance we are not required to have a majority of independent directors a separate audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors or a separate compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors in addition we are not required to have our board nominees selected or recommended for the board’s selection either by a nominating committee comprised entirely of independent directors or by a majority of our independent directors accordingly our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to the corporate governance requirements applicable to listed companies   item b unresolved staff comments   none   item  properties   propel currently maintains its

proceedings   from time to time we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business other than as set forth below at december   there were no pending legal proceedings to which the company was a party or to which any of its property was subject that were expected individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on us   in december  an action entitled intrepid investments llc “intrepid” v selling source llc “selling source” et al index no  was filed in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york this is an action commenced by intrepid to collect on a junior secured promissory note signed by selling source in the original principal sum of  the “note” the company is not a signatory to the note but kitara media did sign an august   security agreement “security agreement” pledging all of its accounts cash and cash equivalents chattel paper contracts deposit accounts documents equipment fixtures general intangibles all other goods all shares of capital stock of any companies it owned all instruments including all promissory notes all intellectual property all insurance policies and all proceeds thereof all inventory all other investment property all letter of credit rights all other tangible and intangible personal property and all proceeds of any of the foregoing as security for the note at the time kitara media signed the security agreement it was whollyowned by selling source on july   kitara media merged with one of kitara’s then whollyowned subsidiaries with kitara media surviving the merger and becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of kitara accordingly it is no longer whollyowned by selling source although it is still an affiliate of selling source in the action intrepid seeks to foreclose on the security interest both selling source’s and kitara media’s obligations to intrepid under the note and security agreement were subordinate to obligations selling source had to two groups of prior lenders “senior lenders” the right of intrepid to compel payments under the note andor foreclose the lien created by the security agreement was subject to an intercreditor agreement by and between the senior lenders and intrepid under the terms of the intercreditor agreement intrepid could not take steps to compel selling source to make payment on the note or foreclose the security agreement so long as the obligations to the senior lenders remained outstanding in addition under the terms of the intercreditor agreement the senior lenders had the right to have the lien released on any of the collateral pledged as security under the security agreement in the new york action intrepid has challenged the senior lenders’ authority to release the lien and also challenged the enforceability of the intercreditor agreement generally  the court has not yet ruled on the merits of that challenge  in addition selling source’s obligations to the senior lenders remains outstanding            the second matter is intrepid investments llc v selling source llc et al index no  which was filed in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york this matter was originally limited to claims asserted by intrepid against selling source regarding an earnout calculation entered into between it and selling source and confirmed by an arbitrator earlier this year in august  intrepid amended its complaint to include various breach of contractor claims against a variety of those defendants including kitara the new defendants including kitara answered the amended complaint on november   denying liability for all claims on february   the court entered an order granting selling source’s motion to affirm the arbitration results on march   selling source filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of eleven of intrepid’s remaining claims and in september  the new york supreme court granted this motion for summary judgment the claims asserted against kitara were not among those addressed in selling source’s motion   based on these facts propel believes intrepid’s claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously in any event selling source has acknowledged an obligation to indemnify and defend kitara media from any liability to intrepid arising out of the note and security agreement the parties have exchanged pleadings and selling source has provided documents and written interrogating responses to intrepid   item  mine safety disclosures   not applicable            part ii   item  market for registrant’s

principally the result of our success in shifting our user base mix during  we were aggressive in developing our owned and operated user audience which we have grown through our own media buying activities advertising served to this owned and operated audience yields higher margins due to its higher audience quality attributes including higher clickthroughs and audience profiles aligning with advertiser requirements the growth in the owned and operated audience helped us replace revenues earned on advertising served to users through third party application partners which declined during the year ended december    and  of our revenues were from advertising served to our owned and operated user audience and to our third party application partner user audience respectively during the year ended december    and  of our revenues were from advertising served to our owned and operated user audience and to third party application partner user audience respectively   in april  as part of a strategic plan designed to improve operational and cost efficiencies the company completed a workforce reduction and the consolidation of office facilities this restructuring reduced our  employee expenses by approximately  these savings were offset by onetime charges of  for severance and  stockbased compensation for accelerated vesting of certain stock options in connection with the restructuring we reduced certain technology development costs within our publisher business resulting in improvements of approximately  in our profit during    our revenue for the year ended december   was  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended december   our  revenue decrease was principally on account of the shift of the sources of our user audience although our owned and operated audience has been growing through  and  that growth was not able to outpace the declines in the third party application partners’ user audience and the effects on our revenues from cuts made to remove certain unprofitable publisher accounts during the fourth quarter of  we saw a leveling of revenue from advertising served through third party application partners in the fourth quarter of  revenues

december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   as disclosed above the decline in revenue was principally on account of a yearoveryear decline in the user audience to whom we serve advertisements during the year ended december   revenue from our owned and operated user base increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december   during the year ended december   revenue from our third party application partners’ user base declined by  or  to  from  during the year ended december   the decline in the third party application user base was principally on account of policy changes regarding the distribution of applications instituted by those who operate the marketplace’s largest web browsers which significantly impacted the user acquisition strategy of our third party application partners and limited the ability of these third party application partners to acquire users the revenue growth from our owned and operated properties was based first upon our significant emphasis placed on media buying efforts and related enhanced content offers to draw users deemed highly desirable to our advertisers to our properties and second upon effectively serving more targeted advertising to those users we have realized higher advertiser demand for our owned and operated user audience and as a result we have been able to realize a greater overall return or higher lifetime value from our media buy spend to acquire these users this growth in our owned and operated user audience has lessened our dependency on the lower lifetime value users from our third party application partners third party application partners’ user were largely concentrated in international markets and our international revenue decreased significantly due to the decrease in users in such markets revenues attributable to the user base of our domestic third party application partners stabilized albeit at a lower level in the fourth quarter of  lastly the remaining decline in revenue of  was from our publisherbased video syndication business where we made cuts to narrow our offerings to reposition and improve the profitability of this publisherbased sector of our business as of december   the company’s overall revenue trend is stable and we believe it provides a good foundation for growth in    gross profit   gross profit for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   as discussed above during the year ended december   our revenues declined by  or  however our cost of revenues decreased by  or  over the same period driving our gross margin to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   this increase in gross margin percentage was attributable principally to the higher yield or lifetime value earned on the owned and operated audience base as compared to the yield earned on the less profitable user audience base of the third party application partners as well as to a reduction during the year ended december   of approximately  in media and publisher costs on account of the sale of our health guru operation and our cuts made in the video syndication business as our user audience has shifted substantially to that of our owned and operated properties and away from that of our third partly application partners our costs of revenues and gross profit are increasingly sensitive to our media buy spending to draw user audience to our owned and operated properties rather than the costs of the commissions paid to the third party application partners based directly on ads served by us to the users from the third party application partners            operating income   operating income for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was principally on account of a decline in gross profit of  as discussed above offset by a reduction in operating expenses of  due principally to the april  operating restructuring and related workforce reductions   cost of revenues   cost of revenues for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease for the year ended december   was attributable principally to the shift in spending for user acquisition toward media buy spending to grow our owned and operated properties and away from commissions paid for third party application partners as a result for the year ended december   commissions paid to our third party application partners declined by  or  to  and publisher ad serving video costs declined by  to  on account of the sale of our health guru operation and our cuts made in the video syndication business these reductions were offset by an increase of  to  in domestic media buying costs incurred in support of our owned and operated user audience   salaries commissions benefits and related expenses   salaries commissions benefits and related expenses for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease for the year ended december   was due to reductions of approximately  in salary and related benefit costs savings principally in connection with the april  workforce reductions offset by related increased severance costs of  and accelerated stockbased compensation of    technology development and maintenance expenses   technology development and maintenance expenses for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease was principally due to an optimization of technology resources to support our revenue and media buying initiatives   other costs and operating expenses   other costs and operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative and professional services for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   of the total decrease  was due to lower rent bad debt travel and office expenses resulting in part from our april  operational restructuring and the closing of our offices in new york and new jersey we also realized decreases in legal accounting and tax service fees of  which were higher during the year ended december   in support of our merger and becoming a public company   depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december   increased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   the increase was principally a result of amortization for capitalized software for a large project being placed in service and amortized in connection with the company’s ongoing technology development            impairment of software and intangible assets   impairment charges for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease was a result of an  impairment during  as a result of writing off the carrying amounts of health guru media’s software and video library due to declines in the performance of the related business during  the company recorded a full impairment in the amount of  for the trade name acquired in connection with the reverse merger with kitara   other income expense   interest expense net decreased by  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease was principally due to the decrease in the balances of the term loan and revolving loan the decrease in interest expense also reflects the benefit of a onetime favorable interest reduction of  from the lenders related to the revolver   on june   our former chief executive officer forgave a promissory note due from the company to him on january   as a result we recognized a gain of  from the extinguishment of debt   net income   net income for the year ended december   was  as compared to net income of  for the year ended december   income before income tax expense was  for the year ended december   as compared to income before income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   the decrease in the income before income tax expense of  during the year ended december   was principally on account of a decline in operating income of  offset by a decrease in interest and other incomeexpense net of  the  income tax expense includes a charge of  principally to reflect adjustments to the deferred asset accounts for updated estimated state apportionment factors for future state income taxes the  income tax benefit was principally to recognize deferred tax assets for the step up in basis for income tax purposes in connection with the change in income tax status of propel media the decrease in net income for the year ended december   was primarily to the increase in income tax expense   adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure     in addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we present adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap measure adjusted ebitda which is based upon the adjusted ebitda which we report to our lenders and is a key measurement monitored by management and is determined by taking net loss income and adding interest taxes depreciation amortization impairment charges stock based compensation bank fees losses from extraordinary unusual or nonrecurring items noncash items merger and other onetime expenses and severance we believe that this nongaap measure viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported gaap results provides useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results the nongaap measure presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies please refer to page  for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income   adjusted ebitda for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december   overall the decrease in adjusted ebitda was principally due to the decrease of  in gross profit which was offset by the decrease of operating expenses by             liquidity and capital resources   as of december   our cash on hand was  and we had a working capital deficit of  we recorded net income of  for year ended december   reflecting an income before income tax of  less income tax expense of    we have relied on cash flows provided by operations to fund operations and operating obligations as discussed above we have been growing our owned and operated user audience which has been helping us to grow our revenues we have also lowered our operating costs which have helped to soften the impact from our lower revenues as a result our adjusted ebitda has improved over the four calendar quarters of    we are a party to the financing agreement with kitara and propel media as borrowers certain of their subsidiaries as guarantors and with certain lenders the financing agreement provides us with the term loan and the revolving loan   as of december   we had indebtedness and other commitments that principally consisted of  for our term loan bearing interest at approximately  per annum and  for our revolving loan bearing interest at  per annum for loans based upon the libor and  per annum for reference rate loans in addition we have  which can be satisfied with cash or stock as per the terms of the exchange agreement and  which can be satisfied only with cash as per the terms of the exchange agreement of deferred payment obligations to the transferors mr jared pobre one of the former members of propel media on behalf of the transferors is permitted to elect during the ten day period following each december st commencing december   to receive any unpaid amount of such  deferred obligation in shares of the company’s common stock in addition we have a  obligation due to the lenders pursuant to the financing agreement we are obligated under our financing agreement to fund a principal reduction of  at the end of each calendar quarter our term loan matures in january  amounts due to the transferors are due in  as well as the  payment due to the lenders pursuant to the financing agreement   as of december   there was an outstanding balance of  and the borrowing base under the revolving loan was approximately  as of december   there was capacity of  to be drawn under the revolving loan   the financing agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a total leverage ratio as of each calendar quarter end total leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of certain debt on such date to adjusted ebitda as defined for the trailing month period under this covenant we were required to maintain a total leverage ratio of no more than  as of december   our total leverage ratio as of such date was  the balance of our term loan decreases at the end of each calendar quarter as we remit a principal reduction of  each quarter the total leverage ratio that we must maintain decreases in each of the next five quarters from  as of march   to  for march   and remains at  for each quarter thereafter the financing agreement also contains negative covenants that among other things i limit the amount we may invest in capital improvements ii limit the amount we may incur in additional debt and iii require the delivery of certain periodic financial statements and an operating budget   we are currently in compliance and as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the financing agreement and other loan documents however our business financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause us to fail to meet such covenants readers are cautioned to review the risks set forth in the section titled “risk factors” for information relating to the risks surrounding our continued compliance with such covenants            management believes that the company’s cash balances on hand cash flows expected to be generated from operations and borrowings available under the company’s revolving loan will be sufficient to fund the company’s net cash requirements through march     net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of cash inflow from accounts receivable in conjunction with the reversemerger in year    net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in investing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   compared to  provided by investing activities for the year ended december   the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   is principally attributable to the purchases of

acquired in connection with the reverse merger with kitara media corp offset by purchases of property and equipment   net cash used in financing activities   net cash used in financing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   during the year ended december   cash flows used in financing activities consisted of a  principal reduction of the term loan and net repayments of  under the revolving loan during the year ended december   cash flows from financing activities consisted principally of the financing through the financing agreement offset by the amounts funded to the transferors   offbalance sheet arrangements   the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements   critical account policies and estimates   revenue recognition   we generate revenue from advertisers by serving our ads to a user audience consisting of our private owned and operated memberbased network users of our third party application partners’ properties and users from our publisherbased traffic in all cases our revenue is generated when an advertisement is served by us or when a user action occurs based on the

accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense are computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three years for computer equipment and purchased software three to five years for furniture and equipment the shorter of the useful life and the term of the lease for leasehold improvements   we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment longlived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic  “property plant and equipment” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability   we capitalize certain costs related to our software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with asc  costs related to preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities are expensed as incurred internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage including upgrades and enhancements representing modifications that will result in significant additional functionality are capitalized  software maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment and are amortized on a straightline basis over the software’s estimated useful life we evaluate these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets   in accordance with asc  “accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed” software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility generally in the form of a working model has been established research and development costs which consist primarily of salaries and fees paid to third parties for the development of software and applications are expensed as incurred we capitalize only those costs directly attributable to the development of the software capitalization of these costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility activities undertaken after the products are available for release to customers to correct errors or keep the product up to date are expensed as incurred capitalized software development costs will be amortized over the estimated economic life of the software once the product is available for general release to customers capitalized software development costs will be amortized over the greater of the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue for a product or the straightline method we will periodically perform reviews of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs   at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software any remaining capitalized amounts are written off no impairment losses were recognized for the years ended

financial obligations such as customer payment history credit worthiness and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms the company uses assumptions and judgment

for furniture and equipment the shorter of the useful life and the term of the lease for leasehold improvements   the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment longlived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic  “property plant and equipment” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability   intangible assets   the company’s longlived intangible assets other than goodwill are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and assets not acquired in acquisitions were recorded at historical cost however if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount other intangible assets with indefinite life are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment

costs are expensed as incurred capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment and are amortized on a straightline basis over the software’s estimated useful life ranging from  months to  months the company evaluates these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets based upon the decline in performance of the health guru operations the company recorded impairment charges of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively to record the write off of the book value of health guru’s

the fair value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a conclusion that is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount if an entity determines that qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the entity exceeds the carrying amount the two step quantitative evaluation is not necessary under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill   in the event the estimated fair value of the company is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and stockholders equity   on january   in connection with the reverse merger the company used both a discounted cash flows approach and a guideline companies’ model approach to estimate the current fair value of kitara in connection with the reverse business combination of kitara the guideline companies’ method utilizes financial and market data on publicly traded securities of companies engaged in business pursuits similar to those of kitara from which prevailing investor attitudes and expectations are developed differences between the publicly traded companies and kitara are analyzed and considered in order to develop representative market multiples which in turn were applied to kitara’s operating results to develop an indication of value   as of december   the company evaluated goodwill for potential impairment pursuant to the accounting guidance the company elected to initially assess certain qualitative factors in order to determine whether a quantitative analysis was required since the carrying amount of the company’s reporting unit was negative in evaluating the qualitative factors the company was required to determine whether there were any adverse qualitative factors pointing to a conclusion that an impairment of goodwill exists if so then the company would need to conduct the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the amount of impairment if any in its evaluation the company evaluated macroeconomic industry and market conditions trends in financial performance company specific events which might adversely impact the fair value of the reporting unit as well as whether there were any significant differences between the carrying amounts and the estimated fair values of the reporting units assets and liabilities andor the existence of significant unrecognized intangibles based upon this qualitative evaluation the company determined that as of december   in the aggregate such factors did not point to a conclusion that an impairment of goodwill would exist based upon this evaluation the company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of december

merger whereby propel media a limited liability company was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of kitara a c corporation the historical financial statements were those of propel media from the date of the reverse merger the company’s results of operations began to be taxed as a c corporation prior to the reverse merger the company’s operations were taxed as a limited liability company whereby the company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns therefore no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to january     this change in tax status to a taxable entity resulted in the recognition of a net deferred tax asset based on the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company’s assets at the date of the reverse merger this resulted in a deferred tax benefit of  being recognized upon the consummation of the reverse merger and was determined using an effective tax rate of  this tax benefit was principally on account of a step up in basis of

assets and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction a valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used the related valuation allowance on such assets would be reduced tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the company’s tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards as of december   and  no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported the
