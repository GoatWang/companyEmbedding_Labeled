products typically cost more than existing products due to the high costs associated with production and development this is best illustrated by technology products the fact that initial customers will be early adopters of a new product affects the marketing strategy as the product grows and matures the strategy again changes over time marketers lower the price when a product is in the declining stage most competitors leave the market and prices are very low at each stage the marketing of the product is different when a new product is developed and offered a company must consider what will develop the products value to the customer whether the customer is a consumer or another business marketers must always ask where a new product will fit in their current lineup and how the new product will serve as an extension of an existing brand take the car manufacturer bmw they make sporty luxury vehicles aimed at the uppermiddle and wealthy classes developing an inexpensive and lowerquality vehicle to compete with cars in another class may dilute the brand and hurt sales however if bmw were to market the vehicle under a different brand they could diversify their product portfolio avoid the risk of diluting the bmw brand and be able to reach new customers all at the same time some firms go to great lengths to disassociate their brands from one another while others embrace a family of brands model appropriate decisions vary by industry and strategy equally important in delivering value to the customer through an offering is how a company sources the goods and services necessary for production and delivers the end product for customers to purchase  otherwise known as the supply chain finally in this unit we will examine issues in pricing including the costs of delivering a product customer and societal perspectives the impacts of competition and ultimately the revenues a company may generate unit  time advisory completing this unit should take

product and determined appropriate pricing they must decide how to effectively raise awareness and distribute the product this unit will focus on these decisions you will learn that distribution is a complex process that involves taking a product through the manufacturing process shipping to warehouses distributing to sellers and customers and taking returned products marketers must work with supply chain managers to determine the best method to route products if marketers expect that sales will be heavier in the northeast than in the west additional resources will need to be allocated there to meet demand there are a number of strategies for moving a product through various distribution channels these vary based on anticipated demand actual demand and the competition marketers must have a proactive strategy they cannot sit on inventory and wait for orders because inventory storage is expensive and a lack of sales is disruptive the final and arguably most vital aspect of marketing is the actual promotion of the product this can take for the form of giveaways competitions advertising sales and anything else a creative manager can think of marketers must take a number of aspects into consideration however  if you employ a sales staff to promote the product how do you compensate them if you pay a commission how much commission will be paid per unit will the sales staff be given discretion on price or do you want to send a uniform message that the price is locked in if a new company has limited funds available for advertising campaigns might they use public

georgia john burnett’s core concepts of marketing “chapter  channel concepts distributing the product” pdf instructions read chapter  note that the push and pull strategies are based on how the customer perceives a product for example if the company really wants to sell a product it may aggressively push it through the distribution channel and into stores with pricing incentives this strategy is often seen with products for which the customer does not yet have a perceived need or desire a pull strategy is based on satisfying a customer’s want or need it is almost as if the customer is pulling the product through the distribution channel channel membership is a distribution strategy based on the type of product in question if quality and reliability is important marketers will use exclusive distributions ie authorized resellers an intensive distribution is the opposite a marketer will allow just about anyone to carry a product convenience foods are a good

strategies and customer analysis there are factors outside of the company that must be taken into consideration with any marketing strategy though marketers can control how they might respond to customer needs and expectations they face the oftenunpredictable reactions of customers to them maintaining customer satisfaction is essential to sustainable success marketers need to be sensitive to the regulatory and ethical constraints that may be placed upon them by a wide range of domestic and international industry standards and the expectations of society companies must also face social forces that challenge their success for example marketers must be aware of the social and cultural aspects of each region in which they choose to market a product even a worldwide brand such as coca cola must adjust its marketing strategy for every region it enters an awareness of the cultural factors affecting a marketing strategy can make the marketing message much more effective quite often
