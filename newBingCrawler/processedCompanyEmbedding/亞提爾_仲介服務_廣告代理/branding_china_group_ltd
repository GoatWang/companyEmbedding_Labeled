ebook knowledge base my cart product branding – why it matters when buying from china posted on march   by chinaimportal in product guides strategy  processes suggestion watch the  minute video tutorial before reading this article click here to get the starter package all categories dreaming about creating your own clothing line or launching a new brand of weight loss tea the full potential of importing from china can only be achieved if it’s combined with a well laid out branding strategy branding a “made in china” product is in general easy and it barely makes a difference on the bottom line in this article we explain how this can be done and why neglecting this can cost you a fortune why branding makes sense for importing businesses are you a small business owner forget about competing on price with multinationals like wal mart and mediamarkt larger volumes equals lower prices and you won’t get anywhere near those of the mentioned companies besides wal mart can afford to make big mistakes you can’t yet there are huge numbers of small businesses importing from china and still making good profits as a matter of fact quite a lot of products sold by large retailers are imported by small businesses how come the answer is branding a printed logo or a custom designed product packaging communicates a message it tells a story about a company or a product which in turn adds value to the business but who cares about a brand nobody’s ever heard of well it’s not really like that after all global brands like coca cola apple and bmw started from scratch too a brand cannot be well known from day one thus arguing that small and relatively unknown brands are useless makes no sense besides consumers in the eu and us are moving away from big brands to a certain degree smaller brands are often considered more “authentic” well at least among those berlin hipsters and sporting a big ralph lauren logo is considered rather tacky the latter is still cool in china though selling and owning a brand rather than acting as an opportunistic trader makes it possible for a small business to reach a decent profit margin as a matter of fact i think that pretty much all of our really successful clients focus on brand building how a product can be branded i got great news for you branding “made in china” products is actually quite easy and it barely makes a price difference in most cases however a product must be branded before it’s shipped from china therefore branding is part of the manufacturing process branding can also be done in a variety of ways below i explain how your china products can be branded logo printing this one is pretty straight forward you got a product and you want your logo on it most suppliers in industries as diverse as led screens to wristwatches can offer a buyer logo print on the products besides it’s quite cheap while prices still vary depending on the logo size colors and the product itself – the branding cost barely makes a difference on the bottom line most products can be branded with a printed logo for less than us per unit product packaging western customers are spoiled they well that’s us require products to not only fulfill a need but also to be pretty the product packaging is usually the first thing a prospective buyer lays his or her eyes on and we all know how important it is making a good first impression a product packaging can be branded in many different ways the easiest and usually the most cost efficient option is to have a logo printed on a standard product packaging ie noncustom design customized colors are usually available it’s also possible to design product packaging on your own yet it’s not as easy as it might sound customized product packaging may require tooling such as costly injection molds this is always the case when manufacturing custom designed plastic packaging many small businesses import no name products from chinese wholesalers this is a scenario when branded product packing makes a lot of sense it allows the importer to brand a product without actually interfering with the manufacturing process besides certain products look better without logos ie neck ties however a product packaging design must be compliant with relevant product labeling regulations product labeling is often part of product safety directives such as ce in the european union and cpsia in the united states importing products with improper labeling thus non compliant with the applicable labeling regulations may result in a forced recall that’s a serious hit for most small businesses but there’s help to get when you order a starter package we confirm which labeling regulation applies to your product and specify in details what you must know before designing a product packaging click here to read more customized design oem nothing makes a product stand out as much as unique design however developing a product from scratch takes time and requires a certain degree of product knowledge keep in mind that there’s no universal definition of “good quality” instead the importer is required to provide the chinese manufacturer with very clear product specifications these include but are not limited to dimensions colors materials components product certification standards and other quality requirements how to get product branding right things do go wrong when importing from china excitement over a new arrival can quickly be replaced by a sense of desperation when you open a box of iphone cases and the logos are printed on the wrong position in the wrong color and in times new roman – instead of calibri in order to avoid such nightmare scenarios forget about returning anything to china you need to provide your supplier with overly clear instructions and product specifications the problem is that there’s no template that works for all kinds of products and branding options however the fundamentals for a logo print always include the following dimensions color pantone or ral code position type of printing ie engraving or screen print tell your supplier to send at least one branded sample before you pay anything upfront when the production starts it cannot be reversed any misunderstanding between you and the supplier can easily ruin a whole batch of products branding is more than a logo while we’re not a branding agency we’ve spent years participating in the product development process for small to medium sized business i’d say that we have a few things to say about the topic there are various ways to stand out on the market and get the consumer’s attention in my opinion a well designed logo is only the first step kevin ackermann founder of baca jewellery limited in london provides a good example for others to follow the jewellery market is incredibly competitive launching a jewelry brand certainly won’t make the headlines instead of doing what has been done a million times by others or try to compete with swarovski kevin managed to find a unique angle by combining a classic jewellery collection with a charity program that is brand building want some more inspiration you’ll find plenty of interesting success stories at alibaba’s youtube channel you’ll quickly notice that none of these businesses are faceless wholesalers or opportunistic traders but small businesses who’ve managed to build strong brands from scratch do you want to launch your own private label or custom designed product it can be hard to go from a design drawing to finished product to help you manage the entire process – from creating a specification to sampling and quality control – we created a starter package a private label  oem product manufacturer lists b product specification templates c product label samples d tutorials video walkthroughs and task lists that guide you stepbystep through the entire process in addition you can also book quality inspections lab testing and shipping directly from the platform click here to learn more planning

cases art  craft products utility products like pencils  sharpeners erasers ball point pens etc all of these products are already being imported and sold in unorganized market by small business owners

email with more information about how we can help you reply boris september   at  pm  fredrik how would i know what logo dimensions must my sample have before making sample order reply fredrik grönkvist september   at  pm  hello boris assuming it’s not an oem design in which case you are the designer and know the dimensions i’d advice you to order a factory sample before you go for an odm sample factory design with buyer branding not only because it makes it easier to confirm logo dimensions but because logo printing requires tooling costing us to  however if you don’t have this option you can request the supplier to offer you a design draft or confirm dimensions for you reply boris september   at  am  hi fredrik i didn’t know about purchasing tooling does that mean i pay for that tooling i always assume supplier already has it when i see odm mentioned on his page in a situation when supplier doesn’t do i pay for tooling cost which is included in moq already or it’s onetime full payment reply fredrik grönkvist september   at  am  hello boris i was referring to tooling related to the custom logo however you don’t need to pay for injections molds for making the whole item or certain components usually it’s a one time payment and not part of the moq price reply joshua december   at  pm  i’m interested in importing a certain product and putting my logo on it with hopes of building my brand but since anybody can purchase this same product through the supplier if feel like it could water down the uniqueness i’m trying to create whats the point of building up my brand and if someone comes in behind me selling the same product under a different brand or no brand at all you’ve talked about trying to create variation in the product as someone who is new to importing what advice can you give to accomplish this are suppliers apt to changing the sizeshapecolors of their products starting out maybe i should just ignore the fact that this could happen…it’s a big market and people might not notice the duplicate product initially what do you think reply fredrik grönkvist december   at  pm  hello joshua chinese suppliers manufacture according to buyer specifications and have no incentive to not accept changes to an existing products – items that are rarely their own original design to begin with reply samuel january   at  am  hello i work for a marketing firm in nigeria we have a client here that want to celebrate their  years anniversary so am looking at designing some branding items for them i need a branding company that manufacture and

i have to travel to make sure the product is done right thank you very much for any information that you can give me reply mike december   at  am  hi fredrik i have a unique invention that i am in process of obtaining utility and design patents as well as trademarks in us this invention is universally unique and has tremendous potential thus i cannot divulge specifics at this time my question is whether it is worth pursuing intellectual property protection across the globe since it is costly and more importantly time consuming to say the least i ask this because i envision manufacturing in europe or asia china as well as us but i hear too many rumors about unscrupulous manufacturers in china who will undermine your brand and marketing plans by producing  exporting knockoff products i have confidence in having the product manufactured in china by a a wellvested manufacturer but it is the ‘other guys’ that i wish to have legal protection from apologies for the long note … look forward to your reply mike reply ali january   at  pm  hi fredrick i am planning on starting a eshop selling designed clothesprinted casual clothes which i want to purchase and add my labelbrand to them then eventually starting my own clothing line can you help in respect of manufacturers etc reply yvonne thomas may   at  pm  produce your goods elsewhere  terrible human rights abuses in this country and treatment of animals especially dogs sickening produce by paying more make less profit and make high quality high spec clothes for the better off we should all pay more for clothes how do you think china keeps it’s costs down sweatshops child labour in poor conditions that is how reply chinaimportal may   at  am  child labour is not widespread in china if you are truly worried about worker safety you should not focus on china but cambodia and bangladesh a chinese worker gets paid  times as much in the apparel industry as one in bangladesh or cambodia you might want to read this article for more information on this topic httpwwwchinaimportalcomblogsocialcomplianceauditsinmainlandchinainterview reply dwight february   at  am  looks like fredrick has jumped ship so i send this in hope that he is still aboard i wish to product brand but that’s the least of my concerns i live in s korea and can’t for the life of me decide if i should have products shipped to s korea wherein i hold the inventory or have them shipped to a fulfillment center in the usa said product has a mostly western clientele and have the fulfillment center hold inventory ship etc i suppose for product quality concerns s korea would be the correct choice but i’m concerned about the lengthy shipping time from s korea to the west anyone out there is welcome respond to my quandry reply fredrik grönkvist february   at  am  hi dwight if you intend to sell to us customers you should not ship from korea as that may result in your customers being forced to pay customs and other import taxes

yvonne thomas may   at  pm  i want to avoid buying anything made in china or using any ingredients from china no not because i am a snob but because i disapprove of the way they are killing dogs look up the yulin dog festival the dogs are cruelly treated before they are battered to death with sticks dog meat is considered a delicacy by some in this country they are thrown around or several are crammed into a metal cage no water so hot and in pain cause they are pushed up against the cage the video i saw of one being battered made me feel ill i had to stop watching so as difficult as it is i want to buy all non chinese products from now onif it costs twice as much i don’t care  reply chinaimportal may   at  am  well dog meat is only consumed by a minority in china even though it could be a fairly large minority that said the dog festival was heavily criticised by a large part of the population if you are serious about not buying china made products you will not upgrade your phone tv computer or car containing chinese electrical components for a long time reply riquel n may   at  am  this was very helpful it explains that you must have the product branded before it is imported does this mean i cannot have the product imported and then branded in the us it is very hard to contact the direct company of the product i want to brand but is easily accessible thru rd party sites please help reply chinaimportal may   at  am  hi riquel we will contact you by email reply melissa june   at  pm  hi there thank you for all of this helpful information would you be able to provide

way i can get the product manufactured in china but have it branded as made in somewhere else reply chinaimportal november   at  am  hi chinwe made in china country of origin labeling is mandatory in the us which is why many suppliers print it on the package it is not for example mandatory in the eu in africa it comes down to the regulations of the specific country you need to look this up that said it is not wise to brand it as made in another country that is most certainly illegal at best you can take the label off reply kenyatta february   at  pm  hi im looking to start a small business selling branded products that will include the company’s logo and design printed onto it i would also like for these items to be packaged and include a barcode so that i can distribute it professionally how much would a job like this nature cost reply brandon march   at  pm  hello thank you for all your information and replies to everyone and willingness to help i have a very simple

 the growth of branding in china strategyapac   min read there are different ways to look at branding and it is certain that i have a very different one it is fascinating to imagine the journey of a brand that starts with an idea from an entrepreneur personality interests and environments bring to life ideas leading to a project and the first version of a brand followed by ongoing cycles of brand innovations brands tend to be perceived as intangible but the whole process of branding is definitely chemical physical and biological even the slightest brand association is supported in our brain by dozens of neuronal links and is constantly shaped and reshaped by our experiences with this physical dimension in mind we can imagine how brands are also moved by forces that are yet to be fully understood and summarized into their own principia it is fascinating to consider how emotions or memories can activate brand messages to explore the role of design and colors in forming brand perceptions to imagine these thresholds that we jump over when forming a preference for a brand or considering a purchase to admire the power of the alchemy that enables loyalty to sustain over time digitalization is changing our interaction modalities and adding a supplementary layer to the system the forces that shape brands’ perceptions today are the result of highly complex underlying systems including everything from neuroscience biology psychology and semiotics up to microeconomics and behavioral sciences understanding how branding works is an infinite field for study and amazement our ambition is to observe the phenomena of branding practice branding and unveil the principles of branding here are a few observations about the growth of branding in china gleaned over the past years related how big brands foster global – yet regional – loyalty and awareness  pragmatic and mercantile stage with low innovation brand awareness and brand esteem are determinant it is a period dominated by a form of classicism in continuity with the previous decade the context is a fast growing china economy with companies looking inland and to lower tiers as a reservoir for growth it is the epitome of fully optimistic worryfree china where the brands function as identifiers without the need of building indepth associations it is a thriving nation gearing towards the olympics it is all about being fast present loud and obvious tapping into the trend of mainstream adoption – even for the luxury brands characterized by the golden age of the monogram the consumers are distracted by novelty very few have built enough experience in dealing with brands in order to sacrifice exploration there is no brand loyalty what matters is the ability to monopolize the space be it retail or advertising it is still a quite traditional branding age with tvc and magazine ads holding a predominant role not yet driven by the digital revolution that is about to come foreign brands tend to be at this time only a name often not translated into chinese and seldom appearing in written form most of the ceos gms and brand and marketing managers even question the need for a local identity the “foreignness” defines a very clear premium and niche space further adaptation in terms of relevance beyond the notion of making a brand available and wellknown and differentiation appears to be premature and unnecessary big winners are the biggest brands that tend to already get recognition most consumers want not only to experience but also to display what they are experiencing they do this with a recognizable badge known by all not just their peers this is a time when chinese consumers are very confident in the future they are unwilling to project themselves into a company’s brand heritage they are satisfied by floating on the surface of branding and do not gain pride in being discerning and driven to individuality we only see a few fmcg brands innovating for china functional biscuits by danone and a slimming tea for women by lipton many chinese brands are in the situation of being partly oem for other markets partly consumer brands they feel no pressure in their consumer brand business that seems to be a nice asset mostly handled through wholesale to the gigantic china market place we see the emergence of strong fmcg brands like wahaha the strengthening of local automotive brands the growth of sport brands like lining that have the ambition to conquer the world these brands usually have very centralized decisionmaking capabilities and immature bureaucratic formations they are fast and they benefit from the local turf advantage but they are neither processoriented nor sustainable some of them have original approaches to innovation working with their value chain partners to develop products and concept ideas like wahaha it is one of the early signs of the chinaspecific consumer goods innovation model the first tier cities are evolving concurrently at a fast pace beijing is moving rapidly ahead propelled by the olympics shanghai is becoming a magnet for international media as they report on reviving the city’s past luster and making the most futuristic megalopolis of the st century guangzhou and shenzhen are raised to international recognition by the strong manufacturing backbone of the pearl delta regions shenzhen is a new city attracting talents from all over china all these cities are the crucible for a new china lifestyle that blends influences from the west american european and the east taiwan japan and korea hollywood is in china via the dvd stores and korean dramas are starting to fascinate china it is the emergence of successful bakery chains and coffee chains bread and coffee are becoming part of the daily life of shanghainese and to people in some parts of beijing and guangzhoushenzhen it is the new signs of bourgeois life that replace or complement the pajama streetwalking and long nails of days gone by we see urbanization the rapid raise of real estate prices across the country avid demand for new construction construction and manufacturing companies experience record growth bb and real estate companies are sophisticating their offerings in what has become the biggest market in the world china starts to uncover needs for brand innovations in the least expected place at that time and still for a few years the most unhappening industry for brand innovation is the luxury industry in china related the csuite david chen ceo of strikingly  brands become more innovative on product level more ambitions for chinese brands start of the strengthening of brands but on new projects and opportunities not at the core this second period is a turning point in the chinese journey china is no longer in the shadow now benefiting from its status as a growing superpower the olympic games in beijing put china on the global stage and leave a lasting impression the event has also created a platform for branding as the attention of an entire nation is centralized and focused during the years surrounding the event we see incredible branding campaigns from nike and adidas carving out their brand territories in the chinese market as has seldom been done before maybe the  apple ad is the only comparable event in the history of branding with the crisis hitting the developed economies china has become the hope of the world to sustain the growth of the global economy chinese travelers the chinese domestic market chinese manufacturing development and china’s need for primary resources are a solace amid dropping demand in most other regions the global crisis is the spark that has ignited the evolution of branding in china now the chinese companies feel that their destiny is no longer just to copy successful models but to take the lead innovate and push the boundaries internet brands are the first to capitalize on this new mindset now oem are barely a reliable way to imagine sustainable growth instead brands are pushing forward in the chinese consumer market at first things seem to be continuing as they were but before long fmcg brands start to meet a kind of invisible wall they are no longer growing almost automatically and stocks are piling up this triggers a stronger need for developing brands that can sustain through relatively depressed times chinese companies start to become savvier in terms of understanding the importance of the brand resulting sometimes in epic fights over trademark rights like the battle over the trademark wanglaoji with decades of opening up in different markets and several years into the wto china is now becoming an increasingly competitive market in almost every industry we also see increasing demand for innovative product concepts that will not only try to bring an existing concept to china but also adapt and transform it to make it more relevant more different this is often happening at the product level more than at the brand level we are looking for innovation of the persona to create localized variants but not yet a revolution of the brand program for china some very emblematic projects for labbrand represent this trend—we work on developing product positioning through flavors for industries including dairy quick service restaurants fruit juice and others we also see a luxury brand shangxia created under hermes group with what appears to be chinese dna reviving chinese traditional crafts into finely designed fabrics homeware and accessories this is a very ambitious move very admirable and ahead of its time as the chinese consumer has yet to revalorize their own craftsmanship tradition quality entertainment and culture makes it also relevant for brands like disney to foster a faster pace of development for their brands marvel is a successful example of this with its multitude of branded heroes the digital space has become more and more innovative and starts to play a much more important role than in most western economies enabling the development of more advanced services and creating higher expectations to summarize this turning point put differentiation and relevance of brands at the center again it is no longer about fame and mainstream it is about making a difference about surprising and delighting the consumer it is now a competitive era but it is just the beginning of this intensification see also  experts answer  key about destination branding  strengthening of brand relevance and differentiation first investments into brand knowledge after the olympics beijing continues to grow but somehow closer to traditional chinese values leaving shanghai almost alone to represent the cosmopolitism that it once tried to contest shanghai further propelled by the world expo in  continues to be the favorite destination for multinationals and becomes the regional hub for many companies shanghai is more permissive to foreign influences and we see a tremendous change in the city in these years shanghai now has  starbucks and counting – the rd most of any city in the world and compared to just  in beijing and this is not just about coffee and bread you can now see literally hundreds of olive oil brands in supermarkets the selection is huge specialized large scale supermarkets like olé are mushrooming in the city with an incredibly wide range of brands for any category of packaged food guangzhou and shenzhen are close behind and chengdu has started to modernize deeply as an influential center for the west shanghai is a fascinating place in which to project the future of china a place of experimentation a place where all global trends are crossing it a place of harmonious coexistence of different trends such as increasing body efficiency through vitamins and improving wellbeing through natureinspired products these intersections are mediated by a growing variety of consumers gaps are becoming bigger and bigger between younger consumers and mid aged ones more profound segmentation is taking place at the same time we witness the first global successes of chinese brands with chinese mobile brands rising to extreme success in india and even worldwide huawei zte etc this is motivating for all chinese brands even if a large majority of them just set out to be successful in their domestic market global public relations digital platforms and social media are now the type of activity that chinese brands are engaging in consistently and on a global scale chinese brands look for brand building help it is part of the china year plan there is no future in pure manufacturing it is in the state’s best interest to develop strong brands that can maintain chinese economic growth added value and a brand mindset are the only way to go as companies strengthen their brands by making them more relevant a change is in the air this time it is not a tactical move but a clear ambition to set a lasting direction at labbrand we see increasing
