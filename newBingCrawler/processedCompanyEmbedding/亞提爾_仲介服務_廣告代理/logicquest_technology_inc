which was  more than the net loss of  for the nine month period ended september   the change in our results over the two periods is a result of an increase in selling general and administrative

financing activities during the nine months ended september   was nil and nil during the nine months ended september   to date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares and on loans from officers and directors related companies and an independent third party in order to sustain our basic minimum operating expenses however we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares or that our officers and directors related companies or the independent third party will provide us with any future loans we intend to use debt to cover the anticipated negative cash flows until we can operate at a breakeven cash flow mode we may seek additional capital to fund potential costs associated with possible expansion andor acquisitions we believe that future funding may be obtained from public or private offerings of equity securities debt or convertible debt securities or other sources stockholders should assume that any additional funding will likely be dilutive we are not aware of any known trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way future financings we anticipate continuing to rely on loans from a related company we may obtain funding through equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders there is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities we presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and these differences may be material we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition our companys internet connectivity business ceased effective june   our company has currently no business stockbased compensation accounting standard  accounting for stockbased compensation asc  established financial accounting and reporting standards for stockbased employee compensation plans it defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument in january  we implemented asc  and accordingly we account for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with asc  we account for share based payments to nonemployees in accordance with asc  accounting for equity instruments issued to nonemployees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow market or foreign currency risks we evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income for optionbased derivative financial instruments we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is reassessed at the end of each reporting period derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether or not netcash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within  months of the balance sheet date going concern we remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated march   included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern during the nine months ended september   and the year ended december   we have been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support our operations and have been dependent on debt raised from a related party during the nine months ended september   and  we experienced negative financial results as follows nine months ended september    net loss       negative working capital     stockholders deficit     these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements contained herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitable operations however there is no assurance that profitable operations or sufficient cash flows will occur in the future nov   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage

and logicquest technology limited or by share purchase whereby we would purchase the shares of logicquest from its shareholders for cash andor for shares of our company the mou provided that we would pay an aggregate of usd to the shareholders of logicquest technology limited for all issued and outstanding share of logicquest technology limited payable as follows a  on closing of the transaction b  six months from closing of the transaction and c  on the first anniversary of the closing of the transaction    the mou further provided that the parties would enter into a definitive agreement to

pursue a business combination with logicquest technology limited  our management intends to seek and evaluate opportunities to create value for our shareholders through merger or acquisition results of operations we had a net loss of  for the year ended december   which was  more than the net loss of  for the year ended december   the change in our results over the two periods is mainly a result of an increase in selling general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related increase for the year ended december   and

financing activities cash provided by financing activities was nil during the year ended december   and  to date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares and on loans from officers and directors related companies and an independent third party in order to sustain our basic minimum operating expenses however we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares or that our officers and directors related companies or the independent third party will provide us with any future loans  we intend to use debt to cover the anticipated negative cash flows until we can operate at a breakeven cash flow mode we may seek additional capital to fund potential costs associated with possible expansion andor acquisitions we believe that future funding may be obtained from public or private offerings of equity securities debt or convertible debt securities or other sources stockholders should assume that any additional funding will likely be dilutive we are not aware of any known trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way forecast the internet connectivity business of our company ceased on june   the management is seeking potential merger or acquisition candidates critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and these differences may be material we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements stockbased compensation accounting standard  accounting for stockbased compensation asc  established financial accounting and reporting standards for stockbased employee compensation plans it defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument in january  we implemented asc  and accordingly we account for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with asc  we account for share based payments to nonemployees in accordance with asc  accounting for equity instruments issued to nonemployees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services the final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for nonperformance    going concern we remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated march   which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern during the years ended december   and  we have been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support our operations and have been dependent on debt raised from related parties and independent third parties we experienced negative financial results as follows               net loss           negative working capital             stockholders deficit             these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements contained herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitable operations however there is no assurance that profitable operations or sufficient cash flows will occur in the future our current operations are primarily funded by logicquest technology limited a company controlled by the companys chief financial officer mr cheng yew siong these steps have provided us with the cash flows to continue our business but have not resulted in significant improvement in our financial position we are considering alternatives to address our cash flow situation that include · raising capital through additional sale of our common stock andor debt securities · reducing cash operating expenses to levels that are in line with current revenues these alternatives could result in substantial dilution of existing stockholders there can be no assurance that our current financial position can be improved that we can raise additional working capital or that we can achieve positive cash flows from operations our longterm viability as a going concern is dependent upon the following · our ability to locate sources of debt or equity funding to meet current commitments and nearterm future requirements · our ability to achieve profitability and ultimately generate

when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties fair value of financial instruments for certain of the companys financial instruments including prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated it is not however practical to determine the fair value of amounts due to  related parties and lease and management arrangement with related parties if any due to their related party nature income taxes the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial amounts at yearend the company provides a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their net realizable value f logicquest technology inc notes to financial
