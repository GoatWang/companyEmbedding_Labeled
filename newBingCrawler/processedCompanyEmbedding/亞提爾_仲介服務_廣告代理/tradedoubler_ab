networkto register now click on this link and fill in the form register here what is affiliate marketing affiliate marketing is a type of performancebased marketing in which a retailer rewards one or more publishers referred to as “affiliates” for each visitor or customer brought by the publisher’s own marketing efforts the publisher is usually rewarded for a predefined action such as a sale a newsletter registration a download or a click essentially publishers act as an outsourced sales team for the advertiser promoting their products and getting rewarded most often on a percentage of the basket value what’s in it for me there are many reasons to use the affiliate model in favour of other monetisation routes rewards the payout to publishers is usually higher than you can get via other metrics a costperacquisition cpa model where the advertiser pays out a percentage of the basket value can deliver significant rewards to publishers and also reward them based on what is sold
