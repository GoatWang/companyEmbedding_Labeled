alert to maximize its addressable market a mostly fixed cost structure means that incremental revenue drops to the bottom line adjusted ebitda is poised to grow rapidly as revenue grows techtarget nasdaqttgt is a name in which i have summarized the basic business in previous articles from a numbers perspective the stock is appealing it trades at x e ebitda with ebitda growing at a  clip in each of  and  there is plenty of headroom in the business model because the companys costs are basically fixed as such the company and we feel that it can get to a  ebitda margin over time versus  in  it deal alert described below is  of the overall business and is growing at a  annual pace we feel this can drive  overall top line growth for the foreseeable future the stock is down significantly recently because their q numbers missed and they lowered guidance for the year this was due to marketing cuts at their big customers who were faced with revenue shortfalls due to the recent currency headwinds even given the lowered guidance ebitda will still grow by  versus  what does techtarget do in a nutshell it is an internet company that has  different websites focused on the enterprise it professional each website focuses on a slightly different aspect of technology and has content written by the companys  editors as well as datasheets and white papers written by it vendors the goal of the sites is to educate it professionals as well as give them a place to do research when they are looking to make an it purchase the companys core business model is to sell leads to its it vendor customers think cisco hp ibm etc ttgt has  million registered users who frequents its sites and when one of its registered users clicks on a datasheet or whitepaper or podcast supplied by an it vendor the company sells that lead to that vendor by analyzing the patterns of user traffic over the years ttgt found that it was able to predict with high accuracy when an enterprise it firm was looking to make an imminent purchase of it equipment it then took this information and actually confirmed if it was true with the enterprise it firm and gathered more data from them such as the size of the purchase the incumbent vendors and who was currently lined up as the top candidates it took all of this information and started selling it on a subscription basis to the it vendors as a product called it deal alert this basic product has gone from no revenue two years ago to  of ttgts business today as time has gone by and techtarget has gathered feedback from its customers it has begun to segment the basic product so as to maximize its potential with each type of buyer at its end customer qualified sales opportunities is the it deal alert product focused on customers direct salesforces which need actionable leads with as much information as possible qualified sales opportunities for the channel is a version of this product directed at it vendor channel partners priority engine is made for inside sales and marketing teams and is integrated with salesforcecom to help customers prioritize their sales leads deal data is for data scientists at large customers and is a direct upload of all of ttgts raw purchase intent data on its last conference call techtarget announced a new product that will be rolling out in the fall this product will use ttgts postdeal data to give very rapid and accurate reads of market share and pricing data and this information will be sold to both it vendors and also the investment community it deal alert overall in all of its forms is still a nascent offering from techtarget and has a lot of room to run this revenue ramp will result in increasing ebitda and eps at the company and this in turn will drive the share price we feel that x ebitda is a fair multiple for the company given its growth rate and as such our price target is   upside on  numbers and   upside on  numbers disclosure the author is long ttgt the author wrote this article
