marketing  promotions inc “the company” or “mobiquity” we operate through two whollyowned us subsidiaries namely mobiquity networks inc and ace marketing  promotions inc mobiquity networks owns  of mobiquity wireless slu a company incorporated in spain this corporation had an office in spain to support our us operations which office was closed in the fourth quarter of    we operate a national locationbased mobile advertising network that has developed a consumerfocused proximity network which we believe is unlike any other in the united states our integrated suite of proprietary location based mobile advertising technologies allows clients to execute more personalized and contextually relevant experiences driving brand awareness and incremental revenue   mobiquity technologies inc a new york corporation otcqb mobq through its whollyowned subsidiary mobiquity networks inc has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising technology company focused on driving awareness and foottraffic throughout its indoor mallbased beacon network into a next generation mobile location data and marketing company the company provides precise unique atscale location based data and insights on consumer’s real world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research with our combined exclusive data sets of shopping malls premium outlets and cinemas beacon data and first party location data via our advanced software development kit sdk utilizing multiple geolocation technologies mobiquity networks provides one of the most accurate and scaled solution for mobile data collection and analysis this should create several additional revenue streams including but not limited to push notification campaigns retargeting campaigns data provision audience profiles attribution reporting and custom research   ace marketing is our legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers while ace marketing currently represents substantially all of our revenue we anticipate that activity from ace marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our mobiquity networks business   going concern  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern the companys continued existence is dependent upon the companys ability to obtain additional debt andor equity financing to advance its new technology revenue stream the company has incurred losses for the three months ended march   as of march   the company has an accumulated deficit of  the company has had negative cash flows from operating activities of  for the three months ended march   these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern   management has plans to address the company’s financial situation as follows   in the near term management plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the company’s business plan related to the bluetoothenabled ibeacon compatible technology management will continue to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the company’s financial obligations there is no assurance however that lenders and investors will continue to advance capital to the company or that the new business operations will be profitable the possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential inability to achieve profitability raises doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   in the long term management believes that the company’s projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the company that will be used to finance the company’s future growth however there can be no assurances that the company’s efforts to raise equity and debt at acceptable terms or that the planned activities will be successful or that the company will ultimately attain profitability the company’s longterm viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt or equity funding to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations and the ability of the company to achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations   principles of consolidation  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mobiquity technologies inc formerly known as ace marketing  promotions inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries mobiquity networks inc ace marketing inc which has had its name changed to ace marketing  promotions inc and mobiquity wireless slu all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation                the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of march   the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended march   and  and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended march   and  have been prepared by us without audit and in accordance with the requirements of form q and therefore they do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in our opinion the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects our financial position as of march   results of operations for the three months ended march   and  and cash flows for the three months ended march   and  all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature the results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year we have evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this form q with the sec and determined there have not been any events that have occurred that would require adjustments to our unaudited condensed financial statements   the information contained in this report on form q should he read in conjunction with our form k for our fiscal year ended december     estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments the company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability as the case may be in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level   the following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value     · level   observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   · level   inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means   · level   unobservable inputs reflecting the companys assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value these assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available   the carrying amounts of the companys financial assets and liabilities such as cash prepaid expenses other current assets accounts payable  accrued expenses certain notes payable and notes payable  related party approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   the company accounts for its derivative liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis under level          level      level      level      total     fair value of derivatives      –            –           embedded conversion features   the company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under asc  derivatives and hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion features should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings if the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under asc  the instrument is evaluated under asc  debt with conversion and other options for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature   derivative financial instruments   the company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting related to four convertible notes issued and outstanding totaling  which included a ratchet provision in the conversion prices which range between  embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the company’s balance sheet the company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change the company has estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a multinomial lattice model as of march   the fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter which resulted in a gain of  and derivative expense of  during the three and months ended march   as of march   the fair market value of the derivatives aggregated  using the following assumptions estimated  to year term estimated volatility of  to  and a discount rate of  to             cash and cash equivalents include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of march   and december   these securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as level  within our fair value hierarchy   the carrying amounts of financial instruments including accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities and promissory note approximated fair value as of march   and december   because of the relatively shortterm maturity of these instruments and their market interest rates no instruments are carried at fair value   cash and cash equivalents  the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less as well as bank money market accounts to be cash equivalents as of march   and december   the balances were  and  respectively   concentration of credit risk  financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents   concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the companys customer base and their dispersion across geographic areas principally within the united states the company routinely addresses the financial strength of its customers and as a consequence believes that its receivable credit risk exposure is limited   the company places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions at times the company maintains bank account balances which exceed fdic limits as of march   and december   the company exceeded fdic limits by  and  respectively   revenue recognition — the company recognizes revenue for all revenue streams when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with asc  revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met     · persuasive evidence for an agreement exists   · service has been provided   · the fee is fixed or determinable and   · collection is reasonably assured   ace marketing — ace marketings revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in general title passes to our customers upon the customers receipt of the merchandise revenue is recognized on a gross basis since ace marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership latitude in selection of vendors and pricing and bears all credit risk advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits ace marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold when incurred additional source of revenue derived from emailstexts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided   mobiquity networks – revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale the customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign which are normally in short duration periods the second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data revenue from data can occur in two ways the first is a direct feed which is billed at the end of each month the second way is through the purchasing of audience segments when an audience segment is purchased we bill the buyer upon delivery which is usually  days for the order date                allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march   and december   allowance for doubtful accounts were  and  respectively   inventory  inventory is recorded at cost first in first out and is comprised of finished goods the company maintains an inventory on hand for its largest customers frequent order items all items held are branded for the customer therefore are not available for public distribution the company has an agreement with this customer for cost recovery if vendor relationship is terminated there have been minimal reserves placed on inventory based on this arrangement as of march   and december   the company has reserved against  and  respectively   property and equipment  property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation is expensed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets leasehold improvements are being amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the remaining term of the lease the costs of additions and improvements which substantially extend the useful life of a particular asset are capitalized repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account and the gain or loss on disposition is reflected in operating income   long lived assets  longlived assets such as property equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset the fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows market value of similar assets if available or independent appraisals if required if the carrying amount of the longlived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset when fair values are not available the company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets the company recognized  impairment losses for the period ended december   and  for the period ended march     website technology  website technology developed during the prior years were capitalized for the period of development and testing expenditures during the planning stage and after implementation have been expensed in accordance with asc    advertising costs  advertising costs are expensed as incurred for the three months ended march   and march   there were advertising costs of  and  respectively   accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the company uses the blacksholes optionpricing model to determine fair value of the awards which involves certain subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term the estimated volatility of the companys common stock price over the expected term volatility and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed forfeitures changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stockbased compensation and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations refer to note  stock option plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for a more detailed discussion   beneficial conversions  debt instruments that contain a beneficial conversion feature are recorded as deemed interest to the holders of the convertible debt instruments the beneficial conversion is calculated as the difference between the fair values of the underlying common stock less the proceeds that have been received for the debt instrument limited to the value received   foreign currency translations  the companys functional and reporting currency is the us dollar we own a subsidiary in europe our subsidiarys functional currency is the euro all transactions initiated in euros are translated into us dollars in accordance with asc  translation of financial statements as follows     i monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date         ii fixed assets and equity transactions at historical rates         iii revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period                  adjustments arising from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss therefore translation adjustments are not included in determining net income loss but reported as other comprehensive income   income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities for which income tax or tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   recently issued accounting pronouncements   we have reviewed the fasb issued accounting standards update asu accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods the company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporations reported financial position or operations in the near term the applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration   note  loss per share   basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period dilutive loss per share gives effect to stock options and warrants which are considered to be dilutive common stock equivalents basic loss per common share was computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding the number of common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise of certain options and warrants that were excluded from the diluted loss per common share calculation was approximately  because they are antidilutive as a

transaction completed by the company prior to each respective conversion date   the company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting related to four convertible notes issued totaling  which included a ratchet provision in the conversion price of  or  or a price equal to the last equity transaction completed by the company as part of a subscription agreement  the notes have maturity dates ranging from may   – september   embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the company’s balance sheet the company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change the company has estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a multinomial lattice model as of march

forwardlooking statements   company overview   mobiquity technologies inc a new york corporation the “company” is the parent company of two operating subsidiaries mobiquity networks inc“mobiquity networks” and ace marketing  promotions inc “ace marketing” the company’s whollyowned subsidiary mobiquity networks has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising technology company focused on driving awareness and foottraffic throughout its indoor mallbased beacon network into a next generation mobile location data and marketing company mobiquity networks provides precise unique atscale locationbased data and insights on consumer’s real world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research with our combined data sets of shopping malls premium outlets and cinemas beacon data and first party location data via our advanced software development kit “sdk” utilizing multiple geolocation technologies mobiquity networks provides one of the most accurate and scaled solution for mobile data collection and analysis mobiquity networks is seeking to create several new revenue streams from the mobile data collection and analysis including but not limited to push notification campaigns mobile audiences  segments realtime data provision attribution reporting and custom research the company is also attempting to reduce expenses by renegotiating certain mall developer agreements   ace marketing is our legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers while ace marketing currently represents substantially all of our revenue we anticipate that activity from ace marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our mobiquity networks business we believe that our mobiquity networks business represents our greatest growth opportunity going forward   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements                revenue recognition  ace marketing’s revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in general title passes to our customers upon shipment of the merchandise revenue is recognized on a gross basis since ace marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership latitude in selection of vendors and pricing and bears all credit risk advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits ace marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold when incurred additional source of revenue derived from emailstexts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided   revenue recognition – mobiquity networks revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale the customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign which are normally in short duration periods the second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data revenue from data can occur in two ways the first is a direct feed which is billed at the end of each month the second way is through the purchasing of audience segments when an audience segment is purchased we bill the buyer upon delivery which is usually  days for the order date    allowance for doubtful accounts  we are required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations as to the realizability of our accounts receivable we make these assessments based on the following factors a historical experience b customer concentrations customer credit worthiness d current economic conditions and e changes in customer payment terms   accounting for stock based compensation  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the company uses the blacksholes optionpricing model to determine fair value of the awards which involves certain subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them “expected term” the estimated volatility of the company’s common stock price over the expected term “volatility” and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed “forfeitures” changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stockbased compensation and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations   plan of operation   mobiquity networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above all of the products used to derive revenue for the company are reliant on the collection of data to achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward we have developed a strategy to increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection one strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on a monthly basis “mau” and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations places available to see our mau’s visit over the same time period we are currently seeing approximately  unique mobile devices by the mau on a monthly basis and roughly  unique devices for the first  days of  the ability to see and collect the data required from these unique devices comes from the installation of our proprietary software development kit sdk into third party mobile applications apps to continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis we need to have our sdk installed in more third party apps we believe our unique offering to potential app partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry the task of partnering with third party apps for installation of our sdk is handled internally by our business development team   as of march   we had approximately  places in our proprietary places database and that number should increase to over  places by the end of the second quarter  thus exponentially increasing the amount of data we collect we have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies the task of growing our places database is handled by our internal technology team the company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings management intends to hire additional sales personnel in the last three quarters of  as working capital permits   results of operations   the

revenues in the same fiscal period of the prior year cost of revenues includes purchases and freight costs associated with the shipping of merchandise to our customers the change in cost of revenues

revenues compared to  in the same fiscal period of the prior year or  of revenues gross profits will vary periodtoperiod depending upon a number of factors including the mix of items sold and the volume of product sold also it is our practice to pass freight costs on to our customers with low to no profit margin as advertising revenue from the use of our mobiquity devices increases it is expected that our margins will increase significantly as our mall network has only recently been constructed and is currently being expanded at the current time revenues from the use of our mobiquity devices are not a material portion of our consolidated revenues   selling general and administrative expenses were  for the first quarter of  compared to  in the comparable period of the prior year a decrease of approximately  such operating costs include payroll and related expenses commissions insurance rents fee payments to simon property group macerich malls and ggp malls professional consulting and public awareness fees   the net operating loss for the first quarter of  was  as compared to  for the comparable period of the prior year the change in operating loss is attributable to reductions in salaries rents commissions and noncash stock based compensation   no benefit for income taxes is provided for in the reported periods due to the full valuation allowance on the net

stock for the quarter ended march     our company commenced operations in  and was initially funded by our three founders each of whom has made demand loans to our company that have been repaid since  we have relied primarily on equity financing from outside investors to supplement our cash flow from operations                  we anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to finance our accounts receivable and inventories hire additional sales persons capital expenditures and possible acquisitions the primary sources of funding for such requirements will be cash generated from operations raising additional capital from the sale of equity or other securities and borrowings under debt facilities which currently do not exist we believe that we can generate sufficient cash flow from these sources to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months in the event we should need additional financing we can provide no assurances that we will be able to
