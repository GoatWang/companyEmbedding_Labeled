ads drove more than  of criteos revenue extac during the quarter shares of criteo sa adr  may have fallen  wednesday after the advertisingretargeting specialist announced firstquarter  results wednesday morning but dont take that to mean the companys performance was subpar lets take a closer look at how criteo kicked off the new year criteo results the raw numbers  metric q  actuals q  actuals growth yoy revenue extac  million  million  net income available to shareholders  million  million  net income per share    extac  excluding trafficacquisition costs yoy  year over year data source criteo sa  what happened with criteo this quarter revenue extac climbed  year over year on a constant currency basis adjusted net income grew  year over year to  million or  per diluted share adjusted ebitda increased   at constant currency to  million  by comparison both the top and bottom lines were above expectations criteos guidance provided last quarter called for lower revenue extac of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda of  million to  million cash flow from operations was  million down from  million this time last year while free cash flow declined to  million from  million both figures were negatively affected by an unusual change in working capital on higher income tax paid criteo cfo benoit fouilland explained during the subsequent conference call that the working capital pattern we saw in q  specifically on the payable side was quite unusual and have since normalized the quarter ended with cash and equivalents of  million up from  million at the end of  criteo added more than  net clients in q and maintained client retention at  existing clients at the end of last years first quarter generated  more revenue extac at constant currency in the latest quarter speaking to criteos ability to expand revenue within its existing customer base more than  of revenue extac was generated from mobile ads during the quarter ceo eric eichman said during the subsequent conference call that virtually all clients are using our complete multiscreen solution nearly  advertisers are live on facebook mobile via criteos integration with dynamic product ads as of

are making advertising accountable to performance metrics through innovation and technology eichmann said  is off to a strong start and our pipeline of exciting new products will continue to fuel high growth we delivered fast growth and increased profitability fouilland succinctly added this combination remains a unique feature of our business model looking forward for the current quarter criteo expects revenue extac between  million to  million with adjusted ebitda between  million and  million with the caveat that we dont lend much credence to wall streets nearterm demands analysts consensus estimates similarly called for secondquarter revenue of  million for the full year  criteo continues to expect revenue extac growth of between  and  at constant currency while adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of revenue should increase between  and  basis points all things considered this was another solid showing from criteo despite broad advertising industry headwinds

shares of criteo sa adr nasdaqcrto may have fallen  wednesday after the advertisingretargeting specialist announced firstquarter  results wednesday morning but dont take that to mean the companys performance was subpar lets take a closer look at how criteo kicked off the new year criteo results the raw numbers  metric q  actuals q  actuals growth yoy revenue extac  million  million  net income available to shareholders  million  million  net income per share    extac  excluding trafficacquisition costs yoy  year over year data source criteo sa  what happened with criteo this quarter revenue extac climbed  year over year on a constant currency basis adjusted net income grew  year over year to  million or  per diluted share adjusted ebitda increased   at constant currency to  million  by comparison both the top and bottom lines were above expectations criteos guidance provided last quarter called for lower revenue extac of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda of  million to  million cash flow from operations was  million down from  million this time last year while free cash flow declined to  million from  million both figures were negatively affected by an unusual change in working capital on higher income tax paid criteo cfo benoit fouilland explained during the subsequent conference call that the working capital pattern we saw in q  specifically on the payable side was quite unusual and have since normalized the quarter ended with cash and equivalents of  million up from  million at the end of  criteo added more than  net clients in q and maintained client retention at  existing clients at the end of last years first quarter generated  more revenue extac at constant currency in the latest quarter speaking to criteos ability to expand revenue within its existing customer base more than  of revenue extac was generated from mobile ads during the quarter ceo eric eichman said during the subsequent conference call that virtually all clients are using our complete multiscreen solution nearly  advertisers are live on facebook mobile via criteos integration with dynamic product ads as of the end of the quarter up from just over  at the end of q  on a

through innovation and technology eichmann said  is off to a strong start and our pipeline of exciting new products will continue to fuel high growth we delivered fast growth and increased profitability fouilland succinctly added this combination remains a unique feature of our business model looking forward for the current quarter criteo expects revenue extac between  million to  million with adjusted ebitda between  million and  million with the caveat that we dont lend much credence to wall streets nearterm demands analysts consensus estimates similarly called for secondquarter revenue of  million for the full year  criteo continues to expect revenue extac growth of between  and  at constant currency while adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of revenue should increase between  and  basis points all things considered this was another solid showing from criteo despite broad advertising industry headwinds especially as it reiterated the strong fullyear
