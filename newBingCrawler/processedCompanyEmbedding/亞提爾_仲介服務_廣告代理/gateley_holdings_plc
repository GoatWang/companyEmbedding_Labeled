liability and insurance attachment in our latest blog we look at whether the availability of insurance covering certain losses affects the validity of exclusion or limitation clauses that seek to exclude or limit liability for those losses it is common for contracts to contain clauses whereby a party tries to exclude or limit its liability when something goes wrong this can range from excluding all liability whatsoever to excluding or limiting liability for certain types of losses for example indirect or consequential losses generally speaking parties are free to include such clauses in their contracts although liability for death or personal injury cannot be excluded however any such clause must satisfy the test of reasonableness contained in the unfair contract terms act  ucta  so what is reasonable ucta  defines reasonableness as what is fair and reasonable having regard to the circumstances known to the parties when the contract was made this is not a particularly helpful definition but luckily ucta  also provides guidelines for deciding what is reasonable these include the following factors the relative bargaining positions of the parties and whether a party knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent of the term it will also be relevant to look at how the parties intended to allocate risk and whether the exclusion or limitation clause skews this reasonableness and insurance not surprisingly the availability of insurance is a specific factor that the courts take in account when deciding whether an exclusion or limitation clause is reasonable for example where a party purports to limit its liability to a specified amount the court will look at whether the party seeking to limit its liability to that amount has insurance to cover the liability or could have had such insurance so where a party has indemnity insurance covering the liability well in excess of the amount it purports to limit its liability to the limitation will probably be found to be unreasonable on the flipside insurance will also be relevant where the other party ie the party against whom the exclusion or limitation clause is being enforced has or could have had insurance to cover its liability so where the other party has insurance covering the type of loss it is likely that the exclusion or limitation clause will be held to be reasonable this is also the case where a party did not have such insurance but could reasonably have obtained it if it had tried by contrast if the potential loss and damage was too wide and variable and could not be reasonably insured against then a clause purporting to exclude or limit liability for that loss and damage is likely to be held unreasonable so is insurance relevant the availability of insurance covering the type of loss or damage that a party seeks to exclude or limit is undoubtedly relevant by way of summary the availability of insurance covering that type of loss may well mean that the exclusion or limitation clause is found to be reasonable and therefore valid conversely if the loss or damage is simply too wide to insure against then the clause seeking to exclude or limit liability for that loss of damage will probably be found to be unreasonable and therefore invalid this blog was written by will cursham for further information please contact will cursham associate
