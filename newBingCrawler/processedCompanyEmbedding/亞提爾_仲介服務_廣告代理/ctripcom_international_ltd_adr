nasdaqctrp showed robust growth across all of its lines in its quarterly earnings report on wednesday and showed impressive leverage the stock was down  at  pm on thursday concerns about slowing growth at chinas leading online travel agency ota make sense given the companys torrid past rates but two things should stand out from the report ctrip continues to grab market share and this is increasingly becoming a winnertakesall field as growing margins show the companys operational leverage image source getty images ctrip earnings the raw numbers while ill dive into the details below here are the headline numbers from the companys release metric q  q  yearoveryear growth revenue  million  million  gross profit  million  million  operating profit  million  million  data source ctripcom operating profit presented on nongaap basis heading into the quarter management had expected revenue to jump between  and  results came in ahead of expectations the recent addition of the skyscanner businesses added meaningfully to results as well more importantly gross profit expanded  basis points to  this means ctrip is spending less on its inventory of air bus train and hotel accommodations three years ago this would have been unthinkable as the industry was caught in a race to the bottom on price since the effective merger with rival qunar though that has all changed ctrip is now the de facto ota in china and that gives the company leverage over airlines and hotels  instead of the other way around operating profit margins  after backing out sharebased compensation  also expanded meaningfully  basis points to  last year was full of costs associated with integrating qunar and ctrip this year those are in place and it showed as nongaap operating expenses jumped just  against the backdrop of a  increase in revenue digging deeper ctrip has four main segments that report as you can see the first two make up the lions share of sales but all four continued to show strong growth segment sales yearoveryear growth transportation  million  accommodations  million  packaged tours  million  corporate travel  million  data source ctripcom  accommodations grew mostly through increased organic volume transportation was juiced both from strong growth in the core of air travel additions from skyscanner and the small but booming base of business emerging out of bus and train tickets in china perhaps some of the reason for the markets tepid reaction has to do with skepticism of the companys ability to grow organically but these same concerns surfaced after the addition of qunar and the increase in profitability more than made up for topline growth concerns what management had to say founder and chairman james liang made it clear that the company will continue to focus not only on travel within china but outside of it as well by leveraging skyscanner and other strategic overseas investments we expect to further strengthen our international product offerings and improve user experiences for both chinese and international travelers  ceo jane jie sun said ctrip has also been making great strides in penetrating into lowertier cities that combined with the aforementioned push for international travels out of china appears to be the companys focus moving forward the good news for investors is that these investments are unlikely to cost as much as those from years past looking ahead after factoring in this quarters results shares of ctrip now trade for  times nongaap trailing earnings for the current quarter management is expecting revenue

abroad chinas largest online travel agency notched growth in all four of its key business segments brian stoffel tmfcheesehead feb   at 9pm ctripcom nasdaqctrp chinas largest online travel agency ota announced earnings for the fourth quarter of  this week and the company saw rapid revenue growth a strategic move toward travel outside of china and  most impressively  expanding margins image source getty images ctripcom results the raw numbers because the companys profitability is significantly skewed due to the consolidation of qunar these are the results that most investors are focused on metric q  q  yearoveryear change revenue  million  million  gross profit  million  million  operating profit  million  million  data source ctripcom  these results came in ahead of management expectations and show just how much leverage the company has now that the ota industry in china has undergone massive consolidation the companys nongaap operating margin increased from  during the fourth quarter of  to  in the most recent quarter the importance of that basispoint expansion cannot be overstated growth in product development and sales and marketing spending actually outpaced revenue growth but this has more to do with assuming all of the obligations associated with qunar than actual increases in spending indeed on a sequential basis spending on these two divisions was actually down  and  respectively from the previous quarter breaking down the numbers further as is the companys tradition all four of the key business segments were given more specific breakdowns division sales yearoveryear growth transportation  million 9 accommodations  million  packaged tours  million  corp travel  million 9 data source ctripcom here again the company did not disappoint the rapid growth of revenue in transportation and accommodations shows that the network effect is truly taking hold as more people flock to ctrip to buy tickets vendors are incentivized to join the network as vendors join chinese citizens have more reasons to use the platform its a virtuous cycle that helps drive results and compound gains for decades  and keeps whatever competition is left at bay that was evident in both train and bus ticketing while the revenue that these two provide pales in comparison to airline travel these segments grew sales by  and  respectively over the past year what else happened during the quarter in late  ctrip announced that it would be acquiring scotlandbased skyscanner a global metasearch engine for travel the transition closed during the fourth quarter founder and chairman james liang said together with skyscanner we expect to further extend our international air ticketing services to local customers in asiapacific and other markets around the world as the chinese middle class continues to grow they will likely be going beyond the middle kingdoms borders skyscanner is the companys attempt to make sure that those customers dont migrate to other global otas when the time comes to make travel plans looking ahead alas the days of  growth cant last forever thats to be expected when you have larger and larger hurdles to jump over moving forward management sees revenue growing by  to  management sees margins improving to somewhere between  and  over the next three years if margins continue to expand at that rate theres still plenty of very
