pin pdip supply requirement  to  v power supply the cmxa is a multistandard modem ic for use in telephone based information and telemetry systems control of the device is via a simple high speed serial bus compatible with most types of µc serial interface the data transmitted and received by the modem is also transferred over the same serial bus onchip programmable tx and rx usarts meeting the requirements of v are provided for use with asynchronous data and allow unformatted synchronous data to be received or transmitted as bit words a highquality dtmf decoder with excellent immunity to falsing on voice and a standard dtmf encoder are included alternatively these blocks can be used to transmit and detect userspecific programmed single and dualtone signals call progress signals or modem calling and answering tones flexible line driver and receive hybrid circuits are integrated on chip requiring only passive external components to build a  or wire line interface the device also features a hook switch relay drive output and a ring detector circuit which continues to function when the device is in the powersave mode providing an interrupt which can be used to wake up the host µcontroller when line voltage reversal or ringing is detected block diagram design support information faqs   application notes   evaluation   knowledge base   package     cmx and cmxa faq   q i see that a cmx and cmxa both exist can you tell me what the difference is and whether i would have problems migrating from my existing cmx design to a cmxa based unit a there are three major changes the dtmf decoder performance has been improved to give greater compatibility with worldwide exchanges and the dtmf encoders supplied by other manufacturers the dynamic range has been increased to improve the compatibility with normal transmission conditions particularly where lines are encountered the acceptable twist has been increased to cope with lowcost daas and lines additionally the algorithm has been extensively modified to provide a high immunity to voice signals secondly the hybrid function has been improved to increase rejection of transmitted signals and harmonics and reduces the number of components in the daa and simplifies the design of dccoupled daas lastly a transmit output tristate capability has been added where the outputs of the cmxa are independently tristateable allowing the line and hence the receiver to be biased without terminating the line callerid signals flowing through a hook switch bypass capacitor will see a high impedance termination which gives a better match to the receiver input this method offers the possibility of improved sn performance over other lowcost approaches a current design that uses the cmx can use the cmxa as it should be considered a drop in replacement the additional features should appear invisible to existing software and hardware designs q i see that the cmxa datasheet  data bulletin has a paragraph that discusses the need for an additional db of transhybrid loss what is this talking about and why do i need it a the transhybrid loss refers to attenuation of the tx output signal that gets fed back into the rx input path of the same device if the db transhybrid loss is not provided then the sensitivity in originate mode will be reduced from the minimum must detect value of db this reduction in sensitivity is due to hz carrier rejection in the receiver path being around db while the addition of db of transhybrid loss will result in optimum performance neglecting the additional db of transhybrid loss will not prevent operation and may be acceptable in some applications q i have been trying to program the cmxa programming register but it does not seem to work what is the suggested method of writing to this register a writing to the programming register is performed via the cml cbus one register address is required for each data word you must also ensure that the programming flag bit in the status register is set before writing to the programming register the process is as follows address for programming register e sent on command data line first word for the programming register is loaded onto command data line check the programming bit flag in the status register  b   if true then continue address for programming register e sent on command data line second word for the programming register is loaded onto command data line check the programming bit flag in the status register  b   if true then continue address for programming register e sent on command data line third word for the programming register is loaded onto command data line continue    note if the latency between writes is long typically greater than us it is not required to check the status register bit flag please refer to the data sheet q is it possible to use at commands to control the cmxa vbis modem a the cmxa interfaces directly to a host controller via a simple serial control bus which permits low level control if an at command set is desired then an interpreter will be resident in the host controller to control the cmxa within its demo kit the de a simple at command parser is provided in the embedded software the full c source code for the controller software is available from the cml website see evaluation tab q how do i detect cas on the cmx cmx or cmx q can i do type  cid caller identity on the cmx cmx or cmx a the programmable tone pair can detect the cas tone required for type  cid but an unacceptable tendency to false is likely this is because both filters are likely to ring due to the narrow bandwidth required the cmxb provides a very efficient cas detector that can be interfaced through the cmx cmx and cmx the method described does not require any additional connections to the host microprocessor and very few additional components view informative diagram the cmxb input signal is derived from the same signal input as the cmxx the gain components around the cmxb may need to be adjusted see the cmxb data sheet for more information the cmxb mode input is clamped to vss so that its mode is selected by the state of the zp input when the cmxx is powersaved or onhook the cmxb will be powersaved when the cmxx goes offhook the cmxb will come out of powersave and go into cas detect mode the cas should be detected around ms after it starts and det will go low this will cause the cmxx to detect a ring signal the ring detect flag will go low and the cmxx will generate an interrupt provided this interrupt is unmasked this method allows the cas detector to be polled and the interrupt to be masked polling is necessary to measure the length of the cas to qualify it the software must remember to differentiate between a genuine ring detect and a cas detect cas detection method the cmxx will be offhook approximately ms after the start of the cas the cmxx will signal a ring detect ring detect will go high status register e b   and if unmasked general control register e b   an interrupt will be signalled the interrupt should be masked and ring detect polled to confirm that the cas is present for the expected period following the cas detect a short period of silence occurs during which the near end handset is muted any line activity can be confirmed by polling the energy detect flag status register e b this is important to help reduce the incidence of false cas detection the ring detect interrupt should be masked for the remainder of the cid transaction please note the cml disclaimer notice for applications and faq
