emphasis relating to the basis of preparation which is reproduced below this emphasis drew attention to the companys requirement to manage the timing of settlement of its liabilities and raise funds in the immediate to short term and the profitability of key projects thereafter to satisfy liabilities associated with its activities it noted that a material uncertainty remains which may cast significant doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concernthe basis of preparation is reproduced belowgoing concernthe groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the chairmans statement and below the financial position of the group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements in addition note  to the financial statements includes the groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and exposures to credit risk and liquidity riskthe net liability balance sheet position as at  september  being the groups financial yearend was £  £  subsequent to the balance sheet date the board has been able to agree funding in the form of further share issues raising £ in cash and exchanged £ worth of shares for services receivedthe company continues to be reliant upon its continuing ability to manage the timing of settlement both of its current liabilities and future liabilities as they arise future fundraising will be required in the immediate to short term thereafter however developing revenue lines through its various projects including its subsidiary nexstar and the expansion of the passion project are expected to ease the reliance on fundraising in the coming monthsthe companys focus is on the generation of revenues across each of its business units the group is already at the contract stage with a number of new customers and as a result the board has prepared forecasts to reflect these new revenues which show the business becoming selfsustaining in the near future should any of these factors not deliver the funding envisaged by the directors then alternative sources of funds would continue to be requiredthe directors have concluded that the need to generate future funds from further fundraising and from trading activities to satisfy the settlement of its ongoing and future liabilities represents a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt upon the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern nevertheless after making enquiries and considering this uncertainty and the measures that can be taken to mitigate the uncertainty the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company will have adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future for these reasons they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts the financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the group and company was unable to continue as a going concern loss per sharethe calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year the calculation of diluted

registrar of companies and those of  will be delivered in due course the consolidated statement of comprehensive income consolidated statement of financial position consolidated cash flow consolidated statement of changes in equity above and associated notes are extracts from the financial statements and do not constitute the groups statutory accounts statutory accounts for the year to  september  and  september  have been reported on by the independent auditors the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu eu adopted ifrss the independent auditors report on the annual report and financial statements for  and for  was unqualified but did draw attention to matters by way of emphasis relating to the basis of preparation which is reproduced below this emphasis drew attention to the companys requirement to manage the timing of settlement of its liabilities and raise funds in the immediate to short term and the profitability of key projects thereafter to satisfy liabilities associated with its activities it noted that a material uncertainty remains which may cast significant doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the basis of preparation is reproduced below going concern the groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the chairmans statement and below the financial position of the group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements in addition note  to the financial statements includes the groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk the net liability balance sheet position as at  september  being the groups financial yearend was £  £  subsequent to the balance sheet date the board has been able to agree funding in the form of further share issues raising £ in cash and exchanged £ worth of shares for services received the company continues to be reliant upon its continuing ability to manage the timing of settlement both of its current liabilities and future liabilities as they arise future fundraising will be required in the immediate to short term thereafter however developing revenue lines through its various projects including its subsidiary nexstar and the expansion of the passion project are expected to ease the reliance on fundraising in the coming months the companys focus is on the generation of revenues across each of its business units the group is already at the contract stage with a number of new customers and as a result the board has prepared forecasts to reflect these new revenues which show the business becoming selfsustaining in the near future should any of these factors not deliver the funding envisaged by the directors then alternative sources of funds would continue to be required the directors have concluded that the need to generate future funds from further fundraising and from trading activities to satisfy the settlement of its ongoing and future liabilities represents a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt upon the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern nevertheless after making enquiries and considering this uncertainty and the measures that can be taken to mitigate the uncertainty the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company will have adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future for these reasons they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts the financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the group and company was unable to continue as a going concern  loss per share the calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year the calculation of diluted loss per share is based on the basic loss per share adjusted to allow for the issue of shares and the post tax effect of dividends and interest on the assumed conversion of all other dilutive options and other potential ordinary shares            there were  share options outstanding at the yearend   however the figures for  and  have not been adjusted to reflect conversion of these share
