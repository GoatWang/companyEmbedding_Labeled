lawsuit against television audience measurement tam a joint venture of the former competitors nielsen and kantar media research which for years has provided the only tv audience measurement system in india wpp plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of kantar and imrb ndtvs lawsuit filed in the new york state supreme court under the foreign corrupt practices act and seeking  billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty cited a public conversation between vikram chandra ceo of ndtv and martin sorrell ceo of wpp in which chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful wpp responded that the lawsuit had not been served on wpp or any of its operating companies the new york court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal seeking legal costs and that it was considering a lawsuit against ndtv for defamation a threat which ndtv in turn called baseless the motion to dismiss was filed a week later with the statement in its memorandum of law that this case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action referencesedit  a b c preliminary results  pdf wpp plc retrieved  april

the world leader in communications services it comprises leading companies in all these disciplines advertising media investment management data investment management public relations  public affairs branding  identity healthcare communications direct digital promotion  relationship marketing specialist communications there are more than  companies within the group – and each is a distinctive brand in its own right each has its own identity commands its own loyalty and is committed to its own specialist expertise that is their individual strength clients seek their talent and their experience on a brandbybrand basis between them our companies work with  of the fortune global  all  of the dow jones  and  of the nasdaq  it is also of increasing value to clients that wpp companies and their people can work together as increasingly they do providing a tailormade range of integrated communications services nearly  clients are now served in three distinct disciplines over  clients

and a need for a wide range of marketing services wpp can act as a portal to provide a single point of contact and accountability read why we exist what we think in praise of the long view by sir martin sorrell champions of the long view are becoming harder to find boardrooms in the west at least are more likely to be inhabited by the ghosts of lehman than john maynard keynes’ animal spirits consequently targets are often reached not by maximising revenues but by minimising costs – including marketing spend despite the challenges our business performed well in  which was another record year for the group we expect the pattern for  to be much the same a bit of a slog but a satisfactory result at the end of it ahead of last year looking further into the future corporate minds will eventually turn to investment and growth and marketing services will be one of the principal beneficiaries throughout our three decades of existence taking the long view has worked well for wpp and its stakeholders we have the right strategy to take advantage of the fundamental shifts – both technological and geographical – shaping our industry we continue to focus on new markets new media data
