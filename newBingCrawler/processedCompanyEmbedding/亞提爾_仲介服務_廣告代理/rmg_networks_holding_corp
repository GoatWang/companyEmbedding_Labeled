amortization of the companys customer order backlog from the date of acquisition in accordance with us gaap  advertising revenue which comprised  of total revenues for the period april  through december   generates a lower gross margin than the average gross margin for the companys other products and services as previously noted there was no advertising revenue in the year ended january    the company also had a lower gross margin on product sales in the period ended december   because of sales mix operating expenses operating expenses totaled  and  for the period april  through

bank accounts of its subsidiaries located outside the united states the company currently plans to use this cash to fund its ongoing foreign operations if the company were to repatriate the cash held by its subsidiary located outside the united states it may incur tax liabilities management feels that the company has an adequate amount of cash to operate the company for at least twelve months from december   despite our present liquidity position however if we fail to achieve the level of revenues that we forecast including as a result of an extended downturn or lower than expected demand for our products and services we could generate less cash flow than we have budgeted under those circumstances our cash on hand and funds from operations may not be sufficient to fund our operations or pursue strategic transactions and we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing there is no assurance however that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all at december   the company had outstanding debt of  this debt represents the remaining balance of the borrowings the company made in connection with the acquisition of symon as discussed above and the additional funds borrowed when the company refinanced its debt on november   the company has generated and used cash as follows successor predecessor company company april   through december  year
