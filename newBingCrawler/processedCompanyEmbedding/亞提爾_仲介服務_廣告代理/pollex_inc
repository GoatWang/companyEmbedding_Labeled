receiver spur was invented to remove a specific firearm characteristic that can classify the firearm as an assault weapon while there are several characteristics that can classify a firearm as an assault weapon the receiver spur focuses on one key characteristic as detailed below click here to view the nysafe features presentation to see any images or descriptions to aid in diagnosing your firearm what is the spur the spur is a nylon  injection molded component that can be used to replace a protruding pistol grip on an ar rifle this durable piece will not absorb solvents or oils commonly found around firearms increasing the durability of the spur this component is custom molded by s  b products inc a company built with the sportsman in mind s  b has leveraged the knowledge of a law enforcement officer with over  years of experience to create a product that will allow sportsmen with a specific firearm to try to conform to the guidelines set forth by the safe act we deal in small  large volumes the best way to get a price is email us and let us know the quantity you seek spur pricing email us dealer pricing available for dealers only call  understanding the safe act the nysafe act has impacted the landscape of firearm ownership this act in particular has greatly impacted the owners of ar rifles in nys and more specifically those looking to own an ar in the state of new york below are the criteria by which a firearm falls under the safe act if the sole criteria governing your firearm is the one below the stars then the receiver spur is a viable solution does the firearm have a folding or telescoping stock does the firearm have a protruding pistol grip does the firearm have a thumbhole stock does the firearm have a second handgrip or a protruding pistol grip that can be utilized by the nonshooting hand does the firearm have a bayonet mount does the firearm have a flash surpressor does the firearm have a muzzle break does the firearm have a grenade launcher does the firearm have a threaded barrel to accommodate flash surpression or muzzle breaks youve got questions weve got answers below are some of the most commonly asked questions associated with the receiver spur and where it stands with respect to the nys safe act does the receiver spur need to be permanently attached to an ar rifle no the receiver spur is a permanently modified part that cannot be turned into a pistol grip the nysafe act states that modifications to remove certain features is permissible will the spur fit the ar yes the spur does fit the ar and functions properly however aesthetically there is a small gap at the back of the spur where it meets the gun will it help with the safe act we have not received anything in writing from nys we are currently pressing the state for an official written determination we are confident the ar receiver spur does not run afoul of the law our attorney assures us we have not misrepresented our product or what it accomplishes the ny safe act permits modifications to remove design characteristics that define a rifle as an assault weapon has nys ruled on the spur yet short answer is no nothing in writing from nys yet every lawful authority state and local we have conferred with has assured us the ar receiver spur does not run afoul of the law we are going to continue to press the state for a written determination i spent  years in law enforcement and i am confident this modification relieves the rifle from the assault weapon definition if the pistol grip is the sole characteristic have questions fire away

tackle it by elizabeth wasserman elizabeth wasserman is editor of incs technology website inctechnologycom based in the washington dc area she has more than  years experience writing about business technology and politics for newspapers magazines and websites her work has appeared in such publications as congressional quarterly business week portfolio and slate  comments credit getty images one of the secrets to business success is pricing your products properly price your products correctly and that can enhance how much you sell creating the foundation for a business that will prosper get your pricing strategy wrong and you may create problems that your business may never be able to overcomeits probably the toughest thing there is to do says charles toftoy associate professor of management science at george washington university its part art and part sciencethere are a variety of different types of pricing strategies in business however theres no one surefire formulabased approach that suits all types of products businesses or markets pricing your product usually involves considering certain key factors including pinpointing your target customer tracking how much competitors are charging and understanding the relationship between quality and price the good news is you have a great deal of flexibility in how you set your prices thats also the bad newsthe following pages will detail how to meet your business goals in pricing products what factors to consider when pricing and how to determine whether or raise or lower your prices dig deeper how to profit from market researchhow to price your products meeting business goalsget clear about making moneythe first step is to get real clear about what you want to achieve with your pricing strategy you want to make money thats why you own a business making money means generating enough revenue from selling your products so that you can not only cover your costs but take a profit and perhaps expand your businessthe biggest mistake many businesses make is to believe that price alone drives sales your ability to sell is what drives sales and that means hiring the right sales people and adopting the right sales strategy the first thing you have to understand is the selling price is a function of your ability to sell and nothing else says lawrence l steinmetz coauthor of how to sell at margins higher than your competitors  winning every sale at full price rate or fee wiley  and a business consultant in boulder colo for  years whats the difference between an  rolex and a  seiko watch the seiko is a better time piece its far more accurate¦ the difference is your ability to sellat the same time be aware of the risks that accompany making poor pricing decisions there are two main pitfalls you can encounter  under pricing and over pricing   under pricing pricing your products for too low a cost can have a disastrous impact on your bottom line even though business owners often believe this is what they ought to do in a down economy accurately pricing your product is critical at any point in the economic cycle but no more so than in a recession says laura willett a small business consultant and faculty member in the finance department at bentley college in waltham mass many businesses mistakenly under price their products attempting to convince the consumer that their product is the least expensive alternative hoping to drive up volume but more often than not it is simply perceived as cheap remember that consumers want to feel that they are getting their moneys worth and most are unwilling to purchase from a seller they believe to have less value willett says businesses also need to be very careful that they are fully covering their costs when pricing products reducing prices to the point where you are giving away the product will not be in the firms best interest long term willett says over pricing on the flip side overpricing a product can be just as detrimental since the buyer is always going to be looking at your competitors pricing willett says  pricing beyond the customers desire to pay can also decrease sales toftoy says one pitfall is that business people will be tempted to price too high right out of the gate they think that they have to cover all the expenses of people who work for them the lease etc and this is what price it takes to do all that he says put yourself in the customers shoes what would be a fair price to you he advises taking little surveys of customers with two or three questions on an indexcardsized form asking them whether the pricing was fair understand your other business prioritiesthere are other reasons to go into business understand what you want out of your business when pricing your products aside from maximizing profits it may be important for you to maximize market share with your product  that may help you decrease your costs or it may result in what economists call network effects ie the value of your product increases as more people use it a great example of a product having network effect is microsofts windows operating system when more people began to use windows over rival products more software developers made applications to run on that platformyou may also want your product to be known for its quality rather than just being the cheapest on the market if so you may want to price your product higher to reflect the quality during a downturn you may have other business priorities such as sheer survival so you may want to price your products to recoup enough to keep your company in business dig deeper how to price business services how to price your products factors to consider there are many methods available to determine the right price willett says but successful firms use a combination of tools and know that the key factor to consider is always your customer first the more you know about your customer the better youll be able to provide what they value and the more youll be able to chargeknow your customerundertaking some sort of market research is essential to getting to know your customer willett says this type of research can range from informal surveys of your existing customer base that you send out in email along with promotions to the more extensive and potentially expensive research projects undertaken by third party consulting firms market research firms can explore your market and segment your potential customers very granularly  by demographics by what they buy by whether they are price sensitive etc if you dont have a few thousand dollars to spend on market research you might just look at consumers in terms of a few distinct groups  the budget sensitive the convenience centered and those for whom status makes a difference then figure out which segment youre targeting and price accordinglyknow your costsa fundamental tenet of pricing is that you need to cover your costs and then factor in a profit that means you have to know how much your product costs you also have to understand how much you need to mark up the product and how many you need to sell to turn a profit remember that the cost of a product is more than the literal cost of the item it also includes overhead costs overhead costs may include fixed costs like rent and variable costs like shipping or stocking fees you must include these costs in your estimate of the real cost of your product come up with x first x is your cost of raw materials labor rent and everything it took to make the product so that if you sold it you would break even advises toftoy y becomes what you think you need to make on it that may depend on your business restaurants overall make about  percent which is pretty low if you want  percent then you factor that into your costs and that is what you chargemany businesses either dont factor in all their costs and under price or literally factor in all their costs and expect to make a profit with one product and therefore overcharge a good rule of thumb is to make a spread sheet of all the costs you need to cover every month which might include the following your actual product costs including labor and the costs of marketing and selling those products all of the operating expenses necessary to own and operate the business the costs associated with borrowing money debt service costs your salary as the owner andor manager of the business a return on the capital you and any other owners or shareholders have invested capital for future expansion and replacement of fixed assets as they age list the dollar amount for each on your spreadsheet the total should give you a good idea of the gross revenues you will need to generate to ensure you cover all those costsknow your revenue target you should also have a revenue target for how much of a profit you want your business to make take that revenue target factor in your costs for producing marketing and selling your product and you can come up with a price per product that you want to charge if you only have one product this is a simple process estimate the number of units of that product you expect to sell over the next year then divide your revenue target by the number of units you expect to sell and you have the price at which you need to sell your product in order to achieve your revenue and profit goalsif you have a number of different products you need to allocate your overall revenue target by each product then do the same calculation to arrive at the price at which you need to sell each product in order to achieve your financial goalsknow your competition its also helpful to look at the competition  after all your customer most likely will too are the products offered comparable to yours  if so you can use their pricing as an initial gauge willett suggests then look to see whether there is additional value in your product do you for example offer additional service with your product or is your good of perceived higher quality  if so you may be able to support a higher price  be cautious about regional differences and always consider your costsit may even be worthwhile to prepare a headtohead comparison of the price of your products to your competitors products the key here is to compare net prices not just the list or published price this information could come from phone calls secret shopping published data etc make notes during this process about how your company and products  and the competition  are perceived by the market be brutally honest in your evaluationknow where the market is headedclearly you cant be a soothsayer but you can keep track of outside factors that will impact the demand for your product in the future these factors can range from something as simple as longterm weather patterns to laws that may impact future sales of your products also take into account your competitors and their actions will a competitor respond to your introduction of a new product on the market by engaging your business in a price war dig deeper when customers grumble about price hikes how to price your products deciding to raise or lower prices one size does not fit all you can only go so far pricing all your products based on a fixed markup from cost  your product price should vary depending on a number of factors including what the market is willing to pay how your company and product are perceived in the market what your competitors charge whether the product is highly visible and frequently shopped and compared the estimated volume of product you can sell that opens the door to raising andor lowering prices for your products in order to make this call one way or the other you should first understand whats already working analyze the profitability of your existing products so you can do more of what works and stop doing what doesnt work you want to find out which of your existing products are making money and which are losing money you may be surprised at how many of your products are losing money  fix those asapyou should also constantly reevaluate your costs to sell it right you have to buy it right if you are having a hard time selling a product at an acceptable profit the problem may be that you are not buying the product right it may be that your cost is too high rather than your price is too lowwhen to raise prices  and howyou should always be testing new prices new offers and new combinations of benefits and premiums to help you sell more of your product at a better price test new offers each month raise the price and
