ims part   history of international monetary systems part  see handout no four general points as we begin to discuss the history of international monetary systems in this and the next two lectures four general features are worth emphasizing at the outset  the international monetary system how exchange rates balance of payments and macroeconomic management are managed and adjusted globally is part of a broader international regime as such it is influenced strongly by the way power is distributed and exercised in the world as well as the presence or absence of a powerful and reliable leader country over time international monetary systems exhibit oscillation between two opposites for example i general floating versus general fixity ii stability versus instability and iii free capital mobility versus no such mobility it is hard to say which situation is normal and which is abnormal people often believe that the prevailing system is normal and permanent but it usually isnt whether capital mobility has become irreversible in the st century is an interesting and open question  the triangle of impossibility consider i exchange rate stability ie fixed exchange rates ii monetary policy independence and iii free capital mobility these three things are regarded as desirable but only two can be realized at any time different international monetary systems emerge depending on which one we give up for example if we abandon the first we have a floating rate system and if the second is removed monetary union like eu will emerge and so on since the th century there has been a gradual movement away from commodity money typically gold toward paper money managed currency the problem with gold is its quantity is too constraining which is also a merit if the central bank is irresponsible in the st century maybe we will have emoney which has completely new characteristics and risks historical overview from the th century to present the major international monetary systems have evolved as follows gold standard until  fixed rates under uk dominance throughout most of the th century and up to  outbreak of ww the world was on a gold standard especially the period of  was called the classical gold standard or international gold standard because all major countries participated in it trade was liberalized and capital was mobileinterwar period after ww the world powers tried to return to the gold standard at prewar parities ie at the previous exchange rates but the attempt to restore gold convertibility did not succeed except momentarily the ss were characterized by recessions banking crises the great depression and the rise of fascism exchange rates were mostly floating and protectionism increased there was a hegemonic power shift from the uk to the us bretton woods system s uscentered fixed rates under the international dollar standard the world economy experienced high growth price stability and movement toward freer trade unlike the gold standard days however there were severe restrictions on private capital mobilitygeneral floating and attempts to reduce instabilities  after the transition period of  the major currencies started to float soon it was discovered that currency sometimes fluctuated too much crises and calm periods alternated overshooting currency crises and massive capital flows became common from  major countries occasionally intervened jointly to correct currency levels at the same time european countries strived to create a unified currency in steps which was achieved in  since the late th century to present broad developments in prices and longterm interest rates were as follows inflation was most stable during the bretton woods period with wpi inflation in major countries staying almost at zero for a few decades particularly early s to mid s the th century gold standard also experienced relative price stability although long and mediumterm price swings which were synchronous across all countries existed in the s inflation accelerated with different rates of price increase across countries but since the late s and up to present high inflation subsided except in a small number of developing and transition countries the world faces a relative price stability again even a deflationary trend in some countries including japan longterm interest rates on government and corporate bonds were very stable during the gold standard period but they became unstable and internationally divergent after the s especially the inflationary period of the ss at present interest rates remain different across countries even though the world is financially integrated the classical gold standard  the th century was the century of british economic and military dominance the uk adopted the gold standard in  after the inflation associated with the napoleonic wars stabilized but the other countries remained on bimetallism both gold and silver were used with a fluctuating conversion ratio between them during the s most european countries joined the gold standard in  the us returned to the gold standard when price stability was restored after the civil war in this way from  until the sudden outbreak of ww in july  all major countries in europe and north america were on the gold standard this meant that their economies were closely linked and operating under the same financial mechanism orchestrated by the city london financial market the classical gold standard was truly internationalthis was also a period of imperialism and colonialism by the western powers at the same time the latecomers us germany and japan were rapidly catching up with the uk as a developing country japan joined the gold standard somewhat later in  for details see lecture  of economic development of japan salient features of the classical gold standard were as follows  goods market integration under free trade international price linkage was strong and the world experienced common price movements and business cycles the law of one price the same products bear the same price in different locations held in many commodities and this fact can also be confirmed by econometric studies however one problem was the absence of the nominal anchor see below this means that no country organization or mechanism played the role of stabilizing the global price level as a result there was globally common price fluctuations in the medium and long run financial integration under free capital mobility the private sector could issue sell or buy foreign stocks and bonds freely us railroad bonds were particularly popular as a means to convert british saving into american investment free capital movement resulted in strong interest rate linkage shortterm interest rates were volatile while longterm interest rates were extremely stable and these interest movements were internationally synchronized british interest rates always provided the floor ie they were lowest for the rates of other countries because british securities had highest liquidity and lowest risk premium and because london was the financial center of the world another interesting point was that current account imbalances were huge relative to estimated gdp this means that some countries lent while others borrowed according to their savinginvestment balances and this was not a disequilibrium furthermore banking crises tended to occur simultaneously across countries  fixed exchange rates for  years there was no realignment of major exchange rates in those days the exchange rate was called the gold parity which was the conversion ratio between the home currency and an ounce  grams of gold the cross rates between two currencies could be calculated as the ratio of two gold parities macroeconomic fundamentals were not stable although integrated in trade and finance the world economy was far from stable from the viewpoint of macroeconomy there were booms and busts and severe recessions were experienced financial crises and bank runs were common the nominal anchor a nominal anchor is a mechanism to stabilize nominal variables especially the general price level more plainly it is a mechanism to prevent inflation or deflation this can be an informal policy rule adopted by the central bank such as the taylors rule us shortterm interest rate policy responds to domestic inflation and unemployment it can be a legally binding commitment such as inflation targeting it may depend on the wisdom of the central banker for example like mr alan greenspan alternatively it can be an automatic mechanism the nominal anchor can be domestic or global here we are discussing the nominal anchor for the entire world the point is that no one ensured the price stability of the gold standard worldneither the uk government the bank of england the city nor the supply and demand of gold sherlock holmes dr watson and capital mobility sherlock holmes was a famous london detective in the novels written by sir arthur conan doyle  dr john watson was his friend and assistant in the adventure stories of sherlock holmes we can find many references to foreign securities and investment for example the adventure entitled the dancing men  begins as follows holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product his head was sunk upon his breast and he looked from my point of view like a strange lank bird with dull gray plumage and a black topknot so watson said he suddenly you do not propose to invest in south african securities i gave a start of astonishment accustomed as i was to holmess curious faculties this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable how on earth do you know that i asked apart from econometric studies i think this can be presented as a strong evidence that dr watson and other ordinary citizens often invested in foreign securities although there was no internet in the late th century the transatlantic cable guaranteed that the financial markets in london and new york were integrated on a realtime basis the rules of the game there are two important terms associated with the gold standard the first is the rules of the game and the second is the pricespecies flow mechanism the rules of the game means a set of rules of conduct often implicit but nonetheless binding that are expected of the participating members of a certain system in the case of the classical gold standard the participating countries were required to observe the following rules gold parity each country must declare a fixed value ratio between gold and domestic currency for example  ounce of gold    us dollars  ounce of gold   british pounds and so on this establishes the cross ratio of  british pound   us dollarsconvertibility to gold domestic convertibility all paper money must be exchanged freely to gold at the declared gold parity if the bearer brings it to the central bank usually this promise was clearly printed on bank notes in those days convertibility meant convertibility to gold today it means convertibility to international currencies such as dollar euro and yen free international gold movement international convertibility there should be no restriction on the exportation or importation of gold as a commodity as well as a payment method this guaranteed free monetary mobility based on demand and supply conditions the requirement that the government should not prevent the loss exportation of gold was particularly importantinterest rate policy if a country began to lose gold through a balanceofpayments deficit it was expected to raise shortterm interest rates to attract back the monetary metal conversely if it is gaining gold shortterm interest rates must be lowered to repel the gold inflow by this symmetrical operation it was thought that the monetary authority could assist international adjustment but whether that really worked is an open question as discussed below prof ronald mckinnon stanford university spelled out the rules of the game for other international monetary systems including the bretton woods system general floating until  general floating after  ems etc if interested see the book in the reference section the pricespecies flow mechanism here price means inflation or deflation species true money means gold so this funny term really means a mechanism linking inflationdeflation with gold flows through this mechanism it was thought that the gold standard had a wonderful builtin adjustment mechanism even if governments did nothing international macroeconomic adjustment would occur automatically or so it was argued it works like this if a country has a current account deficit for any reason there will be an outflow of gold the loss of gold means less money supply so this country will have a price deflation after some time its products become cheaper in the global market so exports will rise and imports will fall this improves the current accountit works just the opposite for a country with an initial current account surplus it will accumulate gold which increases money supply and raises the price level the country loses price competitiveness so the trade balance worsens in either case there is a change in the price level that automatically offsets the initial current account imbalance there is no need for central bank action or international policy coordination in fact the us did not even have a central bank until  although this mechanism is still taught today as a key feature of the gold standard whether it really functioned like this is highly questionable evidence strongly suggests otherwise the biggest problem with this explanation is its total neglect of capital mobility it is focused on the current account and price competitiveness only but in a financially integrated world with firmly fixed exchange rates a tiny difference in interest rates will prompt a huge and immediate private capital flow moreover the current account is just a mirror image of the capital account with the opposite sign therefore as long as the country continues to lend or borrow there is no need for the current account to balance in fact throughout the th century the uk always had a current account surplus except for a few years which rose to as high as  of gnp just before ww the us a young developing country with vast investment opportunities continuously had a currentaccount deficit and a strong capital inflow until around  germany was constantly in surplus while sweden was constantly in deficit except for a few years all this reflected each countrys longterm savinginvestment balance moreover since private capital moved swiftly to offset any balance of payments shocks there was no need to ship gold across the atlantic ocean though some gold shipment actually occurred the overall balance of payments current account  capital account could be kept near zero instantaneously as long as capital was mobile the interwar period the ss the classical gold standard was shattered by the outbreak of ww the system collapsed not because of an internal dilemma but because of an external violence as soon as the fighting began in europe private trade and financial transactions were suspended gold exports were banned as international linkage disappeared each country started to issue bonds and print money to finance the war effort they began to have different inflation rates when ww ended the major countries wished to restore the prewar gold standard which seemed to offer prosperity and stability return to gold became the national and even global slogan and it was believed that returning to gold at the prewar parities ie at the previous exchange rates was the right thing to do a report was published and a few important international conferences were held for this purpose uks cunliffe report  conferences in brussels  in genoa  the us returned to gold early in  the uk returned in  most other european states also returned by  so it looked like the gold standard was resurrected but this system lacked leadership and coordination and turned out to be fragile and shortlived as france demanded only gold for international settlements a speculative downward pressure on the uk pound emerged in  the uk abandoned the gold standard again and the other countries followed in the midst of the great depression  countries began to form trade blocs and protected their internal markets global trade continued to shrink militarism and fascism rose japan returned to the gold standard in january  and abandoned it in december  for more details see lecture  of economic development of japan why did the attempt to restore the gold standard in the interwar period fail first the s and s saw frequent recessions and banking crises exception the us economy was booming until  it was thought that governments had first and foremost the responsibility to solve the domestic problems of bankruptcy and unemployment rather than keeping international commitments inwardlooking attitude became dominantsecond there was a leadership vacuum in the international regime the uk the old leader was losing power and incapable of handling the situation the us the new leader would not assume the responsibility yet during the transition period no one watches over big issues third as a result of this and in the absence of policy cooperation each country became selfish protectionism and competitive devaluation escalated under such circumstances the restoration of the prewar international monetary system was impossible during this period the famous british economist john maynard keynes argued against returning to gold this was in  before he wrote the famous general theory in  his argument was roughly as follows at the prewar parity the pound would be  overvalued against the dollar because of the inflation gap between the uk and the us since  if the uk returned to gold at the old exchange rate the tradable sector especially the coal industry would have to suffer severelymoreover from a historical perspective the gold standard was a barbaric relic ie crude and outdated system and should be abandoned the value of money should not be subjected to the demand and supply of gold which was uncontrollable the world should move to paper currency managed scientifically and responsibly by central banks references bordo michael d and anna j schwartz eds a retrospective on the classical gold

units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework determining gross domestic product

all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gva at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gva at factor cost gives the gva at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare isew by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp personal consumption  public nondefensive expenditures  private defensive expenditures  capital formation  services from domestic labour  costs of environmental degradation  depreciation of natural capital in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens introduced a proposal to complementing gdp with environmental and social indicators in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jeanpaul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress cmepsp formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to wellbeing economics with wellbeing framework consisting of health environment work physical safety economic safety political freedom in  the karma ura of the center for bhutan studies published bhutan local gnh index contributors to

oecd better life index was published by the oecd the dimensions of the index included health economic workplace income jobs housing civic engagement life satisfaction in  professors john helliwell

other publications discontinued papers series home research  publications annual report th annual report  the international monetary and financial system  june  abstract the suitable design of international monetary and financial arrangements for the global economy is a longstanding issue a key shortcoming of the existing system is that it tends to heighten the risk of financial imbalances leading to booms and busts in credit and asset prices with serious macroeconomic consequences these imbalances often occur simultaneously across countries deriving strength from international spillovers of various types the global use of the dollar and the euro allows monetary conditions to affect borrowers well beyond the respective issuing economies many countries also import monetary conditions when setting policy rates to limit interest rate differentials and exchange rate movements against the major currencies the global integration of financial markets tends to reinforce these dynamics by allowing common factors to drive capital flows and a common price of risk to move bond and equity prices policies to keep ones own house in order by managing financial cycles would help to reduce such spillovers in addition central banks need to better internalise spillovers not least to avoid the effects of their actions spilling back into their own economies moving beyond enlightened selfinterest would require international cooperation on rules constraining domestic policies full text the suitable design of international monetary and financial arrangements for the global economy is a longstanding issue in economics putting in place mechanisms that facilitate the achievement of sustained noninflationary and balanced growth has proved elusive in the wake of the great financial crisis the issue has again gained prominence on the international policy agenda just as in the past however there is little agreement on what the key shortcomings of the current international monetary and financial system imfs are let alone on what to do about them a common diagnosis has been that the system is unable to prevent the buildup of unsustainable current account imbalances and that this in turn has induced a contractionary bias surplus countries have no incentive to adjust while deficit countries are forced to do so indeed current account imbalances have been a focus of g cooperative efforts this chapter provides a different perspective by arguing that the main shortcoming of existing arrangements is that they tend to compound the weaknesses of domestic monetary and financial frameworks regimes in particular the imfs tends to heighten the risk of financial imbalances  that is unsustainable credit and asset price booms that overstretch balance sheets and can lead to financial crises and serious macroeconomic damage these imbalances occur simultaneously across countries deriving strength from global monetary ease and crossborder financing put differently the system exhibits excess financial elasticity think of an elastic band that can be stretched out further but that as a result eventually snaps back all the more violently the chapter is structured as follows after outlining the key features of the imfs the first section explains and documents how the interaction of domestic monetary and financial regimes increases financial imbalances it highlights several factors i the role of monetary areas that for the key international currencies notably the us dollar extend well beyond national borders ii the limited insulation properties of exchange rates which induce policy responses designed to avoid large interest rate differentials visàvis the main international currencies and iii the powerful waves generated by freely mobile financial capital and global liquidity which wash across currencies and borders carrying financial conditions across the globe the second section considers possible solutions it highlights the need to adjust domestic policy frameworks and to strengthen international cooperation going beyond the ownhouseinorder doctrine the imfs main elements and weaknesses main elements the imfs comprises the arrangements governing transactions in goods services and financial instruments among countries today it consists of a set of domestically oriented policies in a world of largely free capital flows domestic monetary regimes focus mainly on price stability while currencies are allowed to float to varying degrees free floating among the principal international currencies coexists with greater or lesser management of other currencies financial regimes generally allow funds to move freely across currencies and borders although some countries still impose restrictions the main restraint on financial transactions takes the form of prudential regulation and supervision in part based on internationally agreed standards current arrangements differ markedly from the previous system bretton woods  at the time the us dollars convertibility into gold served as an external monetary anchor and currencies were tied together through fixed but adjustable exchange rates table v domestic monetary regimes in general gave less priority to price stability and more to external balance and demand growth while the anchor ultimately did not prove that strong the arrangements contrast with present ones in which the aggregation of monetary policies pursued under domestic mandates acts as the only overall constraint during the bretton woods era the leading international currency was the dollar which now shares this role to some extent with others mainly the euro and international capital mobility was quite limited reflecting a myriad of restrictions on repressed domestic financial systems the performance of the two systems has differed markedly as well bretton woods did not see major episodes of financial instability but eventually proved unable to ensure lasting global monetary stability it broke down once the united states formally abandoned gold convertibility and exchange rates were allowed to float current arrangements have succeeded in promoting price stability more than financial stability arguably this is no coincidence the th annual report as further elaborated in other chapters of this annual report explored why domestic monetary and financial regimes have so far been unable to ensure lasting financial stability but their interaction through the imfs has also played a role by compounding rather than limiting the weaknesses of domestic regimes consider in turn the interaction of monetary and financial arrangements interaction of domestic monetary regimes the interaction of monetary regimes spreads easy monetary conditions from core economies to the rest of the world the international use of reserve currencies does so directly and the strategic conduct of monetary policy does so indirectly take each in turn the reliance on a single global currency has diminished slowly since bretton woods but the us dollar continues to play a dominant role in international trade and finance alongside the euro as a means of exchange the dollar is on one side of no less than  of foreign exchange market transactions table v with an even higher share of forward and swap transactions its dominance in foreign exchange markets makes the dollar the sole intervention currency outside europe and japan which supports its high share in foreign exchange reserves more than half of world trade is invoiced and settled in dollars pointing to the greenbacks preeminent role as a unit of account remarkably the advent of the euro and the dollars trend depreciation since the s have not materially challenged the dollars role as a store of value graph v lefthand panel at  it maintains almost three times the share of the euro in foreign exchange reserves its share in both official reserves and private portfolios is sustained by the scale of what can be termed the dollar zone of economies whose currencies move more closely with the dollar than with the euro box va at half or more of world gdp the dollar zone is far larger than the us economy which is less than a quarter monetary policy settings for key international currencies influence financial conditions outside these currencies home jurisdictions directly through their impact on interest rates and the valuation of assets or liabilities denominated in these currencies but held or owed by nonresidents in particular dollar and euro credit to nonbank borrowers outside the united states and euro area stood at  trillion and € trillion  trillion respectively at end the dollar debt represents a seventh of global gdp outside the united states box vb the large stocks of dollar and eurodenominated credit extended to borrowers outside the united states and the euro area respectively mean that federal reserve and ecb policies are transmitted directly to other economies the impact depends on the characteristics of the instrument in question notably its maturity and the flexibility of the corresponding interest rate for instance in the case of bank loans priced off of dollar libor or euribor changes in shortterm policy rates pass through within weeks over half of dollar and euro credit to borrowers outside the united states and euro area remains in the form of bank loans the passthrough is slower for bonds given their generally fixed rates and longer maturity but then quantities can respond too in particular some stocks of dollar bonds have changed quite markedly in response to unconventional monetary policy chapter iv low yields reflecting the federal reserves largescale purchases of treasury and agency bonds among other factors led us and global investors to seek yield in lowerquality bonds the impact was especially pronounced for nonus borrowers who between  and  ramped up their dollar bond issuance by  trillion graph v lefthand panel investor demand for such bonds proved highly responsive to the compression of the term premium as measured by the spread between treasury bond yields and expected bill yields the lower the premium the faster the growth of dollar bonds issued by nonus borrowers hence the negative relationship after the first quarter of  seen in the righthand panel of graph v by the same token the recent ecb largescale bond purchases and compression of term premia on eurodenominated bonds raise the question of whether borrowers outside the euro area will take advantage of the funding opportunity in fact by the end of  the stock of euro bonds issued by such borrowers was already growing as fast as its dollar counterpart postcrisis offshore dollar credit has grown fastest in those jurisdictions where it has been cheapest relative to local funding especially emerging market economies emes authorities around the world use capital controls or macroprudential policy to raise the cost of dollar borrowing at home but their policy reach does not extend to activities of multinational firms which can borrow dollars or euros offshore to sidestep tight domestic funding conditions this is one reason for the rapid growth in various quantitative measures of global liquidity which denotes the ease of financing in global financial markets box vb box va mapping the dollar and euro zones this box uses simple regression methods to place currencies in three zones of influence corresponding to the main international currencies based on the currencies degree of comovement the three reference currencies are the dollar the euro before  the deutsche mark and the yen consistent with their status as the three most transacted currencies in the world in the bis triennial central bank survey thus defined the dollar zone accounts for nearly  of world gdp far more than the us share in world gdp which is between  and  the dollar share is calculated in two steps first each currency is placed in or between zones each currencys weekly percentage change against the dollar is regressed on the weekly percentage change of the eurodollar and yendollar rates the dollar zone weight is calculated as  minus the corresponding regression coefficients for example the hong kong dollar is pegged to the us dollar so the coefficients are zero and the dollar zone weight is  for the intermediate case of sterling in  the pounds estimated coefficient is  on the eurodollar rate and  on the yendollar making the currencys dollar weight      or  the results in graph va show the dollar to be more global the euro to be more regional and the yen to lack much external influence the dollar weights can thus be read in reverse as euro weights eg with the dark blue area representing over  euro weight second the dollar share is calculated across currencies using ppp gdp weights the dollar zone weight for each of the  economies  before the euro is multiplied by the respective gdp and the product is added to the us gdp this sum is then expressed as a share of the total gdp of the  major economies analysed including those of the united states the euro area and japan graph v plots these aggregate zone shares of global gdp there is strong crosssectional evidence that a currencys comovement with the dollar shapes the currency composition of its external portfolio both official and private for the two dozen economies that disclose the currency composition of official reserves the dollar zone weight accounts for about two thirds of the variation in the dollar share across countries and in larger samples the dollar zone weight is also strongly linked with the dollar share of crossborder bank deposits or loans and international bonds the underlying motivation is the same for the official and private sectors matching the portfolio weights to the comovements of the domestic currency with major currencies serves to minimise the volatility of portfolio returns when measured in domestic currency see r mccauley and t chan currency movements drive reserve composition bis quarterly review december  pp  monetary regimes also interact indirectly through central bank responses to each others policies central banks seem to set their policy rates with an eye on those of the federal reserve or ecb this behaviour is sometimes explicitly noted as in the cases of the central bank of norway and the swiss national bank with reference to ecb policy but appears to be widespread one reason is to limit exchange rate movements exchange rate flexibility has often been described as insulating the domestic economy from external developments but this insulation is often overstated in particular appreciation can lead lenders to consider firms with debts denominated in foreign currency as better capitalised and therefore more creditworthy reducing perceived risks associated with lending and increasing the availability of credit through this and other mechanisms such as carry trades and momentum trading currencies can overshoot shrinking the traded goods sector and leaving the economy vulnerable to a turn in the ease of global financing then depreciation can lead to financial distress among firms with foreign currency debt during the dollars downswing from  to  with an interruption in late  many central banks resisted unwelcome appreciation against the dollar in setting their own policy rates and by intervening in the currency market indeed many countries  not only emes but also advanced economies  appear to have kept interest rates below those that traditional domestic benchmarks would indicate partly in response to low rates in core currencies in the s policy rates were broadly in line with the taylor rule a simple interest rate rule prescribing a mechanical reaction to the output gap and the deviation of inflation from target in the early s however actual policy rates drifted persistently below the levels implied by the taylor rule suggesting that monetary policy became systematically accommodative graph v many advanced economies apparently hesitated to raise interest rates during the boom and have maintained them near zero since the crisis for their part eme authorities appear to have set policy rates low out of concern over capital flows and appreciation graph v righthand panel the empirical significance of us interest rates in influencing policy rates elsewhere provides additional evidence for followtheleader behaviour box vc while this simple exercise has important limitations it points to competitive easing as a way of sustaining external demand more than  central banks have eased monetary policy since december  some explicitly responding to external conditions chapter iv box vb global liquidity as global credit aggregates over the past several years the bis has developed indicators to track global liquidity conditions the term global liquidity is used to mean the ease of financing in global financial markets total credit outstanding is one of its main footprints as it shows the extent to which bond markets and banks have led to the buildup of exposures in covering us dollar and euro credit this box focuses on the two largest components of global credit through which the monetary policies of the respective currency areas directly influence financial conditions in the rest of the world global credit can be extended through bank loans or bonds and each has a domestic and an international component graph vb shows dollar and eurodenominated debt broken down by the location of the borrower some  of global nonfinancial dollar debt at end was incurred by us residents top lefthand panel their liabilities include us public debt us household debt and us corporate debt but  trillion  of dollar credit was extended to nonbank borrowers located outside the united states and these entities are as exposed to the us monetary policy stance as us residents are at  of nonus gdp the stock of offshore dollar credit exceeds its euro counterpart worth  trillion bottom lefthand panel compared with borrowing in us dollars a larger share of overall borrowing in euros takes place from inside the same currency area  the international credit component tends to be more procyclical and volatile international bank lending in both dollars and euros outpaced domestic credit in the boom that preceded the great financial crisis and contracted once the crisis broke out graph vb righthand panels bond markets partly substituted for impaired bank lending in the immediate aftermath of the crisis and increased demand for funding went hand in hand with higher yield spreads since  the search for yield has enabled a surge in issuance at compressed spreads that has helped to push the share of bonds in international credit to  in this second phase of global liquidity bond markets and the asset management industry have taken centre stage in shaping global liquidity conditions see bis highlights of global financing flows bis quarterly review march  pp  and wwwbisorgstatisticsglihtm resistance to appreciation has also taken the form of currency intervention which itself feeds back into global monetary ease many central banks have intervened directly in the foreign exchange market typically buying dollars and then investing the proceeds in bonds issued by the major governments unlike major central banks largescale domestic bond purchases reserve managers have not sought to lower yields in the bond markets in which they invest nevertheless the secular reserve accumulation and balance sheet policies of major central banks have combined to push estimated official bond holdings to more than  trillion out of the  trillion in us euro area japanese and uk government bonds graph ii lefthand panel such holdings account for over half of the outstanding stock of us treasury securities and more than  of the combined stock of treasury and agency securities graph ii righthand panel as a result monetary policies of advanced and emerging market economies have reinforced each other easy monetary conditions at the centre have led to easy monetary and financial conditions in the rest of the world there firms and governments have boosted dollar and euro borrowing and authorities have resisted unwelcome currency appreciation in turn their foreign exchange intervention has raised official investment in major bond markets further compressing bond yields there with central banks and reserve managers bidding for duration shoulder to shoulder with pension funds and life insurers bond yields have declined to record lows and the term premium has turned negative chapter ii interaction of financial regimes financial market integration has allowed common global factors to drive capital flows and asset prices the common factors have partly shifted between the two phases of global liquidity pre and postcrisis box vc international monetary spillovers over recent years interest rates in emes and advanced economies moved closely together with interest rates in large advanced economies particularly the united states this close correlation could reflect the response to common macroeconomic developments affecting all countries but it could also reflect global interest rate spillovers from large advanced economies interest rate spillovers can result from explicit exchange rate policies or attempts to contain exchange rate and capital flow pressures resulting from yield differentials visàvis key currencies and from global investor arbitrage tying capital market rates together to shed light on this question a panel of  emerging market and advanced economies over the period  is investigated in a regression analysis the analysis shows a strong relationship between changes in interest rates prevailing in these economies and changes in us interest rates even after controlling for domestic macroeconomic conditions and the global business and financial cycle for shortterm interest rates a  basis point change in us rates is associated with an average  basis point change in emerging market and small advanced economies table vc first column for longterm interest rates the effect is stronger a  basis point change in the us bond yield is associated with an average  basis point change in the yields of these economies second column besides us interest rates the degree of global investor risk aversion as measured by the vix also consistently emerges as an important driver of these interest rates furthermore the persistently low global policy rates relative to taylor ruleimplied levels since the early s graph v reflect at least in part the effect of low policy rates prevailing in the united states over this period specifically a  basis point cut in the us federal funds rate is found to lower eme and other advanced economy policy rates by  basis points relative to the levels implied by a standard normative taylor rule table vc third column when estimating a descriptive taylor rule the estimated impact of the us policy rate is even higher some  basis points fourth column in sum the results suggest an economically significant causal relationship from us interest rates to interest rates in emerging market and other advanced economies see b hofmann and e takáts international monetary spillovers bis quarterly review forthcoming the bank flows that dominated in the first precrisis phase of global liquidity drew on easy leverage predictable policy rates and low volatility as proxied by the vix these flows enabled domestic credit booms freeing them from the constraint of the domestic funding base in a sample of  emes between early  and  a rise in the share of crossborder bank funding extended both directly to domestic nonbanks and indirectly through banks helped boost the ratio of bank credit to gdp graph v lefthand panel banks found noncore liabilities abroad to fund booming credit at home analysis of a broader sample of  countries and a more inclusive measure of international capital flows points to a similar dynamic here the larger the net debt inflows including both portfolio and bank flows the larger the increase in an economys ratio of bank credit to gdp graph v righthand panel the inclusion of ireland spain and the united kingdom shows that a domestic credit booms reliance on external financing is not a symptom of financial underdevelopment in fact in the subsample of  advanced economies the reliance on capital inflows is greater than among emes as the steeper fitted line suggests in the second postcrisis phase of global liquidity the term premium on sovereign bonds has become a more important driver of funding conditions although crossborder bank credit has continued to expand strongly in emes it has contracted sharply among advanced economies while bond financing has surged across the board even as bond flows have gained prominence the term premium has emerged as the salient global price of risk in integrated financial markets studies of the spillovers across global bond markets around official largescale bond purchase announcements have highlighted the strong comovement of bond yields if investors treat bonds denominated in different currencies as close substitutes purchases in one market also depress yields elsewhere table v illustrates this point summarising several studies that estimate the basis point moves in various advanced bond markets that correspond to a  basis point move in the us treasury market in addition local currency eme bonds have also comoved much more closely with treasuries than a decade ago heretofore the relationship across even major bond markets appeared asymmetric with us bond yields driving those elsewhere but in the past year this seems to have changed in particular there are signs that the euro area bond market has been moving its us counterpart anticipation of ecb largescale bond purchases put downward pressure on french and german bond yields and through comovement of term premia on us bond yields as well despite the expected divergence in policy rates graph v righthand panel this contrasts with the experience in early  which epitomises previous patterns at the time the federal reserve was raising the policy rate while the bank of france and the deutsche bundesbank were reducing theirs but the backup in us bond yields was transmitted to europe graph v lefthand panel current concerns to summarise the workings of the imfs postcrisis have spread easy monetary and financial conditions from the reserve currency areas to the rest of the world just as they did precrisis global financial conditions have consequently loosened to an extent that may not prove consistent with lasting financial and macroeconomic stability credit booms in emes and some advanced economies less affected by the crisis have built up telltale financial imbalances in the short run the imfs has tilted conditions towards expansion but in the longer run financial busts were they to materialise would tilt them towards contraction monetary policy divergence across key currencies and renewed dollar appreciation pose risks ease in the euro area might prolong global ease if firms and governments around the world can substitute euro funding for dollar funding however the large stock of dollar debt outstanding means that a tightening of dollar credit is likely to prove consequential thus renewed dollar strength could expose vulnerabilities chapter iii especially in those firms that have collectively borrowed trillions of dollars admittedly it is well known that the us economy has a short position in the dollar that funds a long position in other currencies and by the same token the rest of the world must hold more dollar assets than dollar liabilities and thus enjoy valuation gains in aggregate when the dollar appreciates but even in a country with a long dollar position the distribution of currency positions across sectors matters greatly for the outcome for example in many emes the official sector has a long dollar position whereas the corporate sector carries a short one box vd absent transfers from the gaining official sector to the losing corporate sector the economy may well be hurt by dollar strength dollar strength monetary policy divergence and heavy official holdings in the global bond market could lead to volatility were emes to draw down reserves substantially their selling bonds in the key currencies could create unprecedented crosscurrents in global bond markets ecb and bank of japan bond purchases eme selling and eventually the federal reserves not rolling over maturing bonds could confront the remaining private investors with a difficult and shifting problem of bond pricing limits and prospects in international policy coordination policies to address the issues raised in this chapter require more than each country managing its inflation and business cycle a broader notion of keeping ones house in order suggests policymakers deploy monetary prudential and fiscal policies to manage financial cycles to ensure lasting monetary financial and macroeconomic stability chapters i and iv the resulting reduction in the frequency and depth of credit booms and busts would greatly reduce negative crosscountry spillovers box vd valuation effects of dollar appreciation this box uses the example of korea to illustrate that dollar appreciation can deliver wealth gains to nonus residents as a whole while still representing a tightening of financial conditions for nonus firms that have funded themselves in the dollar the korean official sector can gain from dollar appreciation but need not adjust its spending while the korean corporate sector can lose net worth and face tighter credit it is by now well known that dollar appreciation boosts us net international liabilities this is because us residents have dollardenominated liabilities to the rest of the world that exceed their corresponding assets to the tune of  of gdp with the appreciation of the dollar in  the us net international investment position declined from  trillion to  trillion as us assets stopped growing in dollar terms despite rising local currency valuations this  trillion difference was more than three times the current account of  billion accordingly the rest of the worlds wealth increased typical of the rest of the world koreas net international investment position as a whole gained from dollar appreciation still korean firms that have borrowed dollars can still see their net worth fall overall the countrys modestly positive  billion in table vd external position shows net foreign currency assets of  billion with over half held by the official sector official reserve assets of  billion and substantial holdings by institutional investors portfolio assets of  billion a substantial fraction of portfolio and other foreign currency liabilities  billion and  billion of foreign currency loans booked by banks in korea are owed by the corporate sector moreover bis data show an additional  billion of mostly dollar bonds issued by offshore affiliates of korean nonfinancial firms and there is also offshore bank credit dollar appreciation leads to official gains that are not conveyed to firms that lose net worth much analysis of international balance sheets in general and the insurance afforded by foreign exchange reserve holdings in particular implicitly suffers from a fallacy of division according to which what is true of the whole is true of the parts in the absence of transfers made when the domestic currency depreciates  which would themselves be fraught with moral hazard  the gains in the public sector do not offset corporate losses firms need to adjust their spending and hiring and if the authorities eventually deploy international reserves to provide dollar liquidity to banks and firms the intervention may follow disruptions that have already exacted a price see c tille the impact of exchange rate movements on us foreign debt federal reserve bank of new york current issues in economics and finance vol  no  january  in addition policymakers could give more weight to international interactions including shared exposures spillovers and feedbacks with a view to keeping the global village in order policies could either seek to prevent crises through measures to restrain the buildup of financial imbalances or to strengthen crisis management including through safety nets an ounce of crisis prevention is worth a pound of crisis management there are clear welfare benefits from reducing the incidence and severity of crises and clear limits of foresight and moral hazard in designing effective safety nets international policy coordination can occur at various depths enlightened selfinterest takes international spillovers into account to the extent that they spill back on ones own economy however even if countries did their best individually this would still fall short of the mark if there were significant international spillovers as in todays era of global liquidity moving towards a more efficient outcome would require greater cooperation including ad hoc joint action and possibly even agreement on rules of the game that constrain domestic policies obstacles present themselves in terms of both analysis and cooperation there is the difficulty of agreeing on a diagnosis of what ails the imfs and even if a common understanding of international spillovers and their causes emerged it would remain challenging to forge and to maintain a common approach among multiple actors of varying sizes subject to differing domestic constraints such possibilities and obstacles are evident in the discussion concerning crisis management during the great financial crisis central banks proved able to make swift joint adjustments to their policy stances and to coordinate closely in extending foreign exchange swaps to each other funding extended under dollar swaps reached almost  billion and under euro swaps € billion the dollar swap lines supported financial stability by allowing the funding of foreign banks with limited access to federal reserve facilities in turn they also restored the monetary transmission mechanism after banks had been bidding up dollar libor relative to the federal funds rate today proposals to modify and extend safety nets face obstacles one reason is deep analytical disagreement is reserve accumulation a byproduct of exchange rate management or a form of selfinsurance against domestic and external crises should international liquidity facilities including currency swap lines between central banks be broadened and what is their best design would enhanced safety nets lead to smaller foreign exchange reserves and even if agreement were reached many aspects of international risksharing would remain problematic despite the room for improvement the status quo may well persist all this reinforces the case for crisis prevention here central banks could seek to internalise the effects of their own policies an improved exchange of information would help authorities to reach a better understanding of international spillovers and spillbacks for instance if the major central banks monetary policies have indeed induced competitive easing among emes the resulting financial imbalances may ultimately hurt the advanced economies what is more such spillbacks may be stronger than in the past in line with emes growing weight in the world economy chapter iii similarly the outsize official role in major bond markets points to the need for policymakers to pay attention to global effects however while global reserve managers might collectively benefit from taking into account the effect of their investment behaviour on global bond yields their individual incentive is to ignore international spillovers box ve consolidating the us external balance sheet much of international macroeconomics assumes that national borders delimit currency zones and decisionmaking units just as the national accounts do it assumes that those borders define the relevant economic territory different currencies do not compete within a given country and firms operate exclusively within national borders in reality neither is the case not only does the domain of major currencies extend outside their country of issue boxes va and vb but multinational firms be they financial or nonfinancial operate across borders management focuses on groupwide profits and risks and balance sheets span national boundaries a consolidated perspective better reflects the reach of multinational firms and the extent of global integration this box uses the us example to illustrate how such a consolidated view of foreign assets and liabilities differs from the official international investment position iip recorded on a residence basis  the defining criterion of the national accounts and balance of payment statistics these are denoted locational in the first two columns of table ve the process of consolidation aligns balance sheets with the nationality of ownership rather than with the location where the assets and liabilities are booked this amounts to redrawing the us border to include the foreign balance sheets of usowned firms and to exclude the us balance sheets of foreign firms this consolidation is performed here for the banking sector and the nonbank business sector multinational companies the first step replaces the banks external positions with consolidated bis data three rows under bankreported in table ve this removes all crossborder claims of say bnp paribas new york on the rest of the world these being french assets and adds jpmorgans consolidated foreign claims yielding a total of  trillion for reporting us banks combined similarly on the liabilities side out goes any crossborder liability of bnp paribas new york and in comes jpmorgans global foreign liabilities to give an estimated  trillion for us banks moreover foreign banks local operations in the united states which are not part of the us external position further add to us consolidated assets and liabilities respectively to the extent that us residents provide funding  trillion to or receive credit  trillion from the us offices of foreign banks consolidating banks raises the sum of us foreign assets and liabilities from  trillion iip to  trillion the second step consolidates foreignowned multinational companies excluding banks in an analogous though coarser way owing to data limitations the crossborder direct investment positions of nonbanks assets and liabilities are replaced by the larger total assets of us multinationals outside the united states and by those of foreign multinationals in the united states respectively rows under direct investment in table ve out goes general electrics equity position in its french subsidiary and in comes that subsidiarys total assets resulting in  billion for all usowned multinationals combined these assets exceed the corresponding ownership claims consisting of  billion worth of equity and equitylike interaffiliate debt in the iip because us multinationals also borrow abroad these liabilities an estimated  billion in turn add to us foreign liabilities as for foreign multinationals french firm totals stake in its us subsidiary is removed and its us assets are added  yielding  billion for foreign multinationals foreign multinationals liabilities  billion count as a us foreign asset this step sextuples directly held corporate assets and liabilities but leaves us net assets unchanged together consolidating banks and multinational companies more than doubles the gross foreign position of the united states us external assets and liabilities combined jump from  trillion on a residence basis iip to an estimated  trillion when measured on a consolidated basis the example reveals that the us economy is more open and its foreign balance sheet larger than is apparent from the external position derived from the balance of payments the calculation of the us current account on the other hand should not be affected by consolidation since foreign earnings are included in net investment income whether they are repatriated or not it may be difficult to go beyond enlightened selfinterest and to revisit rules of the game more broadly many reject a global perspective in the realm of monetary policy accordingly domestic mandates ask major reserveissuing central banks to set policy for a smaller economic domain than that occupied by their currencies this interpretation of domestic mandates contrasts sharply with successful international cooperation in the realm of financial regulation and supervision there national mandates have not precluded extensive international cooperation and the development of global rules a better understanding of the shortcomings of the current imfs would already be a big step forward a widely held view is that the main problem is the imfss apparent inability to prevent large current account imbalances this view of imbalances is the prevailing one in international forums and implies specific adjustment policies such as those associated with the g mutual assessment process the focus on current accounts and the corresponding net resource flows however arguably glosses over the imfss fundamental weakness the aim of rebalancing global demand reduces the notion of imbalances to net flows in goods and services between countries and neglects the greater risk of financial imbalances building up within and across countries to be sure large current account deficits often point to underlying problems but financial booms and busts can and do develop in surplus countries as well an aggregate surplus position may well conceal such vulnerabilities financial imbalances are more closely linked to domestic and international gross positions and need not leave a mark on crossborder net flows  what current accounts represent indeed financial imbalances may not show up in a countrys balance of payments at all if multinationals issue debt offshore for their use abroad for instance this in turn raises the question of the appropriate unit of analysis in international finance with consequences for how one should measure the risks box ve

youve gotta be kidding this is retaliation  employment  labor insider employment  labor insider legalese is not spoken here home our firm our services contact home  retaliation  you’ve gotta be kidding this is retaliation you’ve gotta be kidding this is retaliation by robin shea on january   posted in retaliation guess what you know those sec disclosures about pending litigation that publicly held companies are required by law to make well if an employer says too much it may be “retaliating” against the litigants “what you talkin’ ’bout” i am not making this up international monetary systems ltd is facing a jury trial on a retaliation claim made by a former employee the company is going to trial because it listed the plaintiff by name on the disclosures that it was required to file by the securities and exchange commission the ims disclosures named the plaintiff then a charging party and said that her eeoc charge was “meritless” and that the company “would vigorously defend” plaintiff celia greengrass now a real estate agent in albuquerque worked as an account executive for ims in  and made an internal complaint about alleged harassment by a manager not long after this she quit and she filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission alleging sex and national origin discrimination and retaliation in march  about two months after ms greengrass filed her eeoc charge the company was due to make its annual sec filings which require disclosure of “any material legal proceedings including the principal parties facts giving rise to the proceeding and the relief sought” emphasis is mine the chief financial officer consulted with an outside firm about whether to disclose ms greengrass’s charge details of the consultation are not included in the court’s opinion but the company did not disclose the charge at all presumably because it was not thought at that time to be “material” the company’s quarterly sec disclosures filed for periods ending march  and june   disclosed pending matters but did not identify any parties then in july  the eeoc made a followup request for information related to ms greengrass’s complaint and the company’s general counsel sent an email to several executives expressing concern about the eeoc’s request and how it might require the company to disclose information about other harassment complaints it’s not clear from any of the court decisions why this email was produced despite the fact that it should have been attorneyclient privileged but anyway the company made another sec disclosure for the period ending september   – after the eeoc’s followup request and after the general counsel’s email – and again did not disclose ms greengrass’s identity in january  the eeoc asked to conduct interviews in connection with ms greengrass’s charge the next sec filing was due april   this time the company identified everyone who had a pending charge or lawsuit with respect to ms greengrass the disclosure stated as follows “on january   celia greengrass filed a sexual harassment complaint with the eeoc the claim is still under investigation by the eeoc but ims believes the claims to be meritless and will vigorously defend itself” another similar disclosure was made in may  after the may  filing ims stopped identifying litigants by name in september  the eeoc found reasonable cause in connection with ms greengrass’s charge and the charge was settled in conciliation the company’s annual sec filing for  said that the charge had been settled but did not identify ms greengrass or anyone else by name ms greengrass was unable to get another job so she filed another eeoc charge against ims this time alleging that ims retaliated against her by naming her in the  sec filings she alleged that the sec filing came up whenever she googled her name note to readers – i tried it and i got the same result – see screen shot below and alleged that a recruiter told her that she was unemployable because of the sec filing the eeoc found cause and after getting a righttosue letter ms greengrass filed suit in federal court in wisconsin the court granted summary judgment to ims but ms greengrass took it up to the seventh circuit where a threejudge panel reversed this week and said she was entitled to a jury trial the seventh circuit hears appeals from federal courts in illinois indiana and wisconsin click to enlarge my google search of celia greengrass the sec filings came up but so did the court decisions in her lawsuit streisand effect so unless ims gets the decision vacated on review by the full seventh circuit and i hope ims will try the case will go to trial does this meet the legal standard for a retaliation claim a retaliation claim requires  protected activity  adverse employment action and  a “causal connection” between the protected activity and the adverse action everyone agrees that ms greengrass engaged in protected activity by filing her original eeoc charge and making her internal complaint as well the seventh circuit found and the district court assumed that the public disclosure of ms greengrass’s charge and her resulting inability to get another job was an “adverse employment action” but the district court found there was no reason to believe that ims made the disclosure “because of” ms greengrass’s eeoc charge the seventh circuit panel on the other hand believed that there was enough evidence of causation to send the case to a jury the appeals panel found that the timing was suspicious because the disclosure was made after the eeoc had indicated that it was ramping up the investigation although the court seems to have missed the fact that the “ramping up” had actually occurred much earlier and that the first sec filing afterward did not identify ms greengrass the court also found that the general counsel’s email which should never have been disclosed in the first place “evinced disdain for the eeoc process and animus against greengrass for filing her complaint” the court also took into account communications that were made when ms greengrass’s original internal harassment complaint was made — two years before the sec disclosure finally the court found that ims’s flipflopping on whether to disclose litigants by name was evidence of pretext even though the company said the flipflopping was because of conflicting advice it had received from “auditors and others” the lower court opinion notes that a cparisk management employee at ims expressed concern about disclosing the detailed information which resulted in the change back to leaving the names off the appeals court doesn’t mention this “who needs this i’m outta here” editorial comment this is the kind of thing that makes american companies want to move to the cayman islands ims was arguably damned if it didn’t by the sec and damned if it did by the eeoc an employer that is trying in good faith to comply with complex and potentially conflicting regulatory schemes should not have to go to trial for retaliation if it “overcomplies” – especially when the regulation in question says that “the principal parties” have to be disclosed  i don’t know enough about sec regulations to even be dangerous but i am sure that they are open to a good deal of interpretation and that what a company ought to disclose will often depend on whom it’s asking what day of the week it is and what the weather is like a lot like consulting with two or more lawyers on the same question i hope that ims will get a rehearing and a better result next time but meanwhile employers should consider themselves warned lesson  yes you can be liable for retaliation against someone who doesn’t even work for you any more this issue has been settled since the s so be careful about the way you treat exemployees as well as current employees lesson  whenever you are required to disclose pending litigation or administrative charges avoid saying anything more than absolutely necessary and be consistent lesson  if you decide that you should change your past practice be sure you have thoroughly documented the reason for the change the date of the consultation in which the change was recommended and the name of the auditor or consultant who advised you to make the change in other words make sure you have plenty of evidence that your decision to make a change was based on nothing other than your adviser’s opinion about what the law required you to do lesson  who knew it’s now retaliatory to say that a legal action filed against an employer is “meritless” and that it “will vigorously defend” rant over am i off base your comments are much appreciated      and also of interest     don’t delay on those hb applications ‘tis the season as will

willamor alex this article is so pro employer that it makes me puke and has no legal standing and worse yet is idiotic advise ims was sued because it maliciously ruined the prior employees’ chances to seek employment ims conduct throughout the sexual harassment complaint process was one of retaliation and humiliation of the complainant and in the end ims wanted to retaliate against the complainant in revenge for the complaint and the settlement typically i see this conduct in federal agencies but this is one is new because it comes from a corporation well done complainant ims should be ashamed of itself by the way ims blames its attorneys and other counsel for bad advice lets get this clear the defendant and the plaintiff are always responsible for their conduct whether it failed to take action or whether it took the wrong action… is all ims by the way i am not an attorney but common sense tells me that this article is biased and idiotic somewhat deceivingly cute but misguided insiderblog thanks for writing alex the thing about the sexual harassment claim is that it was settled all the company did here was list the pending charge in its sec filing as it was required to do by law that is the problem that i have with the court’s decision alex thanks for your response but i disagree that ims had to disclose the complainant’s name in the manner that it did through an sec filing normally when there is a settlement agreement the only way that allows disclosure is through a court order i betcha a dime and a nickel that the settlement agreement did not allow for disclosure unless there was a court order and in this case i saw no evidence of a court order to disclose the complainant’s name specially in the manner that ims did with malice aforethought for they had to know or should have known about the adverse actions their disclosure predicated that adversely affected the complainant’s potential for seeking employment ims damaged the complainant twice  sexual harassment and  retaliation so now it has to pay again… however you seem to be stuck on the sec filing without looking at the whole picture and the damages to the complainant sec filing cannot stand alone… ims cannot hide behind the sec filing… even a normal discovery filing does not protects ims… it has to be a court order where the complainant also has the right to object ihlwyrs you’re not a lawyer but you claim to know all these things how arrogant christa imho the problem was that they stated in a public document that the charge was “meritless” and that statement is tied to her name i wouldn’t want to have “meritless charge” tied with my name insiderblog but christa if you were an employer how would you feel about a public document saying that you “discriminated and retaliated” against your employees doesn’t the employer have a right to defend itself too thanks robin frankie i agree with the author on this one – all the way insiderblog frankie thank you for the

unprecedented growth in capital flows and the resulting rapid financial center integration as well as faster communication before  london and paris existed as the worlds only prominent financial centers soon after berlin and new york grew to become major financial centres an array of smaller financial centers became important as they found market niches such as amsterdam brussels zurich and geneva london remained the leading international financial center in the four decades leading up to world war i–– the first modern wave of economic globalization began during the period of – marked by transportation expansion record levels of migration enhanced communications trade expansion and growth in capital transfers during the midnineteenth century the passport system in europe dissolved as

absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steampowered boats over traditional sailing ships world railway mileage grew from  kilometers in  to  kilometers in  while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the s advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy the precursor to radio revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication in  the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect london and new york while europe and asia became connected through new landlines– economic globalization grew

a return to protectionism between  and  in  german chancellor otto von bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods making germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies in  france introduced the méline tariff greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods the united states maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century imposing customs duties between  and  on imported goods despite these measures international trade continued to grow without slowing paradoxically foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the united kingdom– unprecedented growth in foreign investment from the s to the s served as the core driver of financial globalization the worldwide total of capital invested abroad amounted to us billion in   trillion in  dollars with the greatest share of foreign assets held by the united kingdom  france  germany  and the united states  the netherlands belgium and switzerland together held foreign investments on par with germany at around – panic of edit main

trust to close on october   provoking further reactions the panic was alleviated when us secretary of the treasury george b cortelyou and john pierpont jp morgan deposited  million and  million respectively into the reserve banks of new york city enabling withdrawals to be fully covered the bank run in new york led to a money market crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for credit heightened from cereal and grain exporters since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in london the international markets became exposed to the crisis the bank of england had to sustain an artificially high discount lending rate until  to service the flow of gold to the united states the bank of england organized a pool from among twentyfour different nations for which the banque de france temporarily lent £ million gbp  million in  gbp in gold– birth of the us federal reserve system edit main article federal reserve system the united states congress passed the federal reserve act in  giving rise to the federal reserve system its inception drew influence from the panic of  underpinning legislators hesitance in trusting individual investors such as john pierpont morgan to serve again as a lender of last resort the systems design also considered the findings of the pujo committees investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which wall streets concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations although the committees findings were inconclusive the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the longresisted notion of establishing a central bank the federal reserves overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the united states money supply during significant shifts in money demand in addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the  money market crunch new yorks banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks new access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches bolstering new yorks rivalry with londons competitive discount market– interwar period –edit see also hyperinflation in the weimar republic and world war i reparations german infantry crossing a battlefield in france in august  british soldiers resting before the battle of mons with german troops along the french border in august  economists have referred to the onset of world war i as the end of an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact the united kingdom declared war on germany on august   following germanys invasion of france and belgium in the weeks prior the foreign exchange market in london was the first to exhibit distress european tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from londons discount market as the money market tightened discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the bank of england rather than discounting new pounds sterling the bank of england was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from  on july  to  by august  as foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to london just to pay off their newly maturing securities the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies yet sharply depreciate against the french franc after french banks began liquidating their london accounts remittance to london became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of  usdgbp emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments a week later the bank of england began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the uk by depositing gold designated for a bank of england account with canadas minister of finance and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of  approximately  million usd in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months however pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills as the pound sterling was the worlds reserve currency and leading vehicle currency market illiquidity and merchant banks hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed– the uk government attempted several measures to revive the london foreign exchange market the most notable of which were implemented on september  to extend the previous moratorium through october and allow the bank of england to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon the end of the war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions by midoctober the london market began functioning properly as a result of the september measures the war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market such as the london stock exchanges prolonged closure the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments and myriad disruptions of freight and mail the pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout world war i in large part due to various steps taken by the uk government to influence the pounds value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities outbound capital controls and limited import restrictions– in  the allied

smoot–hawley tariff act us president herbert hoover signed the smoot–hawley tariff act into law on june   the tariffs aim was to protect agriculture in the united states but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs on a host of manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as  on over a thousand various goods twentyfive trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs on a wide range of us goods hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the republican partys  platform which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nations struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate the culmination of the stock market crash of  and the onset of the great depression heightened fears further pressuring hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of henry ford and over  economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act––– exports from the united states plummeted  from  to  worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt– the international ramifications of the smoothawley tariff comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the great depression formal abandonment of the gold standardedit main article gold standard income per capita throughout the great depression as viewed from an international perspective triangles mark points at which nations abandoned the gold standard by suspending gold convertibility or devaluing their currencies against gold the classical gold standard was established in  by the united kingdom as the bank of england enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion france germany the united states russia and japan each embraced the standard one by one from  to  marking its international acceptance the first departure from the standard occurred in august  when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes following the end of world war i on november   austria hungary germany russia and poland began experiencing hyperinflation having informally departed from the standard most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels a number of countries including the united states made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard the early years of the great depression brought about bank runs in the united states austria and germany which placed pressures on gold reserves in the united kingdom to such a degree that the gold standard became unsustainable germany became the first nation to formally abandon the postworld war i gold standard when the dresdner bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on july   in september  the united kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely by the end of  a host of countries including austria canada japan and sweden abandoned gold following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves the united states broke free of the gold standard in april  france would not follow suit until  as investors fled from the franc due to

disastrous effects of the smoot–hawley tariff proved difficult for herbert hoovers  reelection campaign franklin d roosevelt became the nd us president and the democratic party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization as an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports democrats advocated for trade reciprocity the us congress passed the reciprocal trade agreements act in  aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment the legislation expressly authorized president roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably if a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities the us would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations between  and  the us negotiated  such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period the legislation contained an important mostfavorednation clause through which tariffs were equalized to all countries such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates the clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates–– rise of the bretton woods financial order edit main article bretton woods system assistant us treasury secretary harry dexter white left and john maynard keynes honorary adviser to the uk treasury at the inaugural meeting of the international monetary funds board of governors in savannah georgia us march   as the inception of the united nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in  delegates from  of its early member states met at a hotel in bretton woods new hampshire for the united nations monetary and financial conference now commonly referred to as the bretton woods conference delegates remained cognizant of the effects of the great depression struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the s and related market instabilities whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates bretton woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility under this system nations would peg their exchange rates to the us dollar which would be convertible to gold at  usd per ounce this arrangement is commonly referred to as the bretton woods system rather than maintaining fixed rates nations would peg their currencies to the us dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a  band of the agreedupon parity to meet this requirement central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar– members could adjust their pegs in response to longrun fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies the adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment this feature grew from delegates experiences in the s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the great depression capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs an important component of the bretton woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions the international monetary fund imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd collectively referred to as the bretton woods institutions they became operational in  and  respectively the imf was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues providing advisory and technical assistance to members and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product from which emergency loans could be issued–– member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets but prohibited from relying on imf financing to cover particularly shortterm capital hemorrhages while the imf was instituted to guide members and provide a shortterm financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits the ibrd was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward longterm investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects the creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following world war ii– since the establishment of the international development association ida in  the ibrd and ida are together known as the world bank while the ibrd lends to middleincome developing countries the ida extends the banks lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the worlds poorest nations general agreement on tariffs and trade edit main article general agreement on tariffs and trade see also list of free trade agreements and list of international trade topics in   countries concluded the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt at a un conference in geneva delegates intended the agreement to suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a un body to be known as the international trade organization ito as the ito never became ratified gatt became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains the agreements structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services gatt was centered on two precepts trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory and subsidizing nonagricultural exports needed to be prohibited as such the agreements most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow gatt members in the event of any discovery of nonagricultural subsidies members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs the agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures however gatts principles did not extend to financial activity consistent with the eras rigid discouragement of capital movements– the agreements initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs while the us reduced its tariffs by one third other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions resurgence of financial globalizationedit flexible exchange rate regimes presentedit world reserves of foreign exchange and gold in billions of us dollars in  although the exchange rate stability sustained by the bretton woods system facilitated expanding international trade this early success masked its underlying design flaw wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade the system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late s and early s central banks needed more us dollars to hold as reserves but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs to accommodate these needs the bretton woods system depended on the united states to run dollar deficits as a consequence the dollars value began exceeding its gold backing during the early s investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in london than in the united states signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued belgianamerican economist robert triffin defined this problem now known as the triffin dilemma in which a countrys national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the worlds reserve currency– france voiced concerns over the artificially low price of gold in  and called for returns to the former gold standard meanwhile excess dollars flowed into international markets as the united states expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the vietnam war its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the th century in august  president richard nixon suspended the exchange of us dollars for gold as part of the nixon shock the closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar these influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies largely ineffective capital controls or floating exchange rates–– following these woes surrounding the us dollar the dollar price of gold was raised to  usd per ounce and the bretton woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of  as part of the smithsonian agreement signed by the g members in december  the agreement delayed the systems demise for a further two years– the systems erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred but also by the oil crises of the s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing once the worlds reserve currency began to float other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes– the postbretton woods financial order edit see also international monetary fund headquarters of the international monetary fund in washington dc as part of the first amendment to its articles of agreement in  the imf developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights sdrs which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the fund as an alternative to gold sdrs entered service in  originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded  the baskets composition changed over time and presently consists of the us dollar euro japanese yen chinese yuan and british pound beyond holding them as reserves nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the fund in sdrs although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade in international transactions the currency baskets portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates–– special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold the fund initially issued  billion xdr from  to – imf members signed the jamaica agreement in january  which ratified the end of the bretton woods system and reoriented the funds role in supporting the international monetary system the agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the smithsonian agreement measures in tandem with floating exchange rates the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility the agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to imf lending programs as a result the fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases reducing protective trade barriers and contractionary monetary policy–– the second amendment to the articles of agreement was signed in  it legally formalized the freefloating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the jamaica agreement and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy the postbretton woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime the amendment also expanded the institutions capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the fund on regime implementation– this role is called imf surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point in the evolution of the funds mandate which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries overall economic policies– under the dominance of flexible exchange rate regimes the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile in  newly elected us president ronald reagans administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits to finance these deficits the united states offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital as foreign investors demand for us dollars grew the dollars value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in february  the us trade deficit grew to  billion in   billion in  dollars as a result of the dollars strong appreciation the g met in september  at the plaza hotel in new york city and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the united states trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions in what became known as the plaza accord the us dollar continued to depreciate but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase to address these concerns the g now g held a summit in paris in  where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies in what became known as the louvre accord this accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the s with a strong us economic performance from  to  during the dotcom bubble after the  stock market correction of the dotcom bubble the countrys trade deficit

agreement member states of the european economic community adopted a narrower currency band of  for exchange rates among their own currencies creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel the snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel eec countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies in  the european monetary system ems phased out the currency snake the ems featured two key components the european currency unit ecu an artificial weighted average market basket of european union members currencies and the exchange rate mechanism erm a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies par values– the parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system denominated in terms of ecus the weights within the ecu changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket under the erm if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit within a  band both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix the requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the bretton woods system similarly to bretton woods however ems members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ecus value–– the central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances and were modified

nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles the general agreement on trade in services and agreements on intellectual property rights issues the key manifestation of this round was the marrakech agreement signed in april  which established the world trade organization wto the wto is a chartered multilateral trade organization charged with continuing the gatt mandate to promote trade govern trade relations and prevent damaging trade practices or policies it became operational in january  compared with its gatt secretariat predecessor the wto features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membershipbased and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations this function was designed to address prior weaknesses whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays obstruct negotiations or fall back on weak enforcement– in  wto

also currency crisis and sovereign default number of countries experiencing a banking crisis in each year since  this covers  countries the dramatic feature of this graph is the virtual absence of banking crises during the period of the bretton woods system  to  this analysis is similar to figure  in rogoff and reinhart  financial integration among industrialized nations grew substantially during the s and s as did liberalization of their capital accounts integration among financial markets and banks rendered benefits such as greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy the resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks– accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure to the public and to regulatory authorities– as economies became more open nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence given greater integration among nations a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others– the s and s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults including the  black monday stock market crashes  european monetary system crisis  mexican peso crisis  asian currency crisis  russian financial crisis and the – argentine peso crisis––– these crises differed in terms of their breadth causes and aggravations among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nations fiscal policy selffulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nations currency peg lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems following research of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the s economists have reached a consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies healthy fiscal policy robust bank regulations and strong legal protection of property rights economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment liberalizing domestic equity capital and embracing capital outflows and shortterm capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework an emerging market economy must develop a credible currency in the eyes of both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity greater savings at higher interest rates and accelerated economic growth if a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops which carry serious economic and social costsxii countries sought to improve the sustainability and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the s and s the basel committee on banking supervision was formed in  by the g members central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices it is headquartered at the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland the committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the basel accords the first of these accords known as basel i took place in  and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes basel i was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated stemming from observations during the s latin american debt crisis following basel i the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks which the g nations implemented four years later in  the g established the financial stability forum reconstituted by the g in  as the financial stability board to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system the forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof– the basel ii accord was set in  and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk as well as the need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally it was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies members were slow to implement it with major efforts by the european union and united states taking place as late as  and –– in  the basel committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to basel ii known as basel iii which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks in addition to strengthening the ratio basel iii modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings concluding the capital threshold should be set at  of the value of a banks riskweighted assets birth of the european economic and monetary union edit main article economic and monetary union of the european union in february  european union countries signed the maastricht treaty which outlined a threestage plan to accelerate progress toward an economic and monetary union emu the first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries the second stage established the european monetary institute which was ultimately dissolved in tandem with the establishment in  of the european central bank ecb and european system of central banks key to the maastricht treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that eu members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed the third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the euro adopted by eleven of thenfifteen members of the european union in january  in doing so they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy these countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders exchangeable for euros at fixed rates until  when the ecb began issuing official euro coins and notes as of update the emu comprises  nations which have issued the euro and  noneuro states––– global financial crisisedit main articles financial crisis of – and great recession following the market turbulence of the s financial crises and september  attacks on the us in  financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products worldwide international capital flows grew from  trillion to  trillion us dollars from  to  primarily in the form of shortterm money market instruments the united states experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders in the wake of the gramm–leach–bliley act of  which repealed the glass–steagall act of  ending limitations on commercial banks investment banking activity industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries as reflected by global imbalances which grew to  of gross world product in  from  in – the global financial crisis precipitated in  and  shared some of the key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the s including accelerated capital influxes weak regulatory frameworks relaxed monetary policies herd behavior during investment bubbles collapsing asset prices and massive deleveraging the systemic problems originated in the united states and other advanced nations– similarly to the  asian crisis the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries particularly in the united states the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of nonperforming assets large fiscal deficits and excessive financing in the housing sector–– while the real estate bubble in the us triggered the financial crisis the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries as its contagious effects began infecting other nations the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the great recession in the wake of the crisis total volume of world trade in goods and services fell  from  to  and did not recover until  with an increased concentration in emerging market countries the global financial crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether eurozone crisisedit main articles european debt crisis and great recession in europe in  a newly elected government in greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data and that its fiscal deficit for the year was  of gdp as opposed to the  espoused by the previous administration this news alerted markets to the fact that greeces deficit exceeded the eurozones maximum of  outlined in the economic and monetary unions stability and growth pact investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold greek bonds given greeces prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight the crisis proved contagious when it spread to portugal italy and spain together with greece these are collectively referred to as the pigs ratings agencies downgraded these countries debt instruments in  which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts the crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a european sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery in the wake of the great recession in tandem with the imf the european union members assembled a € billion bailout for greece and other afflicted nations additionally the ecb pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic the crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in europe contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises during the initial waves of the crisis the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro german federal minister of finance wolfgang schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone now commonly referred to as the eurozone crisis it has been ongoing since  and most recently began encompassing the – cypriot financial crisis–– implications of globalized capitaledit balance of paymentsedit main article balance of payments the top five annual current account deficits and surpluses in billions of us dollars for the year  based on data from the organisation for economic cooperation and development the balance of payments accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions the balance of payments is a function of three components transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account– the current account summarizes three variables the trade balance net factor income from abroad and net unilateral transfers the financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given the capital account also includes the official reserve account which summarizes central banks purchases and sales of domestic currency foreign exchange gold and sdrs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves––– because the balance of payments sums to zero a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa a current account surplus or deficit indicates the extent to which a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments and whether it is living beyond its means for example assuming a capital account balance of zero thus no asset transfers available for financing a current account deficit of £ billion implies a financial account surplus or net asset exports of £ billion a net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower exchanging future payments for current consumption further a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a countrys debt from this perspective the balance of payments links a nations income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital which illuminates how a nations wealth is shaped over time– a healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth if countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments demand can slow leading to unused or excess supply discouraged foreign investment and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances– a countrys external wealth is measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities a current account surplus and corresponding financial account deficit indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets shifts in a nations external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender or creditor in the world economy while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower or debtor unique financial risksedit main article systemic risk nations and international businesses face an array of financial risks unique to foreign investment activity political risk is the potential for losses from a foreign countrys political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments which manifests in different forms transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a countrys capital controls and balance of payments operational risk characterizes concerns over a countrys regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments for example foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreignheld assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investors decision to acquire assets in the host country– country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends participantsedit economic actorsedit see also list of multinational corporations and list of investment banks each of the core economic functions consumption production and investment have become highly globalized in recent decades while consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy international financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad– consumers multinational corporations individual and institutional investors and financial intermediaries such as banks are the key economic actors within the global financial system central banks such as the european central bank or the us federal reserve system undertake open market operations in their efforts to realize monetary policy goals–– international financial institutions such as the bretton woods institutions multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives trade organizations such as the world trade organization institute of international finance and the world federation of exchanges attempt to ease trade facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs promote standards and sponsor research and statistics publications regulatory bodiesedit see also list of financial regulatory authorities by country explicit goals of financial regulation include countries pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors a single nation with functioning governance financial regulations deposit insurance emergency financing through discount windows standard accounting practices and established legal and disclosure procedures can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system in a global context however no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally rather governments have cooperated to establish a host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecturexviii within this architecture regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations have the capacity to influence international financial markets national governments may employ their finance ministries treasuries and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets– some degree of selfregulation occurs whereby banks and other financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral organizations such as the international monetary fund or the bank for international settlements particularly the basel committee on banking supervision and the committee on the global financial system– further examples of international regulatory bodies are the financial stability board fsb established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries the international organization of securities commissions iosco which coordinates the regulation of financial securities the international association of insurance supervisors iais which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision the financial action task force on money laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing and the international accounting standards board iasb which publishes accounting and auditing standards public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments such as the paris club and london club– national securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries foreign exchange market activities– two examples of supranational financial regulators in europe are the european banking authority eba which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators and the european shadow financial regulatory committee esfrc which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations research organizations and other foraedit research and academic institutions professional associations and thinktanks aim to observe model understand and publish recommendations to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system for example the independent nonpartisan world economic forum facilitates the global agenda council on the global financial system and global agenda council on the international monetary system which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations the global financial markets association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world the group of thirty g formed in  as a private international group of consultants researchers and representatives committed to advancing understanding of international economics and global finance future of the global financial systemedit the imf has reported that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes one challenge is managing the united states disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy doing so in an elegant orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility or by structural deleveraging in shortterm securities and in the shadow banking system particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years some nations however such as japan are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures the eurozones nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments yet some european nations such as portugal italy and spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth so as not to provoke investor withdrawalxixiii the global financial crisis and great recession prompted renewed discourse on the architecture of the global financial system these events called to attention financial integration inadequacies of global governance and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization– since the establishment in  of a formal international monetary system with the imf empowered as its guardian the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically this has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate increasing the complexities of the imf and world banks mandates– the lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rulebased governance of financial activities french economist and executive director of the world economic forums reinventing bretton woods committee marc uzan has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a global central bank or a world financial authority have been deemed impractical leading to further consideration of mediumterm efforts to improve transparency and disclosure strengthen emerging market financial climates bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets he has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions resources– the council on foreign relations assessment of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms are the two key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination and global savings imbalances have abounded before and after the global financial crisis to the extent that the united states status as the steward of the worlds reserve currency was called into question postcrisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized the lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the worlds ability to prevent future global financial crises the slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet basel iii criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until  rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks despite basel iii and other efforts by the g to bolster the financial stability boards capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels reform effortsedit former world bank chief economist and former chairman of the us council of economic advisers joseph e stiglitz referred in the late s to a growing consensus that something is wrong with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great number of people who are hardly even participants in international financial markets neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies he argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout although crises can be overcome by emergency financing employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries and the high costs damage standards of living stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing shortterm international capital flows without adversely affecting longterm foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies american economist and former chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker has argued that the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system he has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures increased policy surveillance by the imf and commitment from nations to adopt agreedupon best practices mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities such as those offered by the imf or by central banks and improved incentive structures with financial penalties governor of the bank of england and former governor of the bank of canada mark carney has described two approaches to global financial reform shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions as well as better measurement and management of risks the g agreed to new standards presented by the basel committee on banking supervision at its  summit in pittsburgh pennsylvania the standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by basel ii improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must bear the burden of financial losses during future financial crises and such occurrences should be welldefined and preplanned he suggested other national regulators follow canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed living wills which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure world leaders at the  g summit in seoul south korea endorsed the basel iii standards for banking regulation at its  summit in seoul south korea the g collectively endorsed a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by basel iii andreas dombret of the executive board of deutsche bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size complexity and degree of interconnectivity within the global financial system and that efforts should be made to identify a group of  to  indisputable globally systemic institutions he has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by basel iii and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system president of the federal reserve bank of new york and vice chairman of the federal open market committee william c dudley has argued that a global financial system regulated on a largely national basis is untenable for supporting a world economy with global financial firms in  he advocated five pathways to improving the safety and security of the global financial system a special capital requirement for financial institutions deemed systemically important a level playing field which discourages exploitation of disparate regulatory environments and beggar thy neighbour policies that serve national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability superior cooperation among regional and national regulatory regimes with broader protocols for sharing information such as records for the trade of overthecounter financial derivatives improved delineation of the responsibilities of the home versus the host country when banks encounter trouble and welldefined procedures for managing emergency liquidity
