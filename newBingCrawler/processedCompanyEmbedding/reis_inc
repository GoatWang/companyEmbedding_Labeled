were to be brought in that had the ability to lead innovate and motivate its employeesconsall of the executive leadership of the company have no presence in the industry completely lack leadership skills offer no strategic vision they consider minor long overdue product upgrades to be revolutionary new products and worst of all encourage a gossipy dreary infighting environment rather than one of team work and high motivation they prefer to sit in their offices rather than attend industry events engage their customers and prospects and believe they are above listening to their employees rather than admit to their continual string of errors and lack of innovation they choose to blame the employees for their ongoing failuresadvice to managementmy advice would be for the founding partners  your loyalty to your executive team is admirable but if you want growth it is time for change you have made numerous changes to your organization both individual contributors and middle management to no avail  at some point your executive team must be accountable rather than passing the buck to those below them you need executive leadership that can innovate and one that your

about quantity over quality and does not instill any positive reinforcement into their employees not quite sure how they sustain a business model in which the actual product they are providing clients has little to do with quality depth or accuracy at reis we are quite literally told to not take our times on our work but instead to rush so we can complete more did i mention our performance is based solely on the amount rather than any other factor doesnt make for a very accomplished feeling also the positive reviews on this site are from management who monitors this and makes sure to negate any

immediately available to existing and new subscribers as an additional module through the companys reis subscriber edition platform the company made the announcement at the naiop development  conference in scottsdale arizona the product rollout significantly improves investor perspectives on the us industrial sector until now industrial market information has been characterized by poor definitions of competitive inventory lack of critical submarket and propertylevel resolution and data collection methods that generate more questions than answers we address all of these issues said reiss chief executive officer lloyd lynford by diligently classifying each industrial property according to the key factors that determine its comparability to peers geographic submarket functional use and renter versus owneroccupied status by rigorously adhering to these quality control measures reis avoids problems associated with other sources including underestimating a markets vacancy rate and producing trends of questionable relevance and accuracy and of course only through the careful classification of the many types of industrial properties is it possible to provide meaningful rent and sales comparables reports a fundamental tool for anyone involved in a commercial real estate sale or lease transaction reiss chief operating officer bill sander cited subscriber demand as the driving factor behind the enhancement reis is ever attentive to the needs of our longterm clients many of whom have expressed their frustration at the quality of the industrial market data they were receiving from other sources we saw an opportunity to advance the practice of industrial analysis by applying to this sector the same comprehensive data collection methodology that has made reis the

constant product innovation as a driver of stockholder value over the last four years we have introduced eleven major expansions of coverage that have driven the growth of our business mr sander said
