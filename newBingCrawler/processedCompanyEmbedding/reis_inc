worked at reis fulltime more than a yearprosthe product is a market leader and is essential to many cre professionals daily workconsthe company is sadly losing what has made it great as sales have dropped off due to market saturation they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process this is routinely discussed on quarterly analyst calls and the results havent met expectations unfortunately these efforts have been less than successful and have created unintended consequences with a mass exodus of sales talent leaving the company either by choice or termination morale is at an all time low with those staff remaining racing for the exits as quickly as possible as the damage created is irreparableadvice to managementseek advice from your employees so many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most its so disappointing because you really did have an incredibly loyal and proud workforce

collection of historical cre data that could be the foundation for solid company growth if an executive team were to be brought in that had the ability to lead innovate and motivate its employeesconsall of the executive leadership of the company have no presence in the industry completely lack leadership skills offer no strategic vision they consider minor long overdue product upgrades to be revolutionary new products and worst of all encourage a gossipy dreary infighting environment rather than one of team work and high motivation they prefer to sit in their offices rather than attend industry events engage their customers and prospects and believe they are above listening to their employees rather than admit to their continual string of errors and lack of innovation they choose to blame the employees for their ongoing failuresadvice to managementmy advice would be for the founding partners  your loyalty to your executive team is admirable but if you want growth it is time for change you have made numerous changes to your organization both individual contributors and middle management to no avail  at some point your executive team must be accountable rather than passing the buck to those below them you need executive leadership that can innovate and one that your employees will respect and followshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via

their employees not quite sure how they sustain a business model in which the actual product they are providing clients has little to do with quality depth or accuracy at reis we are quite literally told to not take our times on our work but instead to rush so we can complete more did i mention our performance is based solely on the amount rather than any other factor doesnt make for a very accomplished feeling also the positive reviews on this site are from management who monitors this and makes sure to negate any true review like the one you are reading with a very untrue inaccurate

commercial real estate sales trend and forecast analyses new york october   new yorkbusiness wirereis inc nasdaq reis today responded to the current banking and financial crisis by launching reis transaction analytics™ a tool that empowers commercial real estate investors and portfolio managers to identify sales and capital markets trends that are directly impacting the value of their assets the resulting precision supports more informed valuations and decisions with regard to troubled debt and associated commercial real estate collateral at a time when economic distress is prompting market participants to continually revalue their holdings transaction analytics™ frees investors and portfolio managers from a dependence on broader measures of real estate capital market activity such as the average cap rate in a metropolitan area which typically mask market volatility many portfolio managers and investors are used to relying on overall metro indications of value simply because that is what they have had to work with in the past said michael richardson reiss senior vice president of sales and marketing transaction analytics™ allows users to dig beneath the market averages for a closer look at the relevant trends in asset values for all of reiss metro areas and regions users of transaction analytics™ can obtain on demand a customized read on historical current and forecasted capital market conditions offering key measurements of sales transaction activity including mean median and month rolling cap rates total sales price price per unit or square foot and total transaction volume the user may refine this analysis by including only properties that meet specified sales transaction characteristics price or cap rate or physical characteristics size age or class all property level transactions are accessible within the module providing complete transparency transaction analytics™ unleashes the full power of the reis sales comparables database said reis product manager kevin varley at a time when there is a virtually unprecedented interest in all things real estate this module addresses the critical questions that influence the valuation of commercial properties reis has a deep tradition of helping its clients respond to crises with facts and data we helped the resolution trust corporation assign value to billions of dollars worth of troubled debt collateral in the early s since that time we have maintained continuity of leadership while developing a wealth of property level research making reis uniquely qualified to offer
