mechel begins development of bulk ingot market share it  july moscow russia – july   – mechel pao moex mtlr nyse mtl a leading russian mining and metals company reports that chelyabinsk metallurgical plant has cast its first oversize tonne ingot the new technology for production of bulk ingots from specialty steels will enable chelyabinsk metallurgical plant to enter a new segment of the oversize product market and make supplies both domestically and internationallybulk ingots are produced by very few companies globally as their production requires equipment capable of simultaneous casting of necessary volumes of quality steel while maintaining special temperatures and speed in pouring steel into a mould the mould is also technically difficult to produce with the plant’s mould developed by the plant’s own experts who managed to attain maximum precision in its making the plant has produced bulk ingots before but their maximum weight reached  tonnes chelyabinsk metallurgical plant’s tonne ingots will be supplied as billets to mechel’s another steel facility urals stampings plant urals stampings plant will use them to produce a new type of product — bulk forgings which are highly in demand in mechanical engineering “production of a highquality tonne ingot is an event of strategic importance for mechel’s steel division today only a few facilities in russia and abroad can produce such ingots while streamlining this production process our experts applied groundbreaking design engineering and technical solutions we plan to build on this development as we see stable demand for this type of product” mechel pao’s chief executive officer oleg korzhov commented  mechel pao ekaterina videman tel       ekaterinavidemanmechelcom  mechel is an international mining and steel company
