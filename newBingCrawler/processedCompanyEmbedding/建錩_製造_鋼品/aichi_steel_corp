attachments employ several innovative core technologies developed by aichi steel corporation for the toyota group we are a leader in magnetic materials technology which not only allows for the continued advancement of magnetic attachments but for the research and development of new applications of magnetics in the dental field strongest retention in its class with an ultracompact size the attractive force performance properties of magfit have been improved  times over conventional agnets this has been achieved with aichi steels cutting edge technology in magnetic circuit design optimization no corrosion aichi steels precision microlaser welding technology nables a perfect hermetic seal of the stainless steel outer casing which protects the magnet from corrosion in the oral environment new magnetic materials technology the success of magfit was also built upon the development of aum aichi steels proprietary soft magnetic stainless steel developed for the dental field patent no jp67 which has superior magnetic properties and corrosion resistance and the use of the worlds strongest ndfeb magnetclosed circuit design assures the patients safety without harmful biomagnetic effects  million sets of magfit sold over the last decade first introduced in  magfit has been applied to over  patients who have enjoyed the merits and convenience of a magnetically retained overdenturemagfit is available in  countries worldwide magnetretained implant supported overdentures with the increasing number of the clinical application of implants magnetretained implant supported overdentures are highly anticipated for edentulous patients magfit ip magnetic attachments are compatible with major implant systems making it possible to apply this practical treatment product quality assurance all magfit products are ce approved and manufactured in japan with isoiso certification controlled lot numbers are laseretched on all magfit magnetic assemblies for

the worlds highest energy product for a bonded magnet and a high heat resistance of up to °c   the ndfeb magnet which was discovered in  is produced as a sintered magnet by many manufacturers worldwide and as an isotropic powder for bonded magnets originally by magnequench ever since those early years an anisotropic bonded magnet with a much higher energy product had been desired to fill the performance range between these two classes of material and to enable a more efficient use of expensive raw materials   aichi steel discovered and refined the only commercial production technology for anisotropic magnet powder which is called dhddr treatment and succeeded in the mass production of anisotropic powders for bonded magnets as well as the techniques for manufacturing high performance magnets the name magfine mf is derived from the combination of magnet and the fine microstructure of our dhddr magnet powder   to download a brochure of technical information and
