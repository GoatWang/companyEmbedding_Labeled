product is used in the following cases poscothainox pcl taiyuan iron  steel co ltd tisco aceros inoxidables olarra sa rabirun vinimay pvt ltd rvpl more products at sa sdm sa acid manager sa   scanacon’s flagship benchtop analyser the sa builds upon the basic atsat by incorporating automatic density determination sophisticated software with statistical process control spc functionality and the capability to track up to  individual acid processes   the sa acid manager is a semiautomatic benchtop analysis system that allows for a quick and accurate analysis of free acid and dissolved metals the concentration of any mixed acid solution of hso hcl or hno in conjunction with hf and the total concentration dissolved metal ions can be determined in less than two minutes and reported as either gl wt or molar   powerful statistical process control spc software allows the sa to track up to  individual acid recipes while the softwares automatic control chart plotting allows operations to quickly access the current state of the process when actions are necessary to bring the process into the control range the sa software automatically calculates the required raw acid dosage water addition or dump volume built in opc server software can transmit data to a pc or plc for automatic process control  ie the scanacon continuous acid dosing cados system   adding to the sa functionality all analytical results including calibrations check standards and samples are logged in a historical database and may be reviewed at any time plotted on control charts or exported as raw data the historical database combined with the spc software allows operations to quickly access and address variations in the acid process or alternatively offers the assurance the acid process was in compliance if variations in quality control qc occur   like the ats and at the sa analytical method is based on density and specially designed ionselective electrodes   an automatic density meter densitometer is used to take the reading of the sample density in addition the densitometer also functions to dilute and cool the sample in preparation for the ion analysis   three electrodes  two ionselective for h f and one reference electrode are used the potential difference measured between the ion selective electrode and the reference is used to determine the specific ion activity to compensate for temperature dependence in ion activity a thermocouple measures the temperature in the sample during the test   concentrations of free acid are calculated as a function of ion activity total metals are calculated as a function of free acid concentration and density   calibration of the sa is by iso certified solutions and is accomplished quickly and easily the sa userinterface automatically prompts the operator through the calibration procedure and verifies the result   based on user defined process parameters of acid concentration metal concentration and process volume the sa software calculates the necessary raw acid addition required to maintain the process at the target concentrations the sa can track and control up to  unique acid processes copied poscothainox

the background   poscothainox public company limited poscothainox thailand’s only manufacturer and distributor of premium coldrolled stainless steel sheets and coils was founded on  july  as a joint venture between world leading steel industry groups from france arcelor japan nippon steel and thai investors on  september  posco global steel and stainless steel maker acquired thainox   poscothainox’s manufacturing facility is the first and the most advanced of its kind in the entire asean region   currently poscothainox possesses an annual production capacity of  tons to better serve the company’s existing customer base as well as support its growth and rising demands for stainless steel consumption a capacity increase to  tons is planned   poscothainox supplies  of its premiumquality stainless steel products for applications in various industries domestically and exports  of its output to more than  countries across the globe through strong networks since its establishment poscothainox has increased its domestic and global market share at an annual compounded growth rate of    the challenge   as poscothainox annual production increased so too did acid consumption waste water generation and other environmental liabilities given these challenges poscothainox sought technology that could reduce hso and hnohf pickling acid consumption the environmental impact of nox emissions waste water generation and waste sludge as well as improve production availability of the annealing and pickling lines improved surface quality of the finished product was also an important consideration     the scanacon solution   scanacon has been instrumental in achieving poscothainox goals supplying various pieces of acid management equipment initially scanacon supplied a sa acid manager acid recovery filtration and acid circulation on the cold rolled annealing  pickling line capl when the hot rolled annealing  pickling line hapl was installed the same acid management technologies from scanacon were included from the design stage   the result   more than  hf and  hno are saved annually and nox emission is kept under the control limit without any “denox” unit required a wastesludge landfill reduction of  as been achieved importantly with scanacon finishing process control line uptime productivity and quality is continually ensured   scope of work   scanacon supplied a complete acid management solution to poscothainox including   • engineering • sa acid manager • sa automatic acid analyzer • cyclosafu • sar moduflex • commissoning • training
