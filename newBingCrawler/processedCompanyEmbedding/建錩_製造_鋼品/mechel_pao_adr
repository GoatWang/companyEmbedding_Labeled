products but also enabled the plant to increase output of plates and coils of corrosionresistant steel grades competing in quality with the products of the leading european producers after reconstruction of the plant’s rolling facilities such products are not manufactured in russia so the complex’s launch allowed russia to significantly cut down on imports and even exclude them in some cases in september russian prime minister vladimir putin commissioned a new electric steelmaking complex at izhstal oao commissioning of the new facility will mark complete transition of izhstal oao to electric furnace steelmaking this is one of the key stages for the plant’s largescale technical upgrade program which provides for renovation of steelmaking complex and modernization of steel rolling facilities of izhstal oao technical modernization of the plant will result in more effective production reduced costs compliance with global quality standards and will allow us to satisfy the

tonnes of steam coal over  million tonnes of iron ore concentrate over  million tonnes of coke over  million tonnes of steel  tonnes of hardware  tonnes of nickel  tonnes of ferrosilicon  tonnes of ferrochrome and over  billion kwh of electric power production plummeted to its worst in the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  production of coking coal went down by over  and of iron ore concentrate by  throughout  the situation was steadily improving in ’s third quarter coking coal production more than doubled compared to the second quarter despite hardships all mechel enterprises continued working in february  demand for some of the company’s products grew which enabled mechel to increase the plants’ load for example steel plants were loaded  despite the crisis mechel signed several longterm contracts such as the fiveyear agreement to supply south korea’s hyundai steel with coking coal signed in march it is necessary to note that mechel’s steel plants were in a markedly better position than their counterparts due to a common wellbalanced production chain from raw material production to high valueadded products the most significant issues were being resolved centrally through mechel’s structure however the company halted most of its investment programs due to the crisis those programs were resumed once the market stabilized and in the order of importance for the company’s business despite the crisis mechel continued to implement its top priority projects chelyabinsk metallurgical plant was preparing for the construction of the universal rolling mill construction of the spurtrack to the elga deposit continued as well as reconstruction of izhstal’s steelproducing facilities which began a year earlier mechel’s own service and sales

romanian assets were named for their home towns — mechel targoviste and mechel campia turzii respectively in september  korshunov mining plant joined mechel the plant was bankrupt since  and had to halt production completely in april  as its chief customer refused to pay both the enterprise and its staff were faced with lack of customers and so lack of means to survive this had an immediate impact on the social situation in irkutsk region’s town of zheleznogorskiliymsky as the city budget was directly dependent on the plant strategic partnership with mechel helped dispel the crisis iron ore concentrate produced by korshunov mining plant was since then shipped to the urals with mechel investing in the plant and the town’s social policies finally the plant made a settlement with its creditors the plant made a good addition to the mechel family and could use the advantages of cooperation between mining and steel plants korshunov mining plant began increasing production levels and launched a largescale technical revamping program in october the mechel team acquired a lithuanian hardware plant dubbed mechel nemunas the plant produces hardware products — wire mesh and nails — for domestic market by the end of  mechel owned  enterprises in  mechel produced over  million tonnes of coal some  million tonnes of iron ore concentrate over  million tonnes of coke over  million tonnes of steel some  tonnes of hardware and some  tonnes of nickel  in  beloretsk metallurgical plant vyartsilya metal products plant and the plant in romania’s city of targoviste joined the group at the
