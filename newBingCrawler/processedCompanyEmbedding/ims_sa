ghz this is a discontinued product please note the following successor products rs®osp open switch and control platform overview options key facts signal source signal switching power measurement features components signal generation power measurement key facts compact the integrated measurement system rs ims offers everything needed in a modern ems test system signal source signal switching power measurement control and switching for up to three amplifiers including interlock rs® ims operating system fully compliant test software for ems and emi measurements integrated amplifier spectrum analyzer wide range of applications a compact instrument for ems measurements for commercial standards military standards automotive standards measurements supporting development certification measurements efficient and flexible easy test setup – only a few additional components required compact design – low space requirements – easy installation plug  play – connect controller via usb interface and start measurements costefficient fully automatic measurements further extensions possible successor products successor products to the rs®ims are emcs and softwareoptions osp with suitable switch modules and smba features  benefits components the integrated measurement system rs® ims is a complete ems test system for compliance tests in accordance with commercial military and automotive standards from  khz to  ghz signal generation the analog modulation types am fm φm and pm are available the optional generator interlock relay rs® imsb makes it possible to insert a  ω termination rather than the generator signal if an interlock loop is open power measurement the power sensor rs® nrpz is used to measure forward and reflected power and to monitor for example injected current in the case of bulk current injection bci a fast wearfree pin diode switch allows switching between forward power reflected power and monitoring it is also used for system calibration additional power sensors can also be implemented option rs® imsb required spectrum analyzer module if the optional spectrum analyzer module rs® imsb is added frequencyselective power measurements can be performed this makes it possible for example to take harmonic components of the amplifier into account at the  db compression point another application is current monitoring with the bci method in the automotive range checking of the first five harmonics rf switching unit the rf switching unit handles the switching of all rs® ims rf paths for up to three amplifiers two amplifier outputs can be switched to two different transducers eg antennas current probes or connection points eg in anechoic chambers and shielded enclosures by means of the optional transfer relay rs® imsb internal amplifier module conducted measurements can be performed using an internal amplifier module rs® ims model  which has a frequency range of  khz to  mhz the minimum amplifier power of  w cw lin permits measurements with couplingdecoupling networks cdn at a test voltage of  v in accordance with en  external amplifiers amplifiers with an authorized usb control eg from bonn elektronik gmbh can be integrated into the system via plug  play up to three amplifiers can be controlled and connected interlock the rs® ims operating system supports the control of an interlock loop for monitoring security functions during the ems measurement eg door contacts and amplifier status eut monitoring to allow eut monitoring during the emc test the rs® ims has four digital inputs these inputs can be queried either individually or together to allow eut stimulation the rs® ims provides four digital outputs static values or pulse signals ims operating system complete emc package the rs® ims operating system supports measurements for determining conducted and radiated susceptibility and emission on terminal equipment modules and integrated circuits a complete ems test system is obtained by adding just a few extra components the intuitive graphical user interface makes learning and operating the system easy the measurement philosophy is designed for compliance and batch tests with high eut throughput as well as for interactive tests supporting development applications range from development and conformance tests to production and quality assurance electromagnetic susceptibility – ems the factoryready test sequences can be adapted to lab instruments either interactively or via the con guration wizard the online help provides stepbystep instructions for all tasks from configuring the setup to performing measurements during susceptibility tests integrated control mechanisms limit the susceptibility level to protect both the eut and the test system from being overloaded ems measurement features for automotive applications the following list contains various measurement functions for generating interference that are implemented specifically for the automotive industry the test specifications for conducted susceptibility bci call for the measurement of amplifier harmonics and the limiting of the current susceptibility level to make this possible the rs® ims operating system offers a function for monitoring harmonics via a spectrum analyzer or test receiver this function can also be used to check an amplifier parallel measurement of the forward and reflected power and the susceptibility level helps boost measurement speed and eut throughput to ensure the reproducibility of test results the rs® ims operating system supports the tem cell attenuation measurement required in iso  userdefined equations make it possible to calculate additional single quantities from the current measured values for example the system impedance of a bci test setup eut monitoring and stimulation in addition to generating interference the ems measurement software is responsible for monitoring where the two main tasks are stimulation and monitoring of the eut the following integrated stimulus functions make it possible to control the eut at defined points in the test sequence changing the eut to a defined state eg switching it on or off when a measurement is started or stopped triggering an action of the eut at specific frequencies or at each test frequency and using the monitoring functions to check the euts response to the effects of the interference resetting the eut to a defined state after a faulty eut response has been detected the monitoring functions of the rs® ims operating system permit fully automatic monitoring of the eut the objective is to obtain a go or nogo pass  fail result for the test frequency and the test level monitoring channels can be defined for this purpose a go  nogo decision is reached by using a definable threshold or a decision window the measured values are displayed in a result table or in a graph in addition a separate table is generated that contains only the nogo frequencies physical quantities voltage current frequency temperature can be monitored either acoustically sound level or visually camera in the case of tests in the automotive range vehicular bus systems can lin most flexray can also be monitored monitoring with measuring instruments if communication is via physical quantities measuring instruments oscilloscope ttl converter or voltmeter are used to monitor the euts output signals or inject a defined signal at its inputs usb rsc ttl inputs and outputs and software interfaces are possible automatic determination of immunity thresholds it is important – particularly in development – to determine maximum susceptibility versus frequency this fully automatic susceptibility measurement yields two susceptibility level characteristics hysteresis that show the susceptibility level at which the faulty eut response disappears and then reappears the extensive monitoring capabilities of the rs ims operating system allow this measurement task to be automated functional expansions the option concept of the ims os allows functional expansions for specific customer requirements by using the options of the rs emcs emc measurement software it is possible to perform measurements in reverberation chambers or measurements in line with mobile radio standards for example automatic ems test sequences are an important expansion option and allow further automation and thus a more efficient use of the test chambers an automatically controlled eut test can be performed using several parameters loops sequential test eg several types of modulation several turntable positions or several polarizations thank you your request was successfully sent we will get in touch with you soon your rohde  schwarz team get a quote inquiry please enter your
