managementbyseetharama rao v durbhaon january  format paperbackverified purchasethough this book covers some basic issues surrounding identity management the architecture part is very weak what i felt is that the author is confusing delivery management with the technology itself major sections of the book under the guise of governance are devoted to people and expectation management and politics rather than technology majority of what is discussed is applicable universally to execution of any project in any decent sized organization not that this books has nothing to offer on ima itself  but it is too generic and very little on actual technologyread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsexcellent complete and easy to

for itread morecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsincomplete and lacks the practical sidebycesingeon july  format kindle editioni selected this book based on an upcoming iam project id be involved in and on amazon reader recommendations overly positive as it turns out the book written around  is a bit outdated in some points but this is not too much of an issue given its focus governance broad principles of identity management high level theoretical guidelines of architecture sure it is a good refresh of the high level governance principles that should guide identity management projects from a managerial perspectivebut the book clearly lacks substance when it comes to the practical implementation while it is of some help during the planning phase of im projects it essentially stops where one wants to start conceptual approach theoretical design planning are one thing implementing is another totally absent here the book will not help in areas like dimensioning practical issues and pitfalls product evaluation actual design and architecture roi cost vs benefit and such it is totally lacking any how tothe book starts the traditional way explaining what digital identity is this is followed by about  chapters about the constituents of identity management including authentication trust integrity nonrepudiation and even digital rights management except for a very brief refresher i think these have no place here and they should have been summarized in one single chapter other books treat this much better and many readers will find this part to be a somewhat boring given it is background knowledge for any cissplevel security person the drm chapter chapter  and some other parts in this area are even irrelevant in my viewthis first part is followed by two chapters on  interoperability standards and  federating identity here again the interoperability standards goes into unneeded technical details and misses the point it is not giving the reader an understanding of the real issues interoperability for what purpose what are the issues how can we go about themon the other hand the federating identity chapter should probably be substantially expanded as it is the meat of what identity management is about today three or four chapters should probably be devoted to this and they should include practical examples of scenarios architectures it should be shown why identity federation is key but again the chapter does not go beyond very highlevel and theoretical principlesfinally the book concludes with about eight chapters on architecture governance policies and such while these give an idea of what is required in a well governed enterprise with an advanced maturity model once again these chapters lack real practical usability in addition this part is really not specific to identity management but is rather a short summary of what has to be done in terms of governance enterprise and reference architectures and policy managementhaving read the book im kind of disappointed facing a real project on identity management the reader will surely think good and now what do we do possibly it may make happy the highlevel manager only seeking to understand what identity management is about with no intention to get involved in the projectthis other reader prasad reddy summarizes it very well the book absolutely fails and falls short on explaining the identity management standards and technologies related to single signon federation provisioning and assurance from a realworld idms deployment perspective the book is truly misleading  why so many gave it  or  stars is unclear id hesitate between  and useless no but i will still have to look out for something more useable in real liferead morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsgood introduction to imabyben rothkeon november  format paperbackmany people who review their credit report for the first time are shocked to learn how many identities are linked to them even when there is no problem of identity theft it is not uncommon for people to have  or more names linked to their credit reports due to various errors including permutation of their namejust as it is difficult to maintain and manage identities in the real world it is difficult to maintain and manage digital identities as the digital economy is becoming more ubiquitous the need for a single federated identity is becoming more critical in digital identity phillip windley details the steps needed to develop an identity management architecture imaidentity management has become a pressing need in the past few years this has come about because networks and systems are no longer geared around a single infrastructure and businesses have become increasingly virtual and decentralized in previous years there were simply internal users today systems have internal users along with external users such as consultants contractors thirdparties customers collaborators and many more such requirements necessitate a welldesigned and planned imaso what is this thing called ima windley defines an ima as the coherent enterprisewide set of standards policies certifications and management activities that enable an organization to effectively manage digital identitiesima is also known as federated identity the book notes that the real challenge in developing a federated identity infrastructure is dealing with the various different hardware and software platforms where user accounts reside and working with different organizations and departments including the everincreasing amount of outsourcing when all of that is put together a single federated identity is not easy to come by if there is not an ima in placethe beauty of an ima is that it allows an organization to securely link and exchange identity information across partner supplier and customer organizations while having a single architecture this makes identity management seamlessthe first  chapters of digital identity do a good job of introducing the underlying concepts of an ima including security trust authentication access control and names and directories without an effective security infrastructure in place any ima deployed will not be fully effectiveone oddity though is that in chapter  the author defines cryptography as the science of making the cost of discovery of hidden information greater than the value of the information itself this is the authors own characterization of cryptography and while interesting is not how it is used in mainstream securitychapter  starts to get into the internals of federated identities this and the rest of the chapters do not deal with the deep technical details of an ima rather it shows how to design and deploy the ima in a context of a corporate environment under a single set of policies and procedures windley emphasizes that an ima is not so much a technical issue but rather a business issue that must be deployed in a business contextthis idea of a business context is manifest in chapter  which deals with identity policies the book creates what it calls an ima policy stack which is the interoperability framework for the ima the stack includes all of the elements necessary for the ima and comprises an identity management architecture framework and set of standards the standards include all protocols and applications from ssl xml ldap dns and much more the framework includes policy issues such as naming passwords encryption provisioning and more finally the architecture details the specific highlevel controls procurement contracts licensing etc around the imathe book itself is worth it solely for the information in this chapter anyone attempting to deploy an ima without first getting a handle on the issues details in chapter  will find that their ima will likely be seriously deficientthe only negatives to the book are a few too many editing mistakes that should have been caught during the editing process also the author frequently discusses his own trials and tribulations of using an ima during his short stint as cio of the state of utah and with previous employers depending on the readers specific tastes some my find the heavy use of the firstperson anecdotes to be a negativeoverall digital identity provides the reader with a good introduction to the various areas necessary to develop a productive identity management infrastructure anyone planning to deploy an ima or any sort of federated identity solution in a corporate environment will find digital identity a valuable referenceread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusesee all verified
