a car is defined by some basic options like body engine gear box and axles the variants of a model are built by some additional options like color seats wheels mirrors trims entertainment and assistant systems etc options that exclude each other pairwise build an optionfamily that means that you can choose only one option by each family and you have to choose exactly one option this kind of product definition fulfill the requirements of an ideal boolean algebra and can be helpful to construct a product configurator sometimes a set of options car features are combined to an automotive

discusses the principles and benefits of service oriented architecture soa specifically as they relate to the technical challenges in identity and access management and secondarily to help the reader gain an understanding of the commonly encountered issues in identity management  printed pages contents overview introduction anatomy of a digital identity identity and access management framework challenges in identity and access management entitlement management auditing conclusions references overview to date many technical decision makers in large it environments have heard about the principles and benefits of service oriented architecture soa despite this fact very few it organizations are yet able to translate the theoretical underpinnings of soa into practical it actions over the last year a few individual solution architects on my team have attempted to distill the practical essence of soa into the following areas identity and access management service management entity aggregation and process integration these four key technical areas present significant technical challenges to overcome but yet provide the critical it foundations to help businesses realize the benefits of soa note that it is our frequent interactions with architects in the enterprises that enable us to collate synthesize and categorize the practical challenges of soa into these areas our team organizes the strategic architect forums that are held multiple times worldwide annually in these events we conduct small discussion groups to find out the pain points and technical guidance customers are looking for the feedback from our customers has been very consistent issues in managing identities aggregating data managing services and integrating business processes have been cited over and over again as major road blocks to realizing more efficient and agile organizations in addition our team also conducts proofofconcept projects with customers to drill deeper into the real world requirements and implementation issues it is through these combinations of broad and deep engagements with customers that we on the architecture strategy team derived our conclusions on the four significant areas for it to invest in the key focus of this paper is to provide an overview of the technical challenges in one of those areas namely identity and access management and secondarily to help the reader gain an understanding of the commonly encountered issues in this broad subject introduction identity and access management iam is a relatively new term that means different things to different people frequently it professionals have tended to pigeonhole its meaning into certain identity and security related problems that they are currently faced with for example iam has been perceived to be a synonym for single signon password synchronization metadirectory web single signon rolebased entitlements and similar ideas the primary goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a succinct and comprehensive overview of what iam means in order to accomplish this purpose we have structured the information in this paper to help answer the following questions what is a digital identity what does identity and access management mean what are the key technology components of iam how do the components of iam relate to one another what are the key architecture challenges in iam anatomy of a digital identity personal identifications in todays society can take many different forms some examples of these forms are driver licenses travel passports employee cardkeys and club membership cards these forms of identifications typically contain information that is somewhat unique to the holder for example names address and photos as well as information about the authorities that issued the cards for example an insignia of the local department of motor vehicles while the notion of identities in the physical world is fairly well understood the same cannot be said about the definition of digital identities to help lay the groundwork for the rest of the discussions in this paper this section describes one notion of a digital identity as illustrated in figure  our definition of digital identity consists of the following parts identifier   a piece of information that uniquely identifies the subject of this identity within a given context examples of identifiers are email addresses x distinguished names and globally unique identifiers guids credentials   private or public data that could be used to prove authenticity of an identity claim for example alice enters in a password to prove that she is who she says she is this mechanism works because only the authentication system and alice should know what the password for alice is a private key and the associated x public key certificate is another example of credentials core attribute   data that help describe the identity core attributes may be used across a number of business or application contexts for example addresses and phone numbers are common attributes that are used and referenced by different business applications contextspecific attributes   data that help describe the identity but which is only referenced and used within specific context where the identity is used for example within a company the employees preferred health plan information is a context specific attribute that is interesting to the companys health care provider but not necessarily so to the financial services provider figure  anatomy of a digital identity what is identity and access management the burton group defines identity management as follows identity management is the set of business processes and a supporting infrastructure for the creation maintenance and use of digital identities in this paper we define identity and access management iam as follows identity and access management refers to the processes technologies and policies for managing digital identities and controlling how identities can be used to access resources we can make a few important observations from the above definitions iam is about the endtoend life cycle management of digital identities an enterprise class identity management solution should not be made up of isolated silos of security technologies but rather consists of well integrated fabric of technologies that address the spectrum of scenarios in each stage of the identity life cycle we will talk more about these scenarios in a later section of this paper iam is not just about technology but rather is comprised of three indispensable elements policies processes and technologies policies refer to the constraints and standards that needs to be followed in order to comply with regulations and business best practices processes describe the sequences of steps that lead to the completion of business tasks or functions technologies are the automated tools that help accomplish business goals more efficiently and accurately while meeting the constraints and guidelines specified in the policies the relationships between elements of iam can be represented as the triangle illustrated in figure  of significant interest is the fact that there is a feedback loop that links all three elements together the lengths of the edges represent the proportions of the elements relative to one another in a given iam system varying the proportion of one element will ultimately vary the proportion of one or more other elements in order to maintain the shape of a triangle with a sweet spot shown as an intersection in the triangle the triangle analogy is perfect for describing the relationships and interactions of policies processes and technologies in a healthy iam system as well every organization is different and the right mix of technologies policies and processes for one company may not necessarily be the right balance for a different company therefore each organization needs to find its own balance represented by the uniqueness of its triangle an organizations iam system does not remain static over time new technologies will get introduced and adopted new business models and constraints will change the corporate governance and processes to do things as we mentioned before when one of the elements change it is time to find a new balance it is consequently important to understand that iam is a journey not a destination figure  essential elements of an identity and access management system identity and access management framework as implied in the previous sections identity and access management is a very broad topic that covers both technology and nontechnology areas we will focus the rest of this paper around the technology aspects of identity and access management to further contain the technical scope of this topic that is still sufficiently broad it is useful to abide by some structure for our discussions we will use the framework shown in figure  which illustrates several key logical components of iam to lead the discussions on this subject this particular framework highlighted three key buckets of technology components identity life cycle management access management directory services the components in these technology buckets are used to meet a set of recurring requirements in identity management solutions we will describe the roles that these components play in the next few sections directory services as mentioned previously a digital identity consists of a few logical types of data—the identifier credentials and attributes this data needs to be securely stored and organized directory services provide the infrastructure for meeting such needs entitlements and security policies often control the access and use of business applications and computing infrastructure within an organization entitlements are the rights and privileges associated with individuals or groups security policies refer to the standards and constraints under which it computing resources operate a password complexity policy is an example of a security policy another example is the trust configuration of a business application which may describe the trusted third party that the application relies upon to help authenticate and identify application users like digital identities entitlements and security policies need to be stored properly managed and discovered in many cases directory services provide a good foundation for satisfying these requirements access management access management refers to the process of controlling and granting access to satisfy resource requests this process is usually completed through a sequence of authentication authorization and auditing actions authentication is the process by which identity claims are proven authorization is the determination of whether an identity is allowed to perform an action or access a resource auditing is the accounting process for recording security events that have taken place together authentication authorization and auditing are also commonly known as the gold standards of security the reasoning behind this stems from the periodic symbol for gold au the prefix for all three processes there are several technical issues that solutions architects may encounter when designing and integrating authentication authorization and auditing mechanisms into the application architecture single signon trust and federation user entitlements auditing we will describe these challenges and their solutions in more detail later on in this document figure  logical components of iam identity life cycle management the life cycle of a digital identity can be framed in similar stages to the life cycles of living things creation utilization termination every stage in an identitys life cycle has scenarios that are candidates for automated management for example during the creation of a digital identity the identity data needs to be propagated and initialized in identity systems in other scenarios an identitys entitlements might need to be magnified when the user represented by the identity receive a job promotion finally when the digital identity is no longer put to active use its status might need to be changed or the identity might need to be deleted from the data store all events during the life cycle of a digital identity need to be securely efficiently and accurately managed which is exactly what identity life cycle management is about figure  levels of identity life cycle management requirements the requirements for identity life cycle management can be discussed at several levels as represented in figure  the types of data that need to be managed are shown at the identity data level based on our previous definitions of digital identity the relevant data includes credentials such as passwords and certificates and user attributes such as names address and phone numbers in addition to credentials and attributes there are also user entitlements data to manage these entitlements are described in more detail later on but for now entitlements should be considered as the rights and privileges associated with identities moving up a level in the illustration the requirements listed reflect the kinds of operations that can be performed on identity data create read update and delete crud are data operation primitives coined by the database community we reuse these primitives here as they provide a very convenient way for classifying the kinds of identity management operations for example we can classify changes to account status entitlements and credentials under the update data primitive the next level in the illustration shows two identity life cycle administration models selfservice and delegated in traditional it organizations computer administration tasks are performed by a centralized group of systems administrators over time organizations have realized that there may be good economic and business reasons to enable other kinds of administration models as well for example it is often more cost effective and efficient for individuals to be able to update some of their personal attributes such as address and phone number by themselves the selfservice administration model enables such individual empowerment the middle ground between the selfservice and centralized administration models is delegated administration in the delegated model the responsibilities of identity life cycle administration are shared between decentralized groups of administrators the common criteria used to determine the scope of delegation are organization structure and administration roles an example of delegated administration based on organization structure is the hierarchy of enterprise unit and department level administrators in a large organization the above life cycle administration models can be used to support a variety of business scenarios some of which are listed in figure  for instance new employees often require accounts to be created and provisioned for them conversely when an employee is no longer employed the existing account status might need to be changed job change scenarios can also have several impacts on the digital identities for example when bob receives a promotion his title might need to be changed and his entitlements might need to be extended now that we have a better understanding of identity life cycle management requirements we are ready to drill into the challenges involved in meeting those requirements figure  current state of affairs multiple identity systems in the enterprise the illustration in figure  speaks to the fact that a typical user in an enterprise typically has to deal with multiple digital identities which might be stored and managed independently of one another this current state of affairs is due to the ongoing evolution that every business organization goes through events such as mergers and acquisitions can introduce incompatible systems into the existing it infrastructure and evolving business requirements might have been met through third party applications that are not well integrated with existing ones one may presume that it would have been much easier for enterprises to deprecate the current systems and start over however this solution is seldom a viable option we have to recognize that existing identity systems might be around for a long time which leads us to find other solutions for resolving two key issues arising from managing data across disparate identity systems duplication of information identity information is often duplicated in multiple systems for example attributes such as addresses and phone numbers are often stored and managed in more than one system in an environment when identity data is duplicated it can easily get out of sync if updates are performed in one system but not the others lack of integration the complete view of a given users attributes credentials and privileges are often distributed across multiple identity systems for example for a given employee the human resource related information might be contained in an sap hr system the network access account in an active directory and the legacy application privileges stored in a mainframe many identity life cycle management scenarios require identity information to be pulled from and pushed into several different systems we refer to the above issues as the identity aggregation challenge which we will describe in more detail in a later section challenges in identity and access management single signon a typical enterprise user has to login multiple times in order to gain access to the various business applications that they use in their jobs from the users point of view multiple logins and the need to remember multiple passwords are some of the leading causes of bad application experiences from the management point of view forgotten password incidents most definitely increase management costs and when combined with bad user password management habits such as writing passwords down on yellow sticky notes can often lead to increased opportunities for security breaches because of the seemingly intractable problems that multiple identities present the concept of single signon sso the ability to login once and gain access to multiple systems has become the holy grail of identity management projects single signon solutions broadly speaking there are five classes of sso solutions no one type of solution is right for every application scenario the best solution is very much dependent on factors such as where the applications requiring sso are hosted limitations placed by the infrastructure eg firewall restrictions and the ability to modify the applications these are the five categories of sso solutions web sso operating system integrated signon federated signon identity and credential mapping password synchronization web sso solutions are designed to address web application signon requirements in these solutions unauthenticated browser users are redirected to login websites to enter in user identifications and credentials upon successful authentication http cookies are issued and used by web applications to validate authenticated user sessions microsoft passport is an example of web sso solutions operating system integrated signon refers to authentication modules and interfaces built into the operating system the windows security subsystem provides such capability through system modules such as local security authority lsa and security specific providers ssp sspi refers to the programming interfaces into these ssp desktop applications that use the sspi apis for user authentication can then piggyback on windows desktop login to help achieve application sso gssapi on various unix implementations also provide the same application sso functionality federated signon requires the application authentication infrastructures to understand trust relationships and interoperate through standard protocols kerberos and the future active directory federation service are examples of federation technologies federated signon means that the authentication responsibility is delegated to a trusted party application users need not be prompted to signon again as long as the user has been authenticated by a federated ie trusted authentication infrastructure component identity and credential mapping solutions typically use credential caches to keep track of the identities and credentials to use for accessing a corresponding lists of application sites the cache may be updated manually or automatically when the credential for example password changes existing applications may or may not need to be modified to use identitymapping solutions when the application cannot be modified a software agent may be installed to monitor application login events when the agent detects such events it finds the user credential in the cache and automatically inputs the credential into the application login prompt the password synchronization technique is used to synchronize passwords at the application credential databases so that users and applications do not have to manage multiple passwords changes password synchronization as a siloed technology does not really provide single signon but results in some conveniences that applications can take advantage of for example with password synchronization a middle tier application can assume that the password for an application user is the same at the various systems it need access to so that the application does not have to attempt looking up for different passwords to use when accessing resources at those systems entitlement management entitlement management refers to the set of technologies used to grant and revoke access rights and privileges to identities it is closely associated with authorization which is the actual process of enforcing the access rules policies and restrictions that are associated with business functions and data todays enterprise applications frequently use a combination of rolebased authorization and business rulesbased policies to determine what a given identity can or cannot do within a distributed ntiered application access decisions can be made at any layer in the applications architecture for example the presentation tier might only present ui choices that the user is authorized to make at the service layer of the architecture the service might check that the user meets the authorization condition for invoking the service for example only users in the manager role can invoke the loan approval service behind the scenes at the business logic tier there might need to be fine grain business policy decisions such as is this request made during business hours at the data layer the database stored procedure might filter returned data based on the relationship between the service invokers identity and the requested data given the usefulness and often intersecting use of both role and rulebased authorization schemes it is not always clear to application architects how to model an entitlement management framework that integrates both schemes cleanly many enterprises have separate custom engines to do both figure  integrating role and rulebased authorization illustrates a representation of how both schemes might be combined and integrated in this representation we can envision a role definition which typically reflects a job responsibility with two sets of properties one set of properties contain the identities of people or systems that are in the given role for example alice bob and charlie may be assigned to the manager role the second set of properties contains the set of rights that a given role has rights can represent business functions or actions on computing resources for example transfer fund defines a business function and read file refers to an operation on a computing resource furthermore we can assign a set of conditional statements business rules for each right for example the transfer fund right may have a conditional statement to allow the action if the current time is within business hour note that the conditional statement might base its decision on dynamic input data that can only be determined at application runtime it is also important for most organizations to have a consolidated view of all the rights that a given identity possesses to meet this requirement entitlement management applications typically leverage a centralized policy store to help facilitate centralized management and reporting of users rights identity aggregation enterprise it systems evolve organically over the course of an organizations history this is often due to reasons such as mergers and acquisitions or preferences and changes of it leaderships the consequences of this are often manifested through hodgepodges of disconnected it systems with undesirable architectural artifacts identityrelated systems are no exceptions to such it evolutions frequently the enterprise will have not just one identity systems but several each serving different business functions but storing duplicated and related data applications that need to integrate with those business functions are then forced to reconcile the differences and synchronize the duplications for example a banking customer service application might need to obtain customer information from an ibm db database an oracle based authorization database and a homegrown crm in this case the applications concept of customer is defined by three different systems attributes that describe customer such as customer name address and social security number might be stored and duplicated in multiple systems on the other hand nonduplicated data such as the financial products that the customer has purchased and the customers bank balance might be kept in separate systems the application will need to aggregate this data from different systems to get the necessary view of the customer moving the underlying identity data into one huge giant identity system might seem like an obvious answer to this problem however there are many real world issues for example the risk of breaking legacy applications that prevent such solution from being broadly adopted any time soon identity aggregation therefore refers to the set of technologies that help applications aggregate identity information from different identity systems while reducing the complexity of data reconciliation synchronization and integration there are several technical challenges that identity aggregation technologies should help address maintaining relationships for data transformations optimizing data crud operations synchronizing data the next few subsections provide an overview of these design issues a maintaining relationships for data transformations an identity aggregation solution can provide several benefits to applications with disparate views of identity information that manipulate data in different systems the first benefit involves providing applications with a consolidated view or an aggregated view of the data in the individual systems in order to transform and represent data in different views the identity aggregation solution needs to maintain metadata describing the schema representing the consolidated view and its relationship with the data schema in the various identity systems lets look at a specific example of an identity life cycle management application that is managing data across a few existing systems the consolidated view of the management application is represented by a new schema which is made up of new and existing identity attributes figure  reconciling identity schemas figure  illustrates an example where a new identity schema is defined for the application the new schema refers to attributes in two existing identity schemas and also defined new ones that are not currently specified account number cell phone and preferences in order for applications to query and update data in existing stores we will need to maintain data relationships between the attributes defined in the new schema and the corresponding attributes in the existing schemas for example the following relationships will need to be maintained reference   a reference refers to a piece of information that unambiguously identifies an instance of data as represented by a particular data schema for example the customer id attribute allows a data instance as represented by the application scheme in figure  to find its corresponding data instance as represented by existing schema  different schemas may use different references to identify their own data instances ownership   a data attribute may be defined in more than one existing schema using the same example shown in figure  again we can see that the name and address attributes are defined in both existing schemas in the event of a data conflict the application needs to know which version holds the authoritative copy to keep in addition there may be scenarios where an attribute can get its value from a prioritized list of owners in those scenarios when the value for an attribute is not present in the first authoritative source the aggregation service should query the next system in the prioritized list of owners attribute mapping   attributes defined in multiple data store may have the same semantic meaning but have the same or different syntactic representations when querying or updating a data attribute the identity aggregation service needs to know the attributes that are semantically equivalent to one another for example although customer id is defined in all three schemas it is named differently as custid in identity schema  when the application performs an update for an identitys customer id number the system must also know to update the custid attribute for the data instance represented by schema  b optimizing data crud operation as previously identified crud is a database acronym that stands for create read update and delete crud defines the basic primitive operations for manipulating data the reason why crud is raised as a technical challenge is because the performance for completing an aggregationrelated activity that involves crud operations across multiple data backend systems can vary significantly depending on the data relationships in the bestcase scenario crud operations can be parallelized this is mostly true in situations where the data instances can be resolved using the same reference and the data reference always resolves to a unique instance for example if the social security number is the only key used for querying and aggregating data across data stores that particular query can be issued in parallel in the worstcase scenario the crud operations are serialized across data stores serialized operation is common in situations where the references used for resolving data instances have dependencies on other data instances as a simple illustration lets suppose we need to aggregate data from the hr and benefits databases and the instance references are employee id and social security id respectively if the only initial key we have for the query is the employee id and the social security id can only be obtained from the hr database then we will need to serialize the query in the following order query the hr database using the employee id as the key extract the social security number from the above query results query the benefits database aggregate the query results replication is a common technique used to address performance degradation due to crud operations across data stores to address the performance issue a portion of the backend data attributes may be replicated to a store maintained by the identity aggregation service in addition the local copy of the replicated data can be further denormalized to help improve the crud performance c synchronizing data data synchronization is needed in situations when one or both of the following conditions are true duplicate identity attributes exist in multiple backend stores data is replicated to an intermediate identity aggregator store however the use of data synchronization may also introduce other design issues data conflict resolution in situations where the data can be updated from more than one source it is often easy to introduce conflicting data some common practices to help mitigate the situations are as follows assign data ownership priority so that in the event of conflict we will use the assigned authority in a conflict the last writer wins synchronization triggers a couple of common approaches are scheduled updates and event notification based trust and federation as mentioned in the single signon section federation offers a form of single signon solution however federation is more than just single signon federation implies delegation of responsibilities honored through trust relationships between federated parties authentication is just one form of delegated responsibility authorization profile management pseudonym services and billing are other forms of identityrelated functions that may be delegated to trusted parties there are three technology elements that are crucial to the concept of federation a federation protocol that enables parties to communicate a flexible trust infrastructure that supports a variety of trust models an extensible policy management framework that supports differing governance requirements federation protocols are the languages that are used by federating parties to communicate with each other since federation implies that a responsibility is delegated to and performed by a different party the protocol must allow individuals to obtain capabilities—essentially tamperproof claims that a given identity has successfully completed an action or is entitled to a collection of privileges for example in the case of federated signon an authenticated identity obtains a capability that proves that the individual has successfully authenticated with an approved authentication service in a complex business world it is possible to have relatively complex trust schemes involving multiple business parties federation technology must be able to capture the essence of those real world trust relationships into simple to understand but powerful trust models that will help enable various business scenarios some common trust models illustrated in figure  are as follows hubandspoke hierarchical peertopeer web of trust figure  common trust models the hubandspoke model is the simplest to understand in this model there is a central broker that is directly trusted by the federating parties the european union is an example of this federation model where the eu countries directly trust the eu body to provide common economic guidelines and trade opportunities to federated parties in the hierarchical model two parties have an indirect trust relationship if they both have a trust path in their respective branches in the hierarchical tree to a common root authority the american political system demonstrates this trust model this political system has federal state county and local city political bodies each existing at various levels of the hierarchy the peertopeer model represents a collection of adhoc direct trust relationships personal relationships between friends in the physical world are good examples of this trust model note that it is also possible to extend and form new networks of federations that consist of different trust models or hybrid models a basic policy management framework must allow policies to be created deleted modified and discovered in order to promote federated systems that enable new business models and partnerships to be quickly integrated the policy management framework must also be extensible to reflect the dynamicity of the environment it aims to support some examples of application policies that are relevant in the federated world are trusted issuer of identityrelated capabilities the types of capabilities required to invoke an applications operation the kinds of identity information that the application expects in capabilities the kinds of privileges that an identity must demonstrate in order to invoke a service auditing auditing in the context of iam is about keeping records of who did what when within the it infrastructure federal regulations such as the sarbanesoxley act are key drivers of the identityrelated auditing requirements a it audit process the it audit process typically involves the following phases as illustrated in figure  audit generation data collection and storage analysis and feedback figure  it audit process audit trails can be generated by different infrastructure and application components for different purposes for example firewalls and vpn servers can generate events to help detect external intrusions middleware components can generate instrumentation data to help detect performance anomalies and business applications can produce audit data to aid debugging or comply with regulatory audit requirements after the audit data has been produced it needs to be collected and stored there are two main models to consider here distributed and centralized in the distributed model audit data typically remains in the system where the data is generated with the centralized approach data is sent to a central collection and data storage facility once the data is collected they may be processed and analyzed automatically or manually the audit analysis is designed to lead to conclusions on what corrective actions if any are needed to improve the it systems and processes b audit systems design considerations given the typical auditing process described in the previous sections there are several considerations that are important to the design of auditing systems locality of audit generation and storage separation of auditors role flow of audited events once an audit trail is generated the audit data can be stored locally on the same system or transferred to another storage location this consideration is important from a security perspective as audit data can be easier to change and modify if it is stored on the same system that generates it this point can be illustrated by a simple example in the event that a system has been compromised the attacker might be able to modify the audit trail on the local system to cover up the hacking attempt therefore for higher assurance against such attacks you might want the audit system to store the data separately on a remote machine role separation is a common best practice to help minimize the occurrence of illegal activities resulting from actions that might circumvent accountability checks for example a corporate acquisition officer should not be able to approve purchasing requests in the field of it audit it is common practice to separate the system administrator role from the auditors role doing so prevents the system administrator who usually has god status on computers to cover up audit trails of unauthorized activities in a distributed design model where audit data is generated and stored in different systems only allowing data to flow out of the audit generation systems can add another level of safeguard this preventive measure reduces the chances of tampered audit data replacing actual trails in addition identity auditing infrastructures are also expected to be efficient typically means a messagebased asynchronous communication channel available typically means distributed clustered and fault tolerant accurate keep accurate records and traces nonrepudiated can be admitted into the courts of law as evidence typically means the records need to be digitally signed conclusions organizations are made up of people and systems represented within the it systems as digital identities everything that occurs in businesses is the consequence of actions initiated by and for those identities without identities even anonymous identities there would be no activities and businesses would be lifeless constructs at the highest level soa can be seen as a way to organize the business it infrastructure that executes and manages business activities therefore enterprises seeking to realize soa must figure out how to resolve the identity and access management challenges they face today we have provided an overview on a few keys technology areas achieving user and application single signon aggregating transforming synchronizing and provisioning identity data from various identity systems managing access to business functions and data using roles and rules federating with business partners auditing identityrelated activities we also hope that the technical discussions on challenges have helped the readers gain some appreciation of the products and solutions in this space our final conclusion is identity and access management is a cornerstone to realizing soa show me an enterprise that claims to be soaccessful and ill show you an enterprise that has good handle on its identity and access management references  context defines the boundary inside of which an identity is used the boundary could be business or application related for example alice may use a work identity with the identifier alicewallstreetacecom to identify herself at her wall street employer wall street ace as well as to execute a stock trade in nyse her wall street employer and the nyse would be two different business contexts where the same identifier is used soa challenges entity aggregation ramkumar kothandaraman net architecture center may  url

basic issues surrounding identity management the architecture part is very weak what i felt is that the author is confusing delivery management with the technology itself major sections of the book under the guise of governance are devoted to people and expectation management and politics rather than technology majority of what is discussed is applicable universally to execution of any project in any decent sized organization not that this books has nothing to offer on ima itself  but it is too generic and very little on actual technologyread morecomment  people found this helpful was this

the practical sidebycesingeon july  format kindle editioni selected this book based on an upcoming iam project id be involved in and on amazon reader recommendations overly positive as it turns out the book written around  is a bit outdated in some points but this is not too much of an issue given its focus governance broad principles of identity management high level theoretical guidelines of architecture sure it is a good refresh of the high level governance principles that should guide identity management projects from a managerial perspectivebut the book clearly lacks substance when it comes to the practical implementation while it is of some help during the planning phase of im projects it essentially stops where one wants to start conceptual approach theoretical design planning are one thing implementing is another totally absent here the book will not help in areas like dimensioning practical issues and pitfalls product evaluation actual design and architecture roi cost vs benefit and such it is totally lacking any how tothe book starts the traditional way explaining what digital identity is this is followed by about  chapters about the constituents of identity management including authentication trust integrity nonrepudiation and even digital rights management except for a very brief refresher i think these have no place here and they should have been summarized in one single chapter other books treat this much better and many readers will find this part to be a somewhat boring given it is background knowledge for any cissplevel security person the drm chapter chapter  and some other parts in this area are even irrelevant in my viewthis first part is followed by two chapters on  interoperability standards and  federating identity here again the interoperability standards goes into unneeded technical details and misses the point it is not giving the reader an understanding of the real issues interoperability for what purpose what are the issues how can we go about themon the other hand the federating identity chapter should probably be substantially expanded as it is the meat of what identity management is about today three or four chapters should probably be devoted to this and they should include practical examples of scenarios architectures it should be shown why identity federation is key but again the chapter does not go beyond very highlevel and theoretical principlesfinally the book concludes with about eight chapters on architecture governance policies and such while these give an idea of what is required in a well governed enterprise with an advanced maturity model once again these chapters lack real practical usability in addition this part is really not specific to identity management but is rather a short summary of what has to be done in terms of governance enterprise and reference architectures and policy managementhaving read the book im kind of disappointed facing a real project on identity management the reader will surely think good and now what do we do possibly it may make happy the highlevel manager only seeking to understand what identity management is about with no intention to get involved in the projectthis other reader prasad reddy summarizes it very well the book absolutely fails and falls short on explaining the identity management standards and technologies related to single signon federation provisioning and assurance from a realworld idms deployment perspective the book is truly misleading  why so many gave it  or  stars is unclear id hesitate between  and useless no but i will still have to look out for something more useable in real liferead morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsgood introduction to imabyben rothkeon november  format paperbackmany people who review their credit report for the first time are shocked to learn how many identities are linked to them even when there is no problem of identity theft it is not uncommon for people to have  or more names linked to their credit reports due to various errors including permutation of their namejust as it is difficult to maintain and manage identities in the real world it is difficult to maintain and manage digital identities as the digital economy is becoming more ubiquitous the need for a single federated identity is becoming more critical in digital identity phillip windley details the steps needed to develop an identity management architecture imaidentity management has become a pressing need in the past few years this has come about because networks and systems are no longer geared around a single infrastructure and businesses have become increasingly virtual and decentralized in previous years there were simply internal users today systems have internal users along with external users such as consultants contractors thirdparties customers collaborators and many more such requirements necessitate a welldesigned and planned imaso what is this thing called ima windley defines an ima as the coherent enterprisewide set of standards policies certifications and management activities that enable an organization to effectively manage digital identitiesima is also known as federated identity the book notes that the real challenge in developing a federated identity infrastructure is dealing with the various different hardware and software platforms where user accounts reside and working with different organizations and departments including the everincreasing amount of outsourcing when all of that is put together a single federated identity is not easy to come by if there is not an ima in placethe beauty of an ima is that it allows an organization to securely link and exchange identity information across partner supplier and customer organizations while having a single architecture this makes identity management seamlessthe first  chapters of digital identity do a good job of introducing the underlying concepts of an ima including security trust authentication access control and names and directories without an effective security infrastructure in place any ima deployed will not be fully effectiveone oddity though is that in chapter  the author defines cryptography as the science of making the cost of discovery of hidden information greater than the value of the information itself this is the authors own characterization of cryptography and while interesting is not how it is used in mainstream securitychapter  starts to get into the internals of federated identities this and the rest of the chapters do not deal with the deep technical details of an ima rather it shows how to design and deploy the ima in a context of a corporate environment under a single set of policies and procedures windley emphasizes that an ima is not so much a technical issue but rather a business issue that must be deployed in a business contextthis idea of a business context is manifest in chapter  which deals with identity policies the book creates what it calls an ima policy stack which is the interoperability framework for the ima the stack includes all of the elements necessary for the ima and comprises an identity management architecture framework and set of standards the standards include all protocols and applications from ssl xml ldap dns and much more the framework includes policy issues such as naming passwords encryption provisioning and more finally the architecture details the specific highlevel controls procurement contracts licensing etc around the imathe book itself is worth it solely for the information in this chapter anyone attempting to deploy an ima without first getting a handle on the issues details in chapter  will find that their ima will likely be seriously deficientthe only negatives to the book are a few too many editing mistakes that should have been caught during the editing process also the author frequently discusses his own trials and tribulations of using an ima during his short stint as cio of the state of utah and with previous employers depending on the readers specific tastes some my find the heavy use of the firstperson anecdotes to be a negativeoverall digital identity provides the reader with a good introduction to the various areas necessary to develop a productive identity management infrastructure anyone planning to deploy an ima or any sort of federated identity solution in a corporate environment will find digital identity a valuable referenceread morecomment  people found this

brand identity blog home tweet share designing a brand identity by gerren lamson gerren lamson on mar   in business how to tweet this share this one of the most interesting projects that a graphic designer can take on is designing a logo it can be daunting and stressful to come up with logo options based on market research and stumble upon some design magic through the exploratory process narrowing it down to a final approved logo and then seeing it out in the world can be a very rewarding experience for a designer however most of the time a logo is not enough large organizations with layers of management require a thorough brand identity system that provides a unified vision and tools that help everyone build the brand but before we dig in lets define the difference and relationship between a brand an identity and a logo brand vs identity vs logo pin it a brand or branding refers to the perceived image and subsequent emotional response to a company its products and services it also represents the conversation that customers are having with each other about the company and how that spreads my favorite definition about brand is the one seth godin gave a brand is the set of expectations memories stories and relationships that taken together account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another if the consumer whether it’s a business a buyer a voter or a donor doesn’t pay a premium make a selection or spread the word then no brand value exists for that consumeran identity describes the visual devices used to represent the company identity systems are a visual components package that is paired with style guidelines and used as a framework to ensure the corporate image is cohesive and consistent some of the visual devices that leverage the brand elements and style guidelines are as follows stationery marketing collateral packaging signage messaging and digital projects among othersa logo is the central identifiable visual element that helps customers discover share and remember a companys brand usually its in the form of an icon mark or symbol logotype or combination of the two the main purpose of a logo is summed up nicely as the five principles of effective logo design in this smashing magazine article pin it phase  research vision  design brief pin it this phase should be as thorough as needed — depending on the depth of research and size of the company its the most crucial part of the overall process and should result in a design brief that guides the rest of the project below is a list of foundational questions and key dynamics to explore and document through qualitative and quantitative methodologies note this is only a quick overview of the most complex part of this process how is the brand perceived against competitors in the market for products and services youre looking to providewhat is the positioning statement of your brand answer the what how to whom where why and when questionswhat is the heritage of your product type and the origins of its ingredients and fabrication processwho is your audience are they digitally savvy where will your productsservices have contact

the brand was a person what would its personality be how would it look act and talkwhat benefits do you want customers to associate with your brand what is the vision of the brand that you want to createother brand image concerns market awareness emotional associations value to the consumer brand perception vs consumer behavior changes desired in the brandconsumer relationship over time as you can tell its complicated two agencies who i think do a good job with their brand research are landor and fi it shows in the way that they describe their completed work as challengeandsolution projects the design brief its important to have a design or creative brief if the brand identity project is bigger than one designer doing work for a small local business a design brief should contain summaries from the research phase such as target audiences messaging objectives values and mission of the brand and the brands productsservices offering it should also include budget project schedule file formats for delivery and other practical needs if youre looking for tools and help on how to write a design brief for a brand identity project explore the following freelance switch brief tips link list and logo design brief designs just creative and freepdf templates phase  logo identity  guidelines pin it after the research phase is complete and a design brief has been created its time to start designing the logo and identity system the logo there are many ways to start designing a logo but most often times youll see designers begin by sketching out dozens if not hundreds of iterations on paper the process of getting concepts down on paper and then iterating on those ideas can unlock new directions to explore and final solutions that you wouldnt have normally arrived at when starting on the computer after selecting your best sketched concepts you should start iterating on them digitally heres a peak behind the curtain of a few logo concept sketches as they became final digital solutions firefox logo by martijn rijven of bolt graphic art direction by wolff olins pin it itv logo by matt rudd of rudd studio pin it greenpeace airplot logo by airside pin it the identity system the identity system usually starts after the logo is complete the purpose of the identity system is to form a systematic visual language around the logo — one that compliments the design thinking of the logo and offers a family of useful flexible elements that will help to design marketing and business collateral here are some examples fortaleza  by guivillar pin it handsome coffee
