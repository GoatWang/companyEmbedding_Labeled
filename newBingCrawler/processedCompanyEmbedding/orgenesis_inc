good manufacturing practice gmp contract manufacturing services the ctb activity is based on its technology that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and differentiating converting them into pancreatic beta celllike insulin producing cells for patients with type i diabetes the companys subsidiaries include orgenesis ltd and orgenesis maryland incthe company is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing its transdifferentiation technologies for diabetes and vertically integrating manufacturing as well as developing technologies of other cell therapy markets in such areas as cellbased cancer immunotherapies and neurodegenerative diseases the company intends to advance a product that combines cellbased therapy and regenerative medicine autologous insulin producing aip cells into clinical development aip cells utilize the technology of cellular transdifferentiation to transform an autologous adult liver cell into an adult fully functional and physiologically glucoseresponsive pancreaticlike insulin producing cell its treatment for diabetes focuses on patient specific cell therapies pscts using autologous

therapies through our subsidiary orgenesis ltd orgenesis has developed a unique proprietary and patented platform technology called transdifferentiation or cell reprograming whereby an adult cell is converted into another type of cell with its distinct phenotype and function the first indication for the companys unique cellbased therapy was development of autologous insulin producing aip cells that transforms the patients own liver cell into a fully functional and physiologically glucoseresponsive insulinproducing cell designed to provide longterm insulin independence orgenesis has utilized its proprietary technology to successfully reprogram human liver cells into glucoseresponsive fully functional insulin producing cells converting the diabetic patients own tissue into insulinproducing cells has the potential to provide a practical cure for insulin dependent diabetes and overcome the significant issues of donor shortage cost and exposure to chronic immunosuppressive therapy associated with islet cell transplantation because the aip cells are autologous this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy stem cells vs adult cells within the field of cell therapy research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded all living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates differentiates matures and perpetuates in an adult organism throughout its lifetime stem cells in either embryonic or adult forms are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells such as white blood cells nerve cells or heart muscle cells our cell therapy development efforts do not use stem cells but rather offer a much more targeted approach using fully mature adult cells for our purposes in the treatment of diabetes our cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are transdifferentiated to become adult aip cells our technology utilizing adult cells is designed to reduce the risk of cell mutation and allows for the testing of cells ex vivo before insertion secondly our adult cells do not propagate inside the patient eliminating the risk of malignancy lastly our technology utilizes the patients own autologous cells which eliminates the risk of an immune response or rejection and no pouch or encapsulation device is required to isolate the cells from the patients immune system board committees  orgenesis inc orgs privacy policy terms of use disclaimer sitemap

dividing so only two polar bodies are produced in mammals the first part of oogenesis starts in the germinal epithelium which gives rise to the development of ovarian follicles the functional unit of the ovary oogenesis consists of several subprocesses oocytogenesis ootidogenesis and finally maturation to form an ovum oogenesis proper folliculogenesis is a separate subprocess that accompanies and

polar body discarded afterward  ovum it should be noted that oocyte meiosis important to all animal life cycles yet unlike all other instances of animal cell division occurs completely without the aid of spindlecoordinating centrosomes the creation of oogoniaedit the creation of oogonia traditionally doesnt belong to oogenesis proper but instead to the common process of gametogenesis which in the female human begins with the processes of folliculogenesis oocytogenesis and ootidogenesis in the female ovary outer part is called cortex and inner part is called medulla  the cortex consist of many large cells called oogonia  all the oogonia to be used throughout the land fe of a woman are probably produced before the birth which usually dont get mature after ova are produced from oogonia human oogenesisedit oocytogenesisedit oogenesis starts with the process of developing oogonia which occurs via the transformation of primordial follicles into primary oocytes a process called oocytogenesis oocytogenesis is complete either before or shortly after birth number of primary oocytesedit it is commonly believed that when oocytogenesis is complete no additional primary oocytes are created in contrast to the male process of spermatogenesis where gametocytes are continuously created in other words primary oocytes reach their maximum development at  weeks of gestational age when approximately seven million primary oocytes have been created however at birth this number has already been reduced to approximately  million recently however two publications have challenged the belief that a finite number of oocytes are set around the time of birth the renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood has been reported in the postnatal mouse ovary in contrast dna clock measurements do not indicate ongoing oogenesis during human females lifetimes thus further experiments are required to determine the true dynamics of small follicle formation ootidogenesisedit the succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the primary oocyte develops into an ootid this is achieved by the process of meiosis in fact a primary oocyte is by its biological definition a cell whose primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis however although this process begins at prenatal age it stops at prophase i in late fetal life all oocytes still primary oocytes have halted at this stage of development called the dictyate after menarche these cells then continue to develop although only a few do so every menstrual cycle meiosis iedit meiosis i of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development but halts in the diplotene stage of prophase i until puberty the mouse oocyte in the dictyate prolonged diplotene stage actively repairs dna damage whereas dna repair is not detectable in the predictyate leptotene zygotene and pachytene stages of meiosis for those primary oocytes that continue to develop in each menstrual cycle however synapsis occurs and tetrads form enabling chromosomal crossover to occur as a result of meiosis i the primary oocyte has now developed into the secondary oocyte and the first polar body meiosis iiedit immediately after meiosis i the haploid secondary oocyte initiates meiosis ii however this process is also halted at the metaphase ii stage until fertilization if such should ever occur when meiosis ii has completed an ootid and another polar body have now been created folliculogenesisedit main article folliculogenesis synchronously with ootidogenesis the ovarian follicle surrounding the ootid has developed from a primordial follicle to a preovulatory one maturation into ovumedit both polar bodies disintegrate at the end of meiosis ii leaving only the ootid which then eventually undergoes maturation into a mature ovum the function of forming polar bodies is to discard the extra haploid sets of chromosomes that have resulted as a consequence of meiosis in vitro maturationedit main article in vitro maturation in vitro maturation ivm is the technique of letting ovarian follicles mature in vitro it can potentially be performed before an ivf in such cases ovarian hyperstimulation isnt essential rather oocytes can mature outside the body prior to ivf hence no or at least a lower dose of gonadotropins have to be injected in the body however there still isnt enough evidence to prove the effectiveness and security of the technique oogenesis in nonmammalsedit main article evolution of sexual reproduction diagram of oogenesis in a digenean platyhelminthes some algae and the oomycetes produce eggs in oogonia in the brown alga fucus all four egg cells survive oogenesis which is an exception to the rule that generally only one product of female meiosis survives to maturity in plants oogenesis occurs inside the female gametophyte via mitosis in many plants such as bryophytes ferns and gymnosperms egg cells are formed in archegonia in flowering plants the female gametophyte has been reduced to an eightcelled embryo sac within the ovule inside the ovary of the flower oogenesis occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule in ascaris the oocyte does not even begin meiosis until the sperm touches it in contrast to mammals where meiosis is completed in the estrus cycle see alsoedit anisogamy

preclinical cell therapy and regenerative medicine company that is committed to curing type  diabetes in pursuit of this goal the company has developed and patented a novel technology called cellular transdifferentiation that turns an insulindependent patients own liver cells into functional insulin producing cells orgenesis has proven that when exposed exvivo to certain pancreatic transcription factors and in specific sequence human adult liver cells can be transformed into fully functional beta celllike insulin producing cells ipcs after exvivo expansion the ipcs are reinfused via the portal vein of the diabetic patient in preclinical models of type  diabetes nonobese diabetic mice the reintroduced ipcs remain in the liver effectively respond to glucose challenge and successfully maintain glycemic homeostasis in the same nod model the implanted ipcs were not subject to autoimmune attack or cellular ablation orgenesis plans to initiate p trials in the next  months orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue into insulinproducing cells has the potential to overcome the significant issues of donor shortage cost and exposure to chronic immunosuppressive therapy associated with islet cell transplantation for more information visit wwworgenesiscom notice regarding forwardlooking statements this news release contains forwardlooking
