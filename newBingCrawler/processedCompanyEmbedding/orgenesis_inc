proprietary therapies  orgenesis inc orgs privacy policy terms of use disclaimer sitemap proprietary therapies proprietary therapies through our subsidiary orgenesis ltd orgenesis has developed a unique proprietary and patented platform technology called transdifferentiation or cell reprograming whereby an adult cell is converted into another type of cell with its distinct phenotype and function the first indication for the companys unique cellbased therapy was development of autologous insulin producing aip cells that transforms the patients own liver cell into a fully functional and physiologically glucoseresponsive insulinproducing cell designed to provide longterm insulin independence orgenesis has utilized its proprietary technology to successfully reprogram human liver cells into glucoseresponsive fully functional insulin producing cells converting the diabetic patients own tissue into insulinproducing cells has the potential to provide a practical cure for insulin dependent diabetes and overcome the significant issues of donor shortage cost and exposure to chronic immunosuppressive therapy associated with islet cell transplantation because the aip cells are autologous this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy stem cells vs adult cells within the field of cell therapy research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded all living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates differentiates matures and perpetuates in an adult organism throughout its lifetime stem cells in either embryonic or adult forms are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells such as white blood cells nerve cells or heart muscle cells our cell therapy development efforts do not use stem cells but rather offer a much more targeted approach using fully mature adult cells for our purposes in the treatment of diabetes our cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are transdifferentiated to become adult aip cells our technology utilizing adult cells is designed to reduce the risk of cell mutation and allows for the testing of cells ex vivo before insertion secondly our adult cells do not propagate inside the patient eliminating the risk of malignancy lastly our technology utilizes the patients own autologous cells which eliminates the risk of an immune response or rejection and no pouch or encapsulation device is required to isolate the cells from the patients immune system orgenesis inc orgspk company profile  reuterscom x edition united states africa américa latina عربي argentina brasil canada  deutschland españa france

autologous t regulatory somatic cell therapy in development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease as part of the memorandum of understanding masthercell and txcell also agreed to enter into discussions for the longterm clinical and commercial manufacturing by masthercell of txcell productsovasave batches manufactured by masthercell will be used by txcell in its ongoing phase b trial cats for the treatment of crohns disease the first clinical batches could be manufactured by masthercell as soon as q  cats is a multicenter randomized doubleblinded placebocontrolled multidose and multiinjection parallel groups study the trial has been designed to include  severe refractory crohns disease patients it is currently ongoing in  study sites in  countries including austria belgium france germany italy the united kingdom and may be extended into the us the united states food and drug administration recently granted fast track designation to ovasave for the treatment of moderate to severe crohns diseasemasthercell is a european leader in cellular therapy products manufacturing with a significant track record in production of clinical materials this strategic relationship with masthercell is very important to txcell said stéphane boissel chief executive officer of txcellvered caplan chairperson and ceo of orgenesis commented we are pleased that masthercell has entered into a substantial cell manufacturing agreement with txcell for ovasave in an indication that has a clear unmet need which may best be treated through a cutting edge cell therapy like ovasave we look
