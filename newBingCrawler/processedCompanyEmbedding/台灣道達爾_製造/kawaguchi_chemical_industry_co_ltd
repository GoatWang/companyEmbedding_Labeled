production of a carbodiimide and more specifically to a process for the production of a specific carbodiimide background artit is proposed that the concentration of carboxyl groups should be reduced by using a sealant for carboxyl groups since the hydrolysis of a compound having an ester bond such as a polyester is promoted by a polar group such as a carboxyl group patent document  patent document  a carbodiimide compound is used as the sealant for carboxyl groups however as the carbodiimide compound is a linear compound foul odors are produced from a volatile isocyanate compound which is formed as a byproduct when the carbodiimide compound is used thereby worsening the work environment to cope with this the applicant found a cyclic carbodiimide compound as a sealant which does not form an isocyanate compound as a byproduct even when it reacts with a carboxyl group and filed an international patent application for this patent document  a process for the production of cyclic

stoichiometric amount is required a general method used to obtain the carbodiimide c from the thiourea b is an oxidative desulfurization reaction from the thiourea b although a simple method is to use mercury oxide or lead oxide it has a great impact on the environment and cannot be used for industrialscale production a method in which sulfonyl chloride such as tosyl chloride or methanesulfonyl chloride is caused to act in a basic solvent such as pyridine is commonly used and applicable however pyridine is generally expensive and a recovery cycle is required for industrialscale production but its recovery is difficult due to its compatibility with water and its azeotropic phenomenon sulfonyl chloride is also generally expensive to synthesize a carbodiimide from a thiourea a method in which a hypochlorite is caused to act is desired from an industrial point of view however there is no example in which it is applied to the thiourea b the inventors of the present invention conducted

this point the sulfur content was reduced to  ppm and the lc purity was   production of amine represented by formula athe production process of the amine represented by the formula a will be described hereinunder values were obtained by the following methods  identification of compound the identification of each compound was carried out by means of the jnrex nmr of jeol ltd and the gcmsqp mass analyzer of shimadzu corporation yield yield rate the yield and yield rate of the synthesized nitro were calculated based on the compound b lc purity the lc purity indicates the area percent of the compound c based on   of the total area value of peaks excluding the solvent and the raw material compound a by confirming with analysis using highspeed liquid chromatography selectivity the selectivity is represented by area value of tetranitroarea value of tetranitro  area value of trinitromonohalogen x  the area values of the tetranitro and the trinitromonohalogen were obtained by analysis using highspeed liquid chromatography synthesis example step α g of pentaerythritol  g of ochloronitrobenzene  ml of toluene and  g of benzyltriethylammonium chloride were fed to a glass reactor and  g of a   potassium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reactor at  to °c over  hours thereafter a reaction was carried out at the same temperature for  hours after cooling  g of water was added to the reaction product and the resulting product was neutralized with hydrochloric acid thereafter the obtained product was filtered and the filtrate was washed with  g of water and
