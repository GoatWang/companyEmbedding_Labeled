the arc three main types of contract under ccvn see appendix  for the english and vietnamese versions • saesprocurement contract   • contract to manufacture   • contract for services   the model contract is a pure sales contract  an exchange of assets for money in the following parts some principal clauses from the model sales contract are compared with the stipulations regarding civil contracts by the civil code of the socialist republic of vietnam with a view to offering the reader an insight into the subject  matter  structure of the model contract what you should know before reading the contract preamble clause   applicable law clause   definitions clause   entire agreement and contract documents what the buyer will get clause   scope of supply how the goods will be supplied clause   delivery clause  notification of delivery clause  inspection before shipment clause  early delivery partial shipment and delay in delivery what the buyer will give clause  price  how the buyer will pay clause  terms of payment what if the goods are not as ordered  clause  inspection of the goods clause  defects liability liabilities outside the contract clause  liability to third parties clause  taxation the legal status of the contract clause  assignment of rights and delegation of duties clause  coming into force clause  force majeure clause  termination clause  partial invalidity clause  modification clause  language clause  notices clause  settlement of disputes execution appendices  interpretation of the contract under ccvn article  interpretation of civil transactions  the interpretation of a civil transaction must be based upon the actual desire of the parties at the time of establishing such transaction an on the objectives of such transaction  where a civil transaction may be interpreted as having different meanings the civil transaction must be interpreted in accordance with a meaning consistent with the objective of the transaction and  shall be in accordance with the customs of the place where the transaction was established if the party which is economically stronger includes in the civil transaction points which are disadvantageous to the weaker party the interpretation of the civil transaction must be such that favors the weaker party article  interpretation of contracts  if a contract contains unclear provisions the interpretation of such provisions shall not only rely upon the wording of the contract but also shall be based upon the common intentions of the parties  if a clause of the contract susceptible of many meanings the meaning which would allow the implementation of the clause to most benefit of the parties shall be chosen  if a contract contains a wording with many different meanings the contract shall be interpreted according to the meaning which best conforms to the characteristics of the contract  if a contract contains clauses or words which are difficult to understand those shall be explained according to the customs at the appointed place for the execution of the contract  when a contact lacks some provisions not belonging to the essential substance the contract shall be supplemented according to the customs in regard of such types of contracts at the appointed place for the execution of the contract  the clauses of contract shall be interpreted in relations to each other so that each is given the meaning derived from the contract as a whole remark where rules of interpretation allow the court a great deal of freedom the parties should be as precise as possible  applicable law of the contract under ccvn article  civil contracts  forms of civil contracts shall be governed by the law of the country where contract are concluded the contracts that are concluded in a foreign country with violations of law governing forms of contracts shall be valid in vietnam if the form of those contracts does not  violate the law of the socialist republic of vietnam  the rights and obligations of parties in a civil contract shall be determined by the law of the country where performance of the contract takes place the contracts that are concluded and performed wholly in vietnam shall be governed by the law of the socialist republic of vietnam if the place of performance of a contract is not indicated then the place of performance shall be determined by the law of socialist republic of vietnam  the civil contract having immovable property in vietnam as its subjectmatter shall be governed by the law of the socialist republic of vietnam remark article  is in need of clarification by the courts  applicable law of the contract under the model contract  applicable law this contract and all questions relating to its formation validity interpretation or performance shall be governed by the law of note the subclause below is optional this contract shall not include incorporate or be subject to the provisions of the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods remark the model contract assumes freedom of contract in choosing an applicable law it also allows for exclusion of the vienna sales convention  scope of contract technical specifications notes for preparing the technical specification  a set of prcise and clear specifications is a prerequisite for bidders to respond realistically and competitively to the requirements of the purchaser without qualifying their bids in the context of international competitive bidding icb the specifications must be drafted to permit the widest possible competition and at the same time present a clear statement of the required standards of workmanship materials and performance of the goods and services to be procured only if this is done will objectives of economy efficiency and fairness in procurement be realised responsiveness of bids be ensured and the subsequent task of bid evaluation facilitated the specifications should require all goods and materials to be incorporated in the goods be new unused and of the most recent or current models and that they incorporate all recent improvements in design and materials unless provides for otherwise in the contract  care must be taken in drafting specifications to ensure that they are not restrictive in the specification of standards for equipment materials and workmanship recognised international standards should be used as much as possible where other particular standards are used whether national standards of the borrowers country or other standards the specifications should state that equipment materials and workmanship that meet other authoritative standards and that ensure at least a substantially equal quality than the standards mentioned will also be acceptable source world bank standard bidding document procurement of goods p  remark technical specifications must be prepared to allow absolute certainty as to the scope of contract  legal families and the applicable law • the total agreement between the parties is their written contract the fish plus the applicable private law the water • in principle the parties to a contract are free to decide the private law that will supplement their contract ie the parties are free to choose the water their fish swims in each country has its own national law these laws belong to one of three families the civil law family is legal systems based on codified laws the aim is consistency and predictability the judge applies the written law  examples france germany spain the common law family legal systems aimed at achieving the most just result in the individual case there is no written law  only precedents to guide decisionmaking examples england united state malaysia the religious law family legal systems based on moslem principles for contracts these laws tend to adopt international common law or civil law principles examples are saudi arabia pakistan  the vienna sales convention  the united nations conventions on contracts for the international sale of goods the vienna sales convention is the law of any country that adopts it where the convention conflicts with existing national law the convention prevails  the convention applies to international sales only  the parties to a contract can opt out  of the convention with a clause such as this contract and all questions concerning its validity interpretation and performance shall be governed by the law of the republic of verbena this contract shall not include incorporate or be subject to the provision of the united nations convention on contracts for the international sales of goods  many questions about the meaning of the convention must be answered in the courts so far the answers have been slow in coming  even so the importer might wish to accept the convention if the law applicable to the contract is weak or underdeveloped or if it favours the seller too strongly  requirement to provide a users guide article  obligations to provide information and users guide the seller is bound to provide the purchaser with necessary information on the assets sold and guidelines for using those assets if the seller fails to perform this obligation the purchaser shall have the right to request the seller to perform the obligation if the seller still does not perform it the purchaser shall have the right to annul the contract and claim for compensation of damages  remark the buyers right to annulment for failure to produce a users guide would not normally be acceptable to a seller  transfer of risk transfer of title article  moment of transfer of the ownership  the ownership over purchased items shall pass to the purchaser from the moment when the purchaser receives the object except for cases where parties agree or law stipulates otherwise article  moment of passage of risk  the seller party shall bear risks regard of the sold assets until the moment when assets are delivered to the purchaser and the latter shall bear risks from the moment of receiving assets if parties have not agreed otherwise remark the concepts of delivery and receipt will require some definition by the courts under an incoterm contract both terms could mean delivery  transfer of risk and title under the model contract  delivery  date place and terms of delivery the scheduled date of delivery of the goods shall be made risk and title to the goods shall pass from delivery shall be the seller to the buyer on delivery remark transfer of risk and title together is often the simplest arrangement  place of delivery under ccvn and under the model contract article  place of delivery of a sets parties shall agree upon the place of delivery of assets if there are no  agreement on this then the provision of article  residence or headquarters of buyer of this code shall be applied the place of delivery under this contract is   agreed place of delivery note in fob fcr cif and cip etc contracts this is the portplace of shipment remark place of delivery should be stated in cterm contracts it is the port of shipment not the port of arrival  time of delivery under ccvn and under the model contract article  time of performance of a sale contract  the time for performance of a sale contract shall be agreed upon by parties the seller must deliver the assets to the purchaser at the time as agreed the seller can deliver the assets before the fixed time only if the purchaser agrees in cases where parties do not fix the time for delivery of assets the purchaser shall have the right to request the seller to deliver assets and the seller shall have the rights to ask the purchaser to receive assets at any time provided that parties shall inform each other within a reasonable period of time and provided further that parties do not have other agreements  if parties have not agreed upon a term of payment the purchaser shall have to pay upon receipt of the assets  delivery  date place and terms of delivery delivery of the goods shall be made of delivery shall be   the scheduled date remark it is essential to clarify the time of delivery late delivery has important financial consequences the warranty period usually begins to run from delivery   force majeure under ccvn and under the model contract article  civil liability due to breach of civil obligations  the obligor who fails to fulfil improperly the obligation shall bear civil liability to the obligor  the obligor who cannot fulfils the obligation due to force majeure events shall not bear civil liability unless otherwise provided for by agreements or stipulated by the law  force majeure if either party is prevented from or delayed in performing any duty under this contract by an event beyond his reasonable control then this event shall be deemed force majeure and this party shall not considered in default and no remedy be it under this contract or otherwise shall be available to the other party note the subclause below contains examples only it should be modified as necessary force majeure event include but are not limited to war whether war is declared or not riots insurrections acts of sabotage or similar occurrences strikes or other labor unrest newly introduced laws or government regulations delay due to government action or inaction or inaction on the part of any inspection agency fire explosion or other unavoidable accident flood storm earthquake or other abnormal natural event note the subclause below on  non  force majeure events is optional force majeure events do not include if either party is prevented from or delayed in performing any duty under this contract then this party shall immediately notify the other party of the event of the duty affected and of the expected duration of the event if any force majeure event prevents or delays performance of any duty under this contract for more than   days then either party may on due notification to the other party terminate this contract remark forced majeure need details negotiation   penalties and liquidated damages under ccvn article  punitive damages  punitive damages are measure that shall be applied by the agreement or the parties or by law to secure the fulfilment of an obligation by which the defaulting party must pay an amount of money to the injured party  an agreement or punitive damages must be filed in an act which may be separated from including into the main contract article  rate of punitive damages the rate of punitive damages may be a certain sum of money or may be determinated by percentage of the value of the breached part of the obligation but must not exceed  article  relationship between punitive damages and compensatory damages  the parties may agree upon that the defaulting party shall have to pay only punitive damages but not compensatory damages or both either punitive damages and compensatory damages if the rate of compensatory damages was not agreed upon in advance the entire damages must be compensated  if the parties have agreed upon the choice between punitive damages or compensatory damages the right to choose shall be granted to the injured party  in case where punitive damages rather compensatory damages have been agreed upon by the parties or stipulated by law the defaulting party must pay only punitive damages remark the  rate for punitive damages is stringent but it is unclear the possiblity of paying both compensatory and punitive damages is highly unattractive to the seller few contracts will allow it  liquidated damages under the model contract  delay in delivery in the event of late delivery for reason other than force majeures defined in clause  below the seller shall pay as liquidated  damages and not as a penalty the sum of figure and of the value of the undelivered part per day of late delivery up to a maximum of figure and of the price payable clause  below payment of liquidated damages shall be due without the buyer
