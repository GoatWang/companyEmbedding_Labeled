purchasei am writing this review from the perspective of both a lifelong investor and finance instructor at the high school level doug mccormick’s family inc is a fantastic guide for how to manage your family’s finances in order to meet your family’s goals some of the things i truly appreciate about this book include it provides precise financial guidance without being over simplified it has the advantage of providing value to investors of all ages although it is particularly valuable for young people given their investment horizon it provides real actionable advice rather than gimmicks and “get rich quick” schemesi particularly enjoyed the personal insights doug provides of his father who is a former educator because i am a former business executive turned teacher i loved the dialog and contrast between his father’s career and investment advice and doug’s “cash balance” ie no pension retirement needs and approach many families need advice from both perspectives and this dialog provides useful nuance to doug’s advicei am giving this book to new college and high school graduates i know this book and the resources he provides through his website provide the key instructions to lifelong financial success in an approachable and enjoyable fashion i am grateful to doug for a resource that provides those instructions all in one placeread morecomment  people found this helpful

high school dropouts to highly successful business people mccormick explains the fundamentals required to navigate the everincreasing complexity of todays financial world and build a successful family financial future in simple understandable terms he presents a groundbreaking new approach to view manage and mitigate ones financial risks and opportunities which flies in the face of conventional wall street wisdom and advice and provides clear guidance on how to develop execute and achieve ones lifelong financial goalsi worked in finance for  years and was astonished to discover that finance professionals are among the worst managers of their own personal and family financial affairs primarily because they either  did nothing or  followed the conventional wisdom after leaving finance i started my own business and began to utilize some of mccormicks principles but in an unstructured and disorganized fashion  ie mainly by accident it is refreshing to see a new paradigm created which is both simple and makes intuitive sense this is not rocket science nor do you need to be a mathematologist to follow his advice as mccormick says put down the book  just do it you will be glad you
