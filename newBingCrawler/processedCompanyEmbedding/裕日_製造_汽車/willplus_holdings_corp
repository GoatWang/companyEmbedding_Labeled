information ie expiration date etc the phone has lighted indicators informing the user a to swipe the card through the reader b to please wait and c sorry a visual display also shows hello the processor determines if the new card data matches the last card validated by the unit if so the processor permits the user to call from the cellular phone if the card data does not match the cellular phone dials up a registration computer a two way communications link is established such that the registration computer validates the card by checking the computers data base and then sends a validation code to the cellular phone the registration computer after validation or rejection of the card disconnects the cellular telephone link with the phone the cellular phone then permits the user to place as many phone calls as necessary the cellular phone before or after validation permits  calls the phone has an electronic lockout which prohibits calls if a call timer limit is exceeded if the car door is open or after a powerup of the phone unless the card matches the last validated card the phone can be programmed by the registration computer us pat no  to bishop discloses a cellular phone installed in a rental car the cellular phone has a credit card reader  the phone detects an open car door the user selects a rental car and the phone issues visual indicators prompting the customer to insert his or her credit card the phone initially validates the card ie checks the expiration date the phone also issues voice prompts to instruct the user regarding the steps to rent the car the phone communicates with another computer via a cellular network this computer validates the card and determines whether the car selected by the user conforms to a corporate profile stored in the computer for example is the user permitted to rent a luxury car or has his or her company limited rentals to compact cars after validation the computer communicates with the processor in the phone and validates the transaction the user drives the car to a booth at the exit of the lot and receives and signs a car rental agreement this agreement is also electronically stored in the phone objects of the invention it is an object of the present invention to provide a cellular telephone and an associated calling system which verifies credit card information during a first portion of a telephonic communications link and then after such verification completes the call to a designated third party it is a further object of the present invention to provide a calling system whereby the users credit card is billed for such completed calls it is another object of the present invention to provide a cellular phone calling system which verifies credit card data in real time it is a further object of the present invention to provide a calling system which after initial verification of the credit card through a verification computer system does not require additional credit card verification for subsequent telephone calls unless power is withdrawn from the phone unit it is another object of the present invention to provide a calling system whereby once the cellular telephone user logs into the cellular network and his or her credit card is verified third parties may call the user through the cellular network and such calls are billed to the users credit card it is an additional object of the present invention to permit multiple credit card calls as long as the power is supplied to the cellular telephone summary of the invention this is a summarization of the functional specification of the present invention upon entering the rental car the driver turns on the ignition a voice prompt in the processor located in a credit car interface unit between a cellular telephone handset and a corresponding transceiver unitannounces thank you for using alamo rentacar each time the cellular telephone is powered up this procedure occurs the display on the interface is lit by an electroluminescence light including three flashingarrows indicating where the credit card needs to be swiped at this stage the customer can initiate one of four functions represented by buttons on the interface a free callemergency b a free preprogrammed  number customer service call to the rental car agency for assistance c auto redial which enables the user to activate the processor and redial the last destination telephone number until the connection is made eg if a busy signal was encountered d provide instructions by issuing voice prompts to the user these prompts are available in multiple languages to instruct the user regarding placement of a call at any time the customer can swipe a credit card through the card reader in the interface the processor captures and checks the credit card number and expiration date on track two of the card the expiration date is verified by the real time clock coupled to the processor more particularly the processor in the interface conducts a luhn check on the credit card data to determine if the card has been altered or forged further the processor checks the expiration date of the card against a real time clock this feature is important because if the card is not initially validated by the processor the system rejects the card and eliminates the need for further validation of the credit card data at the telecommunications network if the processor determines that the expiration date or the card is not valid it then issues a voice response advising please swipe another card and the three lighted arrows continue to flash if the credit card is accepted by the processor then the three arrows stop flashing and become permanently lit a voice prompt then advises the customer to dial a ten digit destination telephone number area codenumber upon inputting the destination telephone number the processor immediately dials an  number a call placement number to a telecommunications network which includes a local cellular carrier and an ixc most likely through a long distance carrier the telecommunications network includes a local cellular operating carrier providing an initial link between the cellular phone and a telecommunications network a dedicated direct line  phone line sometimes referred to herein as a call placement number and an ixc inter exchange carrier the ixc is a company that receives calls validates a credit card and proceeds to bill the credit card user after the cellular phone is connected to the ixc during a first telecommunications link the ixc in three seconds establishes a separate supplemental data telephone link between the ixc and a credit card validation computer eg a computer system owned by control data corp the validation computer system reviews its data base files to determine if the credit card is good thereafter the validation computer approves or rejects the card if approved the validation computer sends via the supplemental or data telecommunications link an approval code a three digit code authorizing the use of the card the ixc then accepts the code and stores the code in its memory along with the credit card data see the call detail record table in the detailed description the ixc then connects the cellular telephone with the destination telephone this secondary link is a further telecommunications link between the cellular phone the ixc and the destination telephone more particularly upon initially completing the circuit between the cellular phone and the ixc the ixc transmits a dial tone back to the processor the processor then forwards a stream of information to the ixc this information includes the identification serial number of the processor a terminal id number the credit card number and the destination telephone number the ixc places this information into memory and holds this information in the event additional calls are made by the user the processor advises the customer that his credit card has gone out for validation in particular a card accepted or phone used flag is transmitted by the processor before the credit card data if the card accepted flag is high indicating a previous validation by the ixc the processor does not send the credit card data see the call protocol table in the detailed description if the card accepted flag is low the ixc submits the credit card for validation to a validation service normally a computer and waits for the authorization number upon receipt of authorization the ixc processes the designation number and the call is completed the customer can place additional calls by dialing his or her ten digit destination telephone number at which time the processor submits the id of the processor the tid and the destination telephone number to the ixc the ixc has retained the credit card number and the id number of the processor the time necessary to complete the circuit for a postvalidation call is approximately half the original credit card processing time this postvalidation call procedure provides a major cost savings as long as power to the processor has not been interrupted it is not necessary to reswipe a credit card the following is the functional specification of the third party callin system the customer informs the third party that you can reach me by dialing a specified  number and when you hear a tone dial a ten digit number area codetelephone number the third party would dial the  number hear a tone and then dial a ten digit number which would then dial up the processor in the vehicle this occurs at the ixc earlier the customer in the rental car would have swiped his or her credit card and initially placed the aforementioned call to the third party by so doing the user has put in memory at the ixc the processor id number and the credit card number this enables the third party to backtrack to the customer in the rental vehicle to complete the circuit back to the rental car customer the time and charges can be recorded on the users credit card that is being held in memory at the ixc the following is a generalized description of the system the cellular telephone credit card calling system includes at least one a cellular telephone and a telephone network the telephone network which includes a local cellular network one or more long distance carriers various switches and an ixc also

handset and a transceiver unit coupled together by a power and a communications bus a credit card interface unit is coupled to the bus the interface unit has a credit card reader and an electronic system which initially validates the credit card for example by checking the expiration date data magnetically imprinted within the credit card the cellular telephone also includes electronic circuitry which establishes a first telephone communications link with the telephone network and transmits via the transceiver unit in the phone to the network credit card data a cellular telephone id data and the telephone number input into the handset by the user sometimes referred to herein as the input telephone number or the destination telephone number the network has a network transceiver normally at the ixc which receives the credit card data the cellular telephone id data and the input telephone number data upon receipt of at least the credit card data the network transceiver verifies the validity of the users credit card after the credit card has been validated through a verification or validation computer service the network transceiver then completes a further telephonic communications link between the cellular telephone operated by the user and the telephonic device associated with the input telephone number that is the third partys telephone since the network transceiver does not complete the call to the third party prior to validation of the users credit card the system operates in real time further in a preferred embodiment the network transceiver provides some type of indication to the credit interface unit that the credit card has been validated thereafter the user is permitted to make additional cellular telephone calls without requiring further validation of the credit card data by the network transceiver this significantly reduces the time of the cellular telephone call in a working embodiment the credit card data can be validated through the network transceiver in  seconds after the validation at the network level all subsequent calls by the user are completed in approximately  seconds in order to establish this particular credit card cellular calling system the user normally inputs the third party telephone number as a long distance telephone number the credit card interface unit places a call to the network transceiver using a particular predetermined call placement telephone number in one embodiment that predetermined call network telephone number is an  access number brief description of drawings

user will depress the send or s key which is part of function keys  customarily the cellular telephone will then be connected to a local cellular system and ultimately to the destination telephone the telephone will send certain pieces of information to transceiver unit  this information includes a cellular telephone id or identification number as well as the input or destination telephone number data this information is convened to the appropriate radio frequency by transceiver unit  and applied to antenna  antenna  then transmits the radio frequency signals to antenna  which is part of local cellular network or carrier  according to the present invention local cellular carrier  is electronically coupled and is part of the telecommunications network  that includes switch  telephone company lines  and call record system  items  and  are embodied as an ixc in the present embodiment the telecommunications network creates a call detail record for that telephonic communications link which includes credit card data data representing the cellular telephone id number in order to bill the user and may additionally include the destination phone number or the input telephone number ultimately the telecommunications network connects the user through various telephone systems represented in fig  by tel co to a destination telephonic device  where the third party resides hopefully the third party will answer the call and a telephonic communications link will be established between the user at handset  and the third party at destination telephonic device  upon completion of the call represented by a disconnect signal on the line the telecommunications network will complete the call detail record which includes among other things the time day and length of the call the ixc will periodically ie daily rate the call detail records convert the record into telephone call charges and a bill for these charges will be created and processed through the system most importantly in the present invention interface  initially verifies the credit card data then calls a particular ixc within the telecommunications network where the credit card data is further validated through a validation or verification computer system  upon verification which takes about  seconds the telecommunications network ie the ixc then initiates a further telephonic communications link establishing a fully functional communications link between the user at handset  and the third party at destination telephonic device  upon completion of this call the telecommunications network ixc compiles the call detail record rates the call and periodically generates a bill for the call on the credit card for the user for all postvalidation calls by the user the system will not validate the users credit card as long as power is supplied to the phone further details of this system are discussed below with respect to figs a b and c an important feature of the present invention is the userfriendliness

transceiver the network compiles a call detail record as shown in step  in fig a the call detail record as explained in detail later includes the mid tid destination telephone number car rental company and certain other time keeping information such as the time day and length of call upon completion of the telephone call as noted by the hanging up of the user by depressing e the end function  on handset  cellular network  completes the call detail record and rates the call by assigning a monetary value for the call at cellular network step  a bill is produced and in the working embodiment sent directly to the car rental company from the cellular telephone stand point the system returns to visual prompt step  for emergency  calls no bill is generated in addition to the free calls to the rental companies and  emergency calls the user sees display  fig  which reveals a further list of free calls an exemplary free call list table is shown below free call listspeed dial no vendor type sands point food sands point golf sands point tennis joes stone crab food marriott airport lodging display  can be a physical display or an electronic display that can be altered by programming credit card interface  as shown in the free call list above the user is given a speed dial number a vendor and the type of goods or services provided by that vendor preferably up to  free call vendors can be listed in display  the free call list is an advertising device that a advertises goods and services offered by particular vendors b provides additional financial revenue to the car rental company which carries the cellular credit card system c provides crosspromotion of restaurants hotels and tourist attractions and d provides additional financial revenue to the cellular network implementing the credit card calling system for example if the user wanted to play golf he or she would depress the recall function key depress  on telephone input keys  on handset  fig  then depress function key send s in function group  the speed dial numbers for the vendors have been programmed into handset  credit card interface unit  monitors the audio transmission txr line and detects a correspondence between the free call telephone number and the list of free call telephone numbers stored in its memory upon a positive comparison between the free call list and the memory of interface unit  interface unit  then initiates the telephone call in the working embodiment this call uses the call placement telephone number which dials into a particular cellular network this call placement number in the working embodiment is an  long distance access telephone number upon clearance by the cellular network and the formation of a call detail record the network recognizes free calls by a comparison routine the cellular network  then completes the call to the destination in the free call list the cellular network  further compiles a list of an free calls made by the user since each call detail record includes a cellular telephone id tid and then can either bill the vendor on the free call list the car rental company or absorb the expenses for the cellular telephone call as a cost of doing business and obtain advertising revenue from the vendors on the free call list since most rental car customers rent cars in unfamiliar jurisdictions these customers are provided with an easy way to use local goods and services the flexibility provided by the present invention the free call vendor list can be changed electronically by programming interface  via handset  enhances the overall commercial acceptance of the device further car rental companies may offset some of the cost of the credit card calling system by collecting the advertising revenues from the vendors shown on the free call list rather than program the speed dial memory in the handset  such that free call numbers are retrieved therefrom the credit card interface may have its own speed dial memory in this embodiment the user would for example depress a free call activation key on interface  similar to interrupt controls ad depress the speed dial code on handset key pad  depress send function key pad  and the interface unit would then place the call to the vendor over the cellular network in a further embodiment interface unit  could include speed dial function keys assuming that the user has not activated the free call interrupt controls or the free call list the following occurs in the most ordinary case the user would not activate the free call interrupt control or place a call to a vendor on the free call list in such situations the program follows the no branch from decision step  to the swipe credit card step  to visually prompt the user step  continues to flash sequential lights  in an effort to motivate the user to insert his or her credit card into the interface by sliding the magnetic strip of the credit card through reader track  fig  upon inputting the credit card data into interface  step  stores the credit card data in the memory of the interface decision step  is a card digit and count check in other words the interface initially verifies that the correct sequence of credit card data have been input and stored into its memory in addition decision step  determines whether the card data has been received within a certain frequency parameters that is time parameters if not the no branch is taken from step  and in step  the memory is cleared step  is a voice response vs step which informs the user i am sorry unable to read magnetic stripe please swipe again now the local program in the credit card interface unit  then returns to the visual prompt step  if the yes branch is taken from decision step  in decision step  the interface unit  checks the credit card expiration date and data for example a visa card may have a certain data format which differs from mastercard american express etc these formats can be confirmed against a memory check in interface unit  further the magnetic data stored on each credit card includes an expiration date the interface includes a clock and a calendar system such that if the expiration date of the credit card exceeds the current date stored within interface unit  the no branch is taken and memory is cleared in step  again a voice response step  informs the user that the card cannot be used by stating i am sorry please contact card issuer these voice responses are shown in the voice response table above of course additional voice responses could be provided to the user including a response that the credit card has expired and a request that the user insert another credit card into the system from step  the program in the credit card interface  returns to the visual prompt step  in one embodiment the credit card interface processor is designed and engineering to read the entire track ii from visa and mastercard credit cards and pass it in an unaltered state to either the users authorization database or its agent this data track on the card includes the cvc visa and cvv mastercard codes for consumer fraud the expiration date primary account number service code field and pin verification fields the interface processor maintains an internal clock that validates the expiration data information and performs a luhn or number sanity check to insure there are sufficient numbers in the account number field and that the proper algorithm has been employed if it becomes necessary to read and analyze data on track i or both tracks i and ii the processor can be reengineered to comply with the regulations in an ordinary situation the credit card data would be initially validated by the credit card interface unit  this initial validation is a confirmation of the accuracy of receipt of the electronic data from the card a correspondence or data format for a particular card the time frequency for the receipt of the information and the confirmation that the card has not expired voice response step  informs the user to place your call please dial the area code and the seven digit telephone number the user inputs a long distance telephone number even though he or she wishes to make a local phone call the reasons for the input of a long distance phone number is discussed hereinafter decision step  determines whether the telephone number input into the credit card interface  is correctly input by checking the time receipt of that information t and determining whether the user has in fact input the telephone number as a long distance phone call if the no branch is taken from step  voice response step  informs the user that the call cannot be completed as dialed see voice response table items  and  if the yes branch is taken form decision step  decision step  determines whether the input telephone number data corresponds to a lock out telephone code the following lock out call table shows various lock out telephone codes lock out call table  international  international  bill caller  bill caller  bill caller for example the present system does not allow the user to dial an international call or to dial a telephone call which bills the caller the interface unit  can be programmed by activating telephone key pad  in handset  thereby changing the lock out call table to add new lock out call or delete certain lock out call interface  can be programmed by inputting a special key code into the handset the interface monitors the audio txr line and upon receipt of the dtmf signals representing the key code permits the programmer to change the lock out codes free call list call placement number and other critical but variable data in the system the phone controller or interface permits programming regarding the following features restricted phone number such as s  etc can be accepted or rejected by the unit ixc or call placement phone numbers and the order in which the stream of characters are sent out to the telecommunications network particularly the ixc for instance in a second working embodiment the credit card number followed by the destination number is sent out in a single stream of characters this communications protocol is different than the protocol generally described herein in which the stream of characters is partitioned into three segments phone identification number credit card information and destination phone number furthermore in the second embodiment the user is required to slide his or her credit card through the cellular phone card reader prior to every call made these changes were made by modifying the program installed in the credit card interface or phone processor these changes were easily implemented because of the flexibility obtained my making the unit fully programmable if the yes branch is taken from decision step  the user is informed that his or her call cannot be completed in voice response  see voice response table items  and  if the no branch is taken from decision step  the user in step  strikes the send s key in function key pad  of handset  this send key electronic code is placed on the data txr line by handset  alternatively interface  could monitor audio txr and determine by a time out routine that the user wants to place a call after entering the long distance destination number into the handset in this situation it is not necessary to depress the send key as is customary in the industry the input telephone number has been placed on the audio txr line by handset  credit card interface  also provides an echo of the input telephone number which is applied as is customary in the industry on audio receive rcr line in step  the input telephone number data is stored in the memory of credit card interface  the system flow charts shown in figs a b c are linked together by jump point a shown in figs a and b and particularly jump point e shown in figs b and c other jump points return to intermediate steps and are identified in the figures as jump points b c d and f in fig b interface unit  forms a telephone call file in step  the following table shows the telephone call me in a working embodiment telephone call file  ld access att mci cellular world mid merchant id tid terminal id destination tel  cr cd data card accepted flag yesno in the working embodiment the telephone call file uses a predetermined call placement number which is an  long distance access number through a cellular telephone network to an ixc in a telecommunications network which is identified in the industry as cellular world since certain components of the cellular telephone credit card system include processing data at the telecommunications network particularly the billing of the users credit card in the working embodiment all calls in the system are placed to one predetermined call placement telephone number however if several cellular networks participated in the system different call placement numbers would be used as discussed later all calls placed to a designated telephone by the user are in fact placed with the call placement telephone number unique to a certain ixc in a telecommunications network the telephone call file formed by interface  also includes cellular telephone id data which is similar to or equivalent to the terminal id tid customarily associated with credit card purchases in the consumer transaction industry the merchant id mid may designate the car rental company or other entities which will be compensated by the bank for the credit card call the cellular telephone id number is similar or identical to the terminal id number tid in the credit card transaction industry the tid is normally associated with a particular terminal which verifies credit card data in the working embodiment the ixc electronically submits the credit card transaction data with the tid mid credit card number and validation approval code to the users bank or credit card issuer the credit card issuer pays the network which in turn pays various entities such as the car rental company the local cellular phone network etc since the call placement number is an  long distance access number the calling system works throughout the us since long distance access procedures normally require the user to input an area code to call a particular destination the present system utilizes these features and requires the user to dial an area code even though he or she wants to make a local call the destination telephone number is the equivalent of the input telephone number data input by the user using the telephone key pad  in handset  of fig  the credit card data stored in the telephone call file represents the data obtained from the credit card by the credit card reader and interface  the credit card accepted flag is a positive or negative statement yesno which indicates whether the credit card has been validated through the validation system described hereinafter and associated with the telecommunications network initially the credit card accepted flag is set to no as part of the initialization step  in fig a step  closes certain audio and digital communications paths between handset  and transceiver  step  transmits the call file from interface  via transceiver  to telecommunications network as is customary in the industry the transmission of information is echoed by transceiver  back to display  in handset  the audio rcr and data rcr signal paths are closed to produce this echo accordingly the user is informed that a the cellular phone has dialed the particular call placement telephone number unique to a certain ixc in a telecommunications network b the mid and tid have been sent and c the credit card data has been sent to the network decision step  determines whether the first telephonic communications link has been established between the cellular telephone consisting of handset  transceiver  interface  and the ixc in telecommunications network if the no branch is taken from decision step  voice response step  indicates to the user that he or she must try the call later the local program in the interface unit then jumps via jump step b to the voice response step  which again informs the user to place the call through the system using a long distance phone number the destination telephone number is removed from the call file memory if the yes branch is taken from decision step  voice response step  informs the user that hisher credit card information is being verified by the network as stated earlier the parallelogram about step  indicates that the ixc in telecommunications network executes the step at that network certain information is stored for processing network decision step  determines whether the card accepted flag is set yes or no network decision steps are shown as having a double line on the right side of the decision diamond local decisions made by the cellular phone are shown as single line diamonds in the working embodiment a certain communications protocol has been established between the cellular telephone and the cellular network the call protocol table shows that communications protocol call protocol table  dial predetermined cell net number  handshake acknowledge no ack retry  send cell phone id tid  handshake  send cr cd data and card accept flag  handshake ack only if card validated or if flag yes  send destin tel   handshake  establish comm link with destin tel as is shown in the above table the cellular telephone calls the telecommunications network using the determined call placement telephone number the network provides a handshake which is basically an acknowledgment ack that the first telecommunications link has been established between the network and the cellular telephone if the network has not accepted the placement number the network sends a no acknowledgment signal and the cellular phone retransmits the information at least once in step  of the protocol the cellular telephone sends the cellular telephone id to the cellular network this id at least includes the tid and may further include the mid the network then provides a handshake an acknowledgment or a no acknowledgement and then if acknowledged the phone sends the credit card data and the card accept flag the card accept flag as stated above is either yes that the card has been previously accepted or no the card has not been previously accepted the card accepted flag is sometimes referred to herein as the phone used flag the network then acknowledges receipt of that data if the card accept flag is set to yes if the card accept flag is set to no the ixc in the telecommunications  network before sending the acknowledgment step  calls a validation vendor system in step  the no branch is taken from network decision step  after calling the validation vendor step  which is normally a computerized credit card validation service network decision step  determines whether the credit card has been accepted by the validation vendors computer in other words in the credit card transaction industry there are completely computerized credit card validation services that validate credit cards in real time the telecommunications network described herein electronically calls one of those credit card validation services and obtains verification of the validity of the credit card before completing the second portion of the telephonic communications link to the third party this is a supplemental data telecommunications link fig  shows a brief flow chart of this type of validation in step  the basic credit card data is checked by the validation computer system for example is the credit card a valid visa credit card with the correct numbers has the credit card been reported stolen step  determines the velocity of use the number of times per predetermined period that the credit card user has used the credit card eg more than  times per day whether the credit card use falls within certain parameters and exceeds certain thresholds for example a validation service may determine that once credit has exceed a  spending parameter through multiple transactions over a one day period the credit card user will be called by the credit card company in step  the credit card validation service either accepts or rejects the credit card in step  that acceptance or rejection data is sent back to the ixc in telecommunications network fig  this may be an approval code the interface processor is configured to interface with specific authorization and validation vendors to receive an ok to use approval code prior to completing the first call between the user and the destination phone initially the credit card will be employed as the payment option which requires an authorization vendor ultimately ceridan telemoney to provide the proper fraud control mechanisms for the system and to insure that a timely response to the ixcs validation request is received by the processor in the form of an acknowledgment as the calling system expands other third party validation communication networks will be employed to secure the proper validation to approve the credit card track environments for other payment options network decision step  upon receiving the rejection code from the credit card validation company follows the no branch and enters network step  a reject code is noted and this data is linked with the credit card data in call detail record file formed at the network the network then refuses to send the acknowledgment to the cellular phone noted as step  in the call protocol table and after a certain time out period for example  seconds interface unit  disconnects the first telephonic communications link between it and the network in local step  thereafter interface unit  executes voice response step  which informs the user that he or she must contact the credit card issuer as part of the initial validation at interface unit  the interface unit may also execute decision step  which determines whether the credit card number input by the user has been twice rejected by the ixc in telecommunications network if it has the yes branch is taken and the system powers down in step  steps  and  are optional if the no branch is taken the local program in interface unit  passes to jump point d which precedes voice response step  the initial voice response step in fig a again assuming that the credit card has been accepted by the validation service and by the network network decision step  the yes branch is taken and the network executes step  wherein the network forms a partial call detail record returning to network decision step  if the card accepted flag code is yes or high from the phone the yes branch from that decision step also leads to network step forming the partial call detail record file the call detail record table which follows shows the information present in the call detail record call detail record table mid tid destin tel  cr cd data authorization code time day length cost in interface  local decision step  determines whether an excessive amount of time has passed a time out function since the cellular phone sent the credit card data step  in the call protocol table to the network if so the yes branch is taken and voice response step  informs the user that the system is experiencing difficulties and requests the user to try the call later the local program in interface  then jumps to jump point c in fig a which precedes local decision step  if the time has not run out in local decision step  the ixc in telecommunications network in network step  completes the first portion of the call sends an acknowledgment or handshake step call protocol table and obtains the destination telephone number the input telephone number data from credit card interface unit  via transceiver  step call protocol table since the credit card has been invalidated in accordance with standard credit card validation procedures through a validation computer system the call detail record is updated to log in the authorization code obtained from the validation system in addition the time and day of the call is noted in the call detail record as well as the start time of the call at the local level in interface unit  step  sets the card accepted flag to yes this occurs based upon the acknowledgment from the network in step  in the call protocol table in other words the ixc in the telecommunications network would not acknowledge the credit card and request the sending of the destination telephone number unless the credit card has been independently validated through the validation computer system after local step  the flow chart goes to jump step e in fig c local step  monitors data txr line and the user such that when the user presses the end e function key function key pad  on handset  interface  notes the end of the call an electronic signal is placed on data txr commensurate with the end call signal made by the users depression of key e network step  then disconnects the telephone call optionally the ixc in the telecommunications network senses a disconnect tone on the line thereafter the ixc will send a disconnect signal to the interface the interface  will decode the signal and disconnect the cellular link with cellular network  without depression of the end key this reduces cellular network time in network step  the telecommunications network completes the call detail record the call detail record includes the total length of the call the ixc in the network rates this call and includes a dollar amount to be charged to the users credit card after network step  the system flow chart separates such that the path below circle  occurs at the cellular network whereas the path below circle  occurs at the local cellular telephone at the network circle  the call is rated in step  this rating can occur in the call record system  shown in fig  in fig  the communication between the telecommunications network and the credit card validation system  is shown by double lines extending from switch  to validation system  network step  sends this credit card charge to a credit card clearance center these clearance centers shown by double lines leading to billing system  in fig  are well known in the credit card transaction industry and are available to electronically process this financial information for many types of credit card vendors the electronic sending of the credit charge information to the clearance center is represented in fig  by the double line extending between call record system  and billing system  returning to fig c network step  clears the credit card charges and settles those charges by billing the users credit card and transmitting funds to the appropriate entity particularly after the call is completed the ixc in the telecommunications network tabulates or rates the call if additional calls are made by the user these call are fed through the ixc logged with the users credit card and rated at the end of the day the ixc batches the call record data for all users and submits the data to mastercard visa american express etc for payment at that time payment is made by the credit card companies to the operator of the system ie the company who leases the ixc the  call placement number and contracts with the car rental company to install the cellular phones made in accordance with the principles of the present invention at the end of each month the operator of the system receives bills from the local cellular carrier for all air time used in conjunction with certain cellular phone ids tids from the lessor of the  call placement number from the ixc for data management services and from the validation company the latter bill is based upon the dollar amount validated by the service the operator of the system then pays these bills returning to the local cellular telephone circle  at local decision step  a determination is made whether the power is still being supplied to the cellular telephone if the no branch is taken step  clears the telephone call file and step  is the end of the local program if the yes branch is taken step  monitors the audio txr line from handset  to interface  if the user waists to place another call from telephone key pad  the dtmf signals will appear on the audio txr line in step  interface unit  determines whether the input telephone number data conforms to frequency and format long distance format and whether the number is a locked out telephone number in step  the newly input telephone number is stored in memory and in step  a new telephone call file is formed of course since the credit card data has already been initially locally validated by interface  and then subsequently validated prior to completion of the first call by the telecommunications network the telephone call file stored in interface  has the card accepted flag set to yes since the card accepted flag is set to yes actual validation of the credit card by the telecommunications network is not necessary accordingly the local program in interface  jumps via jump point f to fig b the transmit call file with timing and echo step  to summarize these major features the interface unit initially places a call to a specific ixc in a telecommunications network at the telecommunications network a protocol has been established such that the cellular telephone will send the network transceiver the cellular telephone id number tid and credit card data thereafter the telecommunications network then calls a credit card validation service to determine in real time whether the credit card data is valid and acceptable once the credit card data has been validated by the validation and verification service computer the telecommunications network then obtains the input telephone number from the cellular phone and establishes a further telephonic communications link between the cellular telephone and the telephonic device corresponding to the input telephone number this is very different from other prior art cellular telephone credit card calling systems in the prior art systems the communications link between the telecommunications network computer or switch and the user of the cellular telephone is disrupted or broken after the initial verification of the credit card thereafter the cellular telephone user must make a second independent telephonic communications link with the destination telephone device fig  diagrammatically illustrates the major system components of credit card interface unit  the credit card interface unit  includes pin connectors  and  respectively coupled to handset  and transceiver  jumper  indicates that the  lines or wires w fig  are directly connected to handset  and transceiver  please refer to the pass through table set forth above the audio txrin signals are fed to a dtmf transceiver the dtmf transceiver initially decodes the dtmf signals into digitally formatted signals and applies the same to bus  dtmf transceiver  also is capable of converting or encoding digital signals obtained from bus  into dtmf outputs which are applied to amplifiers a and a amps  and  these amplified signals particularly the amplified signals from amplifiers  are fed to the audio rcr line of the handset via pin connector  as an echo and applied to audio txr line the audio txrout and pin connector  leading to transceiver  the audio rcr is an echo function since the audio txrout is fed directly to the transceiver the dtmf transceiver is sold under model t the digitally formatted signals from dtmf transceiver  are processed by processor or cpu  which controls read only memory  random access memory  dtmf transceiver  inputoutput latch or buffer device  gal programmable logic device  and inputoutput latch  the cpu is a microcontroller manufactured by toshiba as tmpca a zilog microprocessor can also be used particularly model c bus  is a  bit bus operating at a speed of  mhz ram  in the working embodiment is a k byte ram and rom  is a k eprom gal  is a programmable logic device manufactured by national semiconductor particularly a gal v is used this programmable logic device or gal has  inputs and  outputs the gal blocks certain signals and enables memory coding and decoding and further enhances the processing of signals and data thereby reducing the need for extensive processing by cpu  rom  stores the initialization program for the system a power fail detect circuit  is coupled to ram  as is a small back up battery  in the event power to the cellular phone is lost power detect circuit  is activated which provides enough voltage to ram  to store critical data the storage of data is used to enable a programmer to change the pass word or the defaults such as removing the electronic locks for transmitting certain telephone numbers please refer to the lock call table above inputoutput latch  is sold as a hc bidirectional buffer as such it handles the input and output of data in two directions io latch  is coupled to the key pad  user actuation keys ad and the credit card reader  returning to gal  the gal acts as a converter to sense the send key electronic signal and end key electronic signal on the data txr line gal  also generates those signals and applies the same to transceiver at certain occurrences as described above for example when the call placement telephone number is sent via dtmf transceiver  to transceiver  gal  sends the electronic code representative of the send function key to transceiver  accordingly transceiver  believes that it is communicating directly with handset  rather than interface unit  a second inputoutput latch  is coupled to internal bus  inputoutput latch  is sold as model hc an acts as a latch to control lights  and an inputoutput device for clock  lights  are supplied by a high voltage transformer  which converts the  volt power signal from power line  into a  volt peak to peak high voltage signal to drive lights  since lights  flash in a sequential manner to prompt the user to slide his credit card through reader  io latch  in conjunction with cpu  and rom controls the sequential driving of those lights in order to produce the voice prompts credit card interface  includes a voice processor  in the working embodiment voice processor  is a toshiba voice recording unit tcf which permits voice recording and play back using adaptive voice modulation voice processor  is a processor which encodes decodes and enables voice recording into memory  memory  is sufficient to record m bits which is equivalent to approximately eight minutes of speech in the working embodiment memory  is a read only memory but may be configured as a random access memory gal  is used for memory encoding and decoding and to provide additional addressing of the memory gal  enables decoding of certain address lines and interleaving of data into the cpu cycle in the working embodiment the voice processing and synthesis circuit including processor  gal  and memory  is placed on a separate circuit board as compared with the other components as shown in fig  of course the components shown in fig  must be supplied power which is obtained from an appropriate transformer not shown in the drawings but known to persons in the ordinary skill of the art the transformer is coupled to power line  because of the flexibility of the system the present cellular telephone calling system also enables third parties to call the user after the user has logged into the cellular network although this seems to be quite simple in fact the users credit card are billed for this third party call this is dissimilar to other calling card systems the third party call table shown below exemplifies this feature third party call table  user calls third party after credit card validation and provides third party with cellular telephone number and special network number   disconnect  third party calls network number  voice or tone prompts third party to input users cellular phone number  call detail record file formed at network  file linked to users credit card number  network completes telephone communications link with user and third party  disconnect  network completes call detail record file time and billing  users credit card billed once the user has called into the cellular network and his credit card has been validated by the network the user must call the third party and provide the third party with a certain call placement number for the cellular network having the uniquely configured network transceiver as well as the user telephone number thereafter the user and the third party disconnect that telephonic communications link the third party then calls a predetermined third party call placement number for the network a voice prompts the third party to input the users cellular telephone number the third party uses a touchtone type phone to generate the correct dtmf signals which represent the users phone number since the users cellular telephone number has been previously linked to a credit card and that credit card has been validated by the system a call detail record is formed in the cellular telephone network which provides a correspondence between the incoming third party call and the users credit card that call detail record is generally similar to the call detail record table set forth above the call detail record notes the time and day and length of that third party call after the detail record is formed the cellular network then calls the users cellular telephone after the call between the user and the third party is over the network completes the call detail record this entails determining the total length of this third party telephone call and rating the call thereafter the cellular telephone network bills the users credit card outgoing protocol and events description after a credit card has been swiped through the credit card reader the interface controller validates the card by taking two actions first a luhns modulus calculation is performed to verify the integrity of the card number read by the system secondly the expiration date is checked against the content of the internal real time clock if any of these tests fail a voice message is issued to inform the user of the abnormal condition if the aforementioned tests are successful the controller will compare the number just read against the credit card number stored in its internal memory if the numbers are found to be different the content of the internal database will be replaced will be replaced with the new number and a phone used flag will be cleared to indicate that the credit card just read has not been used on the other hand if both the new number and the previously stored numbers are found to be the same no further verifying actions are taken in either case the controller waits until a valid phone number is entered via the handset when an allowable phone is entered the following events will take place cellular phone central switchstep the controller takes

destinationis an indication that the credit card has number againalready been used by the cellular in very rare occasions the centralphoneand the credit card information switch may deem necessary to requestdescribed in this section should not be all the information again perhapssent to the central switch therefore the because it cannot find a credit cardcontroller will proceed to the step number associated with the phone idnumber  in such a case a request all information tone will be sent out to the controller to request the full information from the controller unitstep if a request all informationis received the controller will clear thephone used flag and repeat allsteps   and if a nak tone is received two distinctevents may occurfirst if a predefined maximumnumber of retries has not beenexceeded step  will be repeatedsecond if the maximum numberof retries has been exceeded thecontroller will terminate the phonecall and a voice message will beplayed to inform the user about theabnormal conditionif an ack is received the controllerwill connect the phone call to continueuntil the call is terminated or until theend key is pressed on the handsetunit third party protocol and events description the system supports two modes of operation in the first mode phone calls are originated by the user to the location where the cellular worlds phone controller the ixc is located the user may be in a rental car limousine and the like the second mode of operation arises when the party originating the call is not the one that physically possesses the phone controller ie not the user but is a third party at a remote location the third party may originate a call from an ordinary touchtone telephone for this mode of operation to work it is indispensable that the users phone controller the device to which the phone call is being made already contains validated credit card information a postvalidation call and that this information has been conveyed to the central switch computer ixc by means of a phone call the first phone call in other words the user must make at least one phone call so that the ixc can register the phone controller identification number id and the credit card number linked to it as an illustration of the second mode of operation assume that the user and the phone controller unit is located in a rental car and the phone number for this device is aaabbbb the user rents this car then swipes a valid credit card through the card reader device and places a phone call to another telephone number cccdddd when the phone call is established the ixc computer saves in its database the id of the originating device along with the number of the credit card used to perform this transaction in this hypothetical scenario the user informs the person at the remote location that in order to contact him or her the following procedure must take place  the third party will dial a xxxyyyy number of the ixc  when the ixc answers either through a n human or a machine the third party will then inform the ixc of the users phone number eg aaabbbb  the computer at the ixc location will then verify that the desired phone number is linked to a valid credit card when the information is verified the ixc computer will proceed to call the desired location that is the aaabbbb destination number in contrast if the information cannot be verified the third party caller is informed that the desired number is not active and the call should be tried again with a different number  when the cellular phone rings the controller will take the phone offhook and transmit an answer tone to the ixc computer for a predefined period of time such as two seconds  upon detection of this answer tone the ixc computer will send an identification code to the cellular phone controller the controller then checks this id code against its own internal id if both codes match the controller will allow the phone call to be completed otherwise the controller will hangup the cellular phone  if the phone call is successfully established between the user and the third party the ixc will record the duration of the call for billing purposes when the phone call is terminated the ixc will call a credit card authorization agency visa mastercard etc and obtain an authorization number to charge the phone transaction on the opposite side if the phone call failed the ixc will inform the originating device of this irregularity as can be seen the second mode of operation allows a third party at a remote location to contact a users cellular phone through the credit card calling system described herein the credit card interface and controller can be integrated into a unitary cellular phone that is as part of the circuitry that detects keys pressed on the keypad sends and receives dtmf tones in the circuit sends information to the display and communicates with the transceiver circuitry similar to the standalone interface unit  in fig  the central processing unit cpu in fig  is responsible for reading and managing data received from the credit card reader and communicating with the telecommunications network transceiver particularly the inter exchange processor ixc in order to validate and allow the full telephone link to be established fig  diagrammatically illustrates a unitary or one piece cellular phone with a builtin credit card reader  user keypad  enabling the user to input destination phone numbers and send end and other function commands commonly found on cellular phone handsets display  microphone  and speaker  the microphone and speaker signals are amplified and conditioned to the appropriate level and state by amplifiers   the unitary phone includes a transceiver  having receive unit rx  and transmit unit tx  these units are coupled to a duplexer  such that the signals are sent to and received from antenna  the central processing unit or cpu  is coupled to an internal signal and communications bus  and to rom  ram  and various inputoutput modules io   and  additionally the cpu communicates with transceiver  thereby sending dtmf signals over the cellular phone carrier to the ixc in the telecommunications network to validate the users credit card data transceiver  may further include signal buffers or conditioners the claims appended hereto are meant to cover modifications and changes within the scope and spirit
