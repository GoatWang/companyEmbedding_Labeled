engineering strategy office technology center proposing diverse business plans based on advanced ict with ucwinroad utilized for planning prototyping process and proposals in relation to automobiles  user information hagiwara electric co ltd url  httpwwwhagiwaracojp location  higashiku nagoya city services  sale of integrated circuits semiconductors and general electronic components sale of electronic equipment and manufacture and sale of fa equipment headquarters annex hagiwara electric co ltd we are exploring what kind of things we can do to give rise to new business using technology of hagiwara electric and carrying out many different activities using leadingedge technologies of not only ours but also other companies towards the starting up of new business as a technology trading company from this point of view they currently focus on advanced technologies that are not established yet but likely to grow up in the future including automatic driving or wearable devices such as smart glasses they are aiming to commercialize this says mr takaharu sedo assistant manager engineering strategy office technology center hagiwara electric co ltd about the role of the section he belongs to our user to feature in this issue is hagiwara electric co ltd which develops and provides a variety of solutions using a wide range of information and communication technologies ict including electronic devices special focus is put on engineering strategy office technology center in charge of building new technological strategies and planning and development of new business based on them about  years ago when the company was working on evaluation of dangerous scenes for development of the advanced driving support system adas they came across an idea of applying virtual reality vr to the case on which there are some restrictions in using an actual car this led to introduction of ucwinroad a threedimensional d realtime vr product of forumrealizing a possibility that d vr could be utilized they have been effectively using ucwinroad in developing diverse technologies related to automobiles evaluation towards commercialization and proposals etc mr takaharu sedo assistant manager engineering strategy office technology center  providing a variety of solutions by making most of its advantages as a technology trading company hagiwara electric co ltd was founded in  as hagiwara denki kogyo for manufacturing and repairing radio sets along with its business expansion it became a jointstock company and changed its name to the current one in today having its headquarters and headquarters annex located in higashiku nagoya city it has domestic offices including miyoshi office nisshin office tokyo branch toyota logistic center and kyushu substation its foreign subsidiaries are located in singapore india usa china korea germany and thailand nearly  employees are positioned over them the company is organized with three business operations as its core electron device it solution and development and production electron device business unit and it solution business unit develop products for clients and solve problems at production sites while development and production unit develop and manufacture electronic and information products that are needed there beyond these domains technology center gathers about  engineers from three business units based on the technologies information and experiences accumulated through individual business domains the center is organized to plan technological strategy towards the future develop elemental technologies and plan and create new business calling itself a technology trading company the company has advantages in electronic devices moduleunit information platform and elemental technologies such as image technologies it provides diverse solutions through application technology development prototyping and odm development etc in the fields like work support systems automatic vehiclecontrol systems sensor network systems nextgeneration hmi security systems logistics and fa systems   advanced technologies and approaches to creating business with utilization of them the technologies i am focusing on now is iot internet of things and mm machine to machinei think that various products will get connected to the internet more and more from now on communication between machines will probably allow many different data and information to be absorbed automatically in the future world responding to such tendencies the company has explored for example what they can do by mm in the automobile industry which is their main client as part of this preparations for realizing the vehicle management system is in progress this system obtains big data in real time by transmitting diverse vehicle information by way of the obd ii terminal mr sedo explains that they aim at leading to new business by utilizing this on the other hand one of the main tasks he is currently dealing with is development of a telematics system for confirming information on managed vehicles in real time for lev light electric vehicles which will probably be widespread in the aging society in the future they are developing a vehicle management system capable of monitoring where the target vehicle is traveling and whether or not there is anything unusual etc another one is commercialization of smartglasses a kind of wearable device which unite a camera and a display with glasses they paid attention to their characteristics that allow the user to conduct various operations handsfree and are willing to demonstrate the effects in work support such as in assembly in the factory maintenance at the remote place and in logistics etc   introducing ucwinroad for developing simulators for adas technology verification of automatic driving technology assuming practical operation of the unattended taxi recently adas advanced driving assistant system has been becoming widespread rapidly this is a system that supports safe driving through the automatic brake support for keeping ones lane and warning to drivers etc based on the information obtained by the radar camera or sensor equipped in the vehicle about three years ago the company was working for development of adas technologies trying to obtain sample data for image recognition about the situation of automatically applying brakes in danger of hitting the car ahead we had already obtained the data on the points of recognizing cars coming close or going away had using actual cars however we wanted to step forward and obtain data for image recognition of real dangerous scenes” this requires highly accurate data while it is very dangerous and impossible to redo thus they wondered if they could represent different scenes with vr for evaluation comparing tools provided by some companies they came to adopt ucwinroad in consideration of its advantages in a comprehensive manner for example it allows the user to create vr easily with simple operation with a reasonable price and offers support to details in japan as mr sedo remembers forum also cooperated with us in many ways at that time saying that our intention of using it as an image tool for evaluating collision prevention or as a camera for simulation of experiences was interesting which was totally different from the framework of the driving simulator treated so far the vr simulator developed using ucwinroad like this has been utilized for evaluating image recognition of dangerous scenes and obtaining simulated can controller area network information etc in the field of invehicle adas he says that introduction of vr simulators also brought about other advantages like decrease in misdetection owing to the improvement in evaluation accuracy   utilization of ucwinroad in diverse ways with its characteristics driving support system since then in planning and prototyping products the company has been using ucwinroad positively for obtaining data that cannot be obtained without actually driving a car for instance in the abovementioned development of the vehicle management system it is required to grasp the vehicles position speed and warning situations etc in real time as a system to handle this they conduct evaluation and verification in the environment closer to the information from the actual car by producing the gps or can information on the vehicle in simulation in addition they assume practical operation of the unattended taxi in studying automatic driving they made an animation work promotion video showing the image of the system which the user operates while making reservation with a smartphone through the cloud server along with representation of use scenes they also made pilot prior evaluation of the information they want to obtain from the car side we were able to demonstrate that prior evaluation can be conducted in such a way even though actual cars are not used for something still in the conceptual stage through events etc however since it was applied to the unattended taxi that was ahead of times actual situation of the unattached taxi itself was apparently hard to be understood considering this they then developed the vehicle management system that allows the user to grasp and manage the position speed and conditions in real time for a wide range of automaticoperated cars and trucks of freight companies etc based on the original idea this has been made into animation with ucwinroad to use for prior evaluation as mr sedo says further applying them they devised its usage to transmit the demonstration information of the vehicle management system to the smartglasses to allow the driver to watch necessary information while keeping on looking ahead without taking a look at the car navigation system it also supports prior evaluation by linking this with the vr created with ucwinroad　 smartglasses basically we are using this for presenting the companys activities in exhibitions and so on but it is also an advantage of ucwinroad in that we can bring a laptop computer in visiting a client who is interested in us to explain in an easytounderstand way   evolution around automobiles and prior evaluation it is expected that iot will be widespread connecting automobiles to the internet and promoting collection of big data on automobiles mr sedo believes that inclination towards the world where those data can be accessed from outside will increase more when such a situation occurs it is difficult to conduct prior evaluation by using actual cars as to what kind of data
