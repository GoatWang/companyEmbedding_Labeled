court cause no dc memorandum opinion before justices bridges langmiers and evans opinion by justice langmiers william krueger appeals the trial court’s order dismissing his lawsuit against pulse evolution corp pulse moved to dismiss the lawsuit arguing that its employment agreement with krueger formerly pulse’s chief financial officer contained a forum selection clause and an arbitration clause requiring the parties to resolve their disputes in florida krueger argued that his claims do not fall within the scope of the employment agreement and are not subject to the forum selection clause we agree with pulse and affirm the trial court’s order dismissing krueger’s claims background pulse states in its motion to dismiss that it is a nevada corporation with its headquarters in florida it is a digital production and intellectual property company that produces specialized highimpact applications of computergenerated human likeness for use in entertainment life sciences

pulse terminated his employment krueger asked pulse to inform its current and prospective investors and the public generally that he was no longer associated with pulse however pulse continued to represent krueger as pulse’s cfo on its website and krueger sued pulse in dallas county the lawsuit alleged among other things that pulse misappropriated krueger’s name and represented that krueger was still affiliated with pulse to induce creditors and vendors to extend services and accept stock and equity in pulse pulse moved to dismiss krueger’s claims pursuant to the forum selection clause

meaning was intended see valance operating co v dorsett  swd   tex  discussion in his “issue presented” krueger argues that the trial court erred by granting pulse’s motion to dismiss and dismissing his lawsuit based on paragraph  of the employment agreement within this issue krueger makes two points  the trial court erred by dismissing his lawsuit “because the narrow forum selection clause in the employment agreement which applies only to ‘disputes under the agreement’ does not apply to the dismissed claims” and  “the trial court erred to the extent that it found the arbitration clause in the employment agreement to apply in this case” we address krueger’s first point krueger’s claims are noncontractual whether they fall within the scope of the employment agreement’s forum selection clause depends on the parties’ intent as expressed in the agreement and a commonsense examination of the substance of the allegations pinto tech –– ventures lp v sheldon no   wl  at  tex may   krueger challenges only the parties’ intent as expressed in the forum selection clause the first sentence of paragraph  of the employment agreement states that “any dispute under this agreement shall be arbitrated” in palm beach county florida the forum selection clause which is found much later in the paragraph states “in the event that arbitration cannot be compelled or in order to enforce arbitration” exclusive jurisdiction lies in port st lucie county florida krueger acknowledges that the forum selection clause does not contain the modifying language “under this agreement” that is contained in the arbitration clause but he contends that the forum selection clause should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to “disputes under the agreement” see rsr corp  swd at – discussing difference between claim that arises “under” agreement and one that “arises out of” or “relates to” agreement he argues that “a common sense examination of his claims in this case shows that they are based entirely on statutory and common law rather than any breach” of the employment agreement pulse on the other hand argues that the parties’ omission of the modifying language “under this agreement” in the forum selection clause is evidence that the parties did not intend to limit the forum selection clause only to disputes that sought to enforce the agreement see id explaining that claim “under” agreement sought to enforce agreement pulse also argues that to adopt krueger’s interpretation would render portions of the paragraph in conflict or meaningless we agree with pulse the modifying language “under this agreement” is found only in the arbitration clause which is the first sentence of paragraph  the forum selection clause found in lines – of paragraph  states that it applies to disputes in which arbitration cannot be compelled additionally each clause selects a different county in florida as the forum for dispute resolution to give meaning to both the arbitration clause and the forum selection clause –– the forum selection clause must refer to disputes that are not subject to the arbitration clause that is disputes that do not arise “under this agreement” if the parties wanted this modifying language to apply to the forum selection clause they could have said so see michiana easy livin’ country inc v holten  swd  – tex  and we will not add words to a contract under the guise of interpretation lg ins mgmt servs lp v leick  swd   tex app—dallas  pet denied any other interpretation would render the arbitration clause and the forum selection clause in conflict we conclude that the parties did not limit the forum selection clause to disputes that arise “under this agreement” and the clause is not so limited and because appellant does not otherwise argue that the forum selection clause does not apply we resolve krueger’s first point against him and do not need to reach his second point conclusion we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting pulse’s motion to dismiss we affirm the trial court’s order elizabeth langmiers elizabeth langmiers justice fp –– s court of appeals fifth district of texas at dallas

micromachining contact inspection request clarkmxr inc was incorporated in october of  as a michigan company to acquire the assets of two other operating companies clark instrumentation inc in pittsford new york and mxr inc in dexter michiganclark instrumentation inc cii was founded in november  by dr bill clark to make ultrafast pulse laser instrumentation for the scientific research market its first product was a colliding pulse modelocked dye laser cpm that produced sub fs pulses at a wavelength of  nm with a repetition rate of  mhz and an average power output of  mw by  cii had three main commercial products the cpm a dyebased multipass amplifier and an autocorrelator all sales marketing and manufacturing was done out of the pittsford ny officeat the cleo conference in  professor wilson sibbett of st andrews university in scotland gave his nowfamous invited paper in which he stunned the laser community with his report of stable selfmodelocking in tisapphire following this report cii committed itself to the commercial development of a modelocked tisapphire oscillator based on its cpm cavity design the company was the first to announce a commercial selfmodelocked tisapphire laser oscillator in the december  issue of laser focus world it delivered the first commercial tisapphire oscillator in june of paralleling the evolution of cii was the development of the progenitor to medox research a company called medox electrooptics inc medox eo was started in  as a new york corporation based in rochester ny by drs philippe bado marcel bouvier and gerard mourou three scientists who at the time were working at the university of rochester the companys main product was a pockels cell driver based on a microwave tube a pockel cell is used to switch in and switch out a seed pulse in an amplifier and is an integral component to chirped pulse amplifier technology that had been invented in professor mourous group medox eo and its staff moved to ann arbor when dr mourou started the center for ultrafast optical science cuos at the university of michiganin  philippe bado started medox research mxr to develop a khz commercial tisapphire amplifier based on the concept of chirped pulse amplification cpa shortly after philippe founded mxr philippe and bill began discussing a collaboration to satisfy the growing market interest in a complete cpa system for a little over a year cii served as the sales and marketing representative for the two separate companies selling complete systems with the oscillator and autocorrelator made by cii and the regenerative amplifier made by mxr it was during this period that it became apparent to both bill and philippe that the two companies had similar goals and complementary strengths and so they decided to merge the two companies into one forming clarkmxr inc in since their inception these companies have lead the field with the introduction of many ultrafast laser products homeabout uscompany historymessage from
