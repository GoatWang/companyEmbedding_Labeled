displays require higher performance such as high resolution and low power consumption than the conventional displays do aegishr series are the exposure system for manufacturing ultra high resolution displays to apply to the smartphones and the tablet pcs etc by adopting the uniquelydeveloped microlens array mla optical system which is different from that included in the previous system   see improvement of display – enhance resolution and image quality described below   hr stands for high resolution   mla microlens array means that the microlenses are arranged in a grid pattern   see “impact on display design by high resolution” described below mla   features high resolution this system achieves μm exposure resolution by mla micro lens allay it leads to producing the high resolution displays which are equivalent to or more than  pixels per inch ppi as of the end of september  high alignment accuracy optical system by mla for aegishr is quite simple structure compared with that of typical projection type exposure this allows aegishr to realize high alignment accuracy high productivity g glass substrate mm which can produce more number of panels in a sheet than  g

resolution and low power consumption for displays fine patterns are required   aperture ratio ratio of the area to pass through lights in sub pixels if the display adopts the high resolution without changing the line width of the black matrix frame bm it reduces the aperture ratio to maintain the same brightness it is necessary to brighten the backlight and then the power consumption increases as
