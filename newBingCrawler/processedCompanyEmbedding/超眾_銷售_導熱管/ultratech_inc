customers located throughout the world ultratech was incorporated in the state of delaware in  recent developments on february   the company veeco instruments inc a delaware corporation “veeco” and ulysses acquisition subsidiary corp a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of veeco “merger subsidiary” entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” pursuant to which among other things merger subsidiary will be merged with and into the company the “merger” with the company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of veeco subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement the boards of directors of both veeco and the company have approved the transaction the closing of the merger is subject to the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and to various other customary conditions including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the “hsr act” with respect to which the us federal trade commission granted early termination on february   the absence of any temporary restraining order preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger and the sec having declared effective a registration statement on form s with respect to the shares of veeco common stock issuable in connection with the merger in addition it is a condition to closing of the merger that the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis have at least  million of cash on hand held in the united states pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein upon the closing of the merger each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the merger other than shares of our

from the us federal trade commission that it had granted early termination effective immediately of the applicable waiting period under the hsr act for the merger the early termination of the waiting period under the hsr act satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the merger which remains subject to other closing conditions including the adoption of the merger agreement by requisite vote of our stockholders our business lithography and ald we supply stepandrepeat photolithography systems based on onetoone “x” imaging technology to customers located throughout north america europe and asia we believe that our x steppers utilizing the wynne dyson optical design offer cost and performance advantages as compared with competitors’ contact aligners or reduction steppers to semiconductor  device manufacturers for applications involving line geometries of  microns or greater “noncritical feature sizes” and to nanotechnology manufacturers advanced packaging manufacturing processes such as flip chip wafer level chip scale packaging “wlcsp” and d packaging techniques require several lithography steps in the device fabrication process we believe that the use of flip chip technology will continue to gain traction as customers migrate towards leading edge technology nodes it is expected that wafer level packaging technologies will continue to play an important role for continued miniaturization of electronic products such as smartphones as customers transition to sub nanometers “nm” manufacturing technology traditional front end scaling is becoming increasingly complex as such semiconductor manufacturing companies are now also focusing on various packaging technologies such as fan out wafer package “fowlp” and through silicon via “tsv” to play an important role in delivering improved system level performance in the future the manufacturing approach utilizing fowlp or tsv technology alleviates interconnect delay considerations by reducing global interconnect wiring length these advanced packaging techniques deliver superior bandwidth performance power management improvements and address some device latency issues in addition several of our customers are also evaluating other packaging approaches such as silicon interposer technology solutions for delivering improved bandwidth and system level performance lithography is one of the critical process steps that affect the final device performance and associated yield for advanced packaging technology the use of x stepper technology provides superior operational flexibility for thick resists utilized in the advanced packaging market furthermore the use of our proprietary alignment systems enables easy insertion of our products for any back end of line application lastly we have also developed a large number of application specific features which deliver technology leadership and superior economic value for our packaging customers our steppers are used to manufacture high volume low cost semiconductor devices used in a variety of applications such as communications personal computing automotive control systems power systems and consumer electronics we believe that our steppers offer advantages over certain competitive reduction lithography tools with respect to field size throughput specialized substrate handling and cost of ownership savings in december  we purchased certain assets of cambridge nanotech inc “cambridge” which was a technological leader in the ald market we will continue to pursue selling opportunities in the ald market focusing our efforts on universities and research institutes additionally we may sell these products for production applications laser anneal technology device scaling has been the predominant means pursued by the semiconductor industry to achieve the gains in productivity and performance quantified by moore’s law in the past several years scaled device performance has been compromised because traditional transistor materials such as silicon silicon dioxide and polysilicon have been pushed to their fundamental materials limits continued scaling thus requires the introduction of new materials for example the traditional gate dielectric has been silicon dioxide and as devices are scaled below  nm highk material such as hafnium oxide must be considered because silicon dioxide begins to lose its effectiveness these new materials impose added challenges to the methods used to dope and activate silicon to produce very shallow highly activated junctions the main challenges regarding short channel effects include achieving maximum activation and minimal diffusion while maintaining abrupt junctions by leveraging our core competencies in optics engineering and system integration and our extensive knowledge of laser thermal processing we introduced our laser spike annealing system to enable thermal annealing solutions at the  nm technology node and below this advanced annealing technology provides solutions to the difficult challenge of fabricating ultrashallow junctions and highly activated sourcedrain contacts laser thermal processing offers the flexibility to operate at nearinstantaneous timeframes microseconds to milliseconds at temperatures below the melting point of silicon ° c at these temperatures and anneal times high activation is achieved with negligible diffusion in addition our proprietary hardware design minimizes the pattern density effect reducing absorptivity variations resulting in a uniform temperature across the wafer inspection in  we introduced a new inline wafer inspection system based on patented coherent gradient sensing technology “cgs” named superfast the cgs technology was developed at the california institute of technology during the ’s and we acquired the rights to develop the cgs technology when we acquired certain assets of a semiconductor inspection startup oraxion inc in july  we developed a nextgeneration system in  which was primarily used internally our latest model introduced in  superfast g represents the fourth generation of this technology which is focused on the inspection of a number of critical semiconductor process steps  our products and markets are more fully described below general background the fabrication of devices such as integrated circuits “semiconductors” or “ics” requires a large number of complex processing steps including deposition photolithography and etching photolithography is one of the most critical and expensive steps in ic device manufacturing photolithography exposure equipment is used to create device features by patterning a lightsensitive polymer coating on the wafer surface using a photomask containing the master image of a particular device layer typically each exposure results in the patterning of a different deposited layer and therefore requires a different pattern on the device each new device layer must be properly aligned to previously defined layers before imaging takes place so that structures formed on the wafers are correctly placed one on top of the other in order to ensure a functioning device since the introduction of the earliest commercial photolithography tools for ic manufacturing in the early s a number of tools have been introduced to enable manufacturers to produce ever more complex devices that incorporate progressively finer line widths in the early s photolithography tools included contact printers and proximity aligners which required the photomask to physically contact or nearly contact the wafer in order to transfer the entire pattern during a single exposure by the mids there were also projection scanners which transferred the device image through reflective optics having a very narrow annular field that spanned the width of the wafer exposure was achieved by scanning the entire photomask and wafer in a single continuous motion across the annular field scanners were followed by steppers which expose a rectangular area or field on the wafer containing one or more chip patterns in a single exposure then move or “step” the wafer to an adjacent site to repeat the exposure this stepping process is repeated as often as necessary until the entire wafer has been exposed by imaging a small area steppers are able to achieve finer resolution improved image size control and better alignment between the multiple device layers resulting in higher yield and higher performance devices than was possible with earlier tools the two principal types of steppers currently in use by the semiconductor industry are reduction steppers which are the most widelyused steppers and x steppers reduction steppers which typically have reduction ratios of four or fivetoone employ photomask patterns that are four or five times larger than the device pattern that is to be exposed on the wafer surface in addition there is a fourth generation of lithography tools known as stepandscan systems that typically address device sizes of  micron and below in contrast to steppers which require lenses that cover the entire field stepandscan optical systems have an instantaneous field just large enough to span the width of a field and employ scanning to stretch coverage over the entire field each scan is followed by reregistration of the wafer with respect to the mask ie “stepping” to create multiple fields covering the entire wafer the smaller instantaneous field size of stepandscan system projection optical systems allows them to resolve finer geometries and scanning allows them to cover larger fields the principal advantage of reduction steppers and stepandscan systems is that they may be used in manufacturing steps requiring critical feature sizes and are therefore necessary for manufacturing advanced ics x steppers on the other hand employ photomask patterns that are the same scale as the device pattern that is exposed on the wafer surface the optical projection system employed in our x steppers is based on a wynne dyson design which uses both a reflective mirror and refractive lens elements this design approach leads to a very simple and versatile optical system that is less expensive than those employed in reduction steppers because our x optical design covers a much broader spectral range than reduction steppers it delivers a greater proportion of the exposure energy from the lamp to the wafer surface depending on the size of the lamp used and the exposure energy required for an application this can result in appreciably higher throughput resolution considerations currently limit x steppers to manufacturing steps involving lesscritical larger feature sizes accordingly we believe that sales of these systems are highly dependent upon capacity expansions by our current x customers or by customers making the transition to chips containing “bump” connections that facilitate the use of higher data rates and a higher number of connections in the past manufacturers of ics and similar devices purchased capital equipment based principally on performance specifications in view of the significant capital expenditures required to construct equip and maintain advanced fabrication facilities relatively short product cycles and manufacturers’ increasing concern for overall fabrication costs we believe that focus has shifted to the total cost of ownership cost of ownership includes the costs associated with the acquisition of equipment as well as components based on throughput yield uptime service labor overhead maintenance and various other costs associated with owning and using the equipment as a result in many cases the most technologically advanced system will not necessarily be the manufacturing system that delivers the best cost of ownership  in addition to enhancing our current lithography solutions we continue to develop new tools to serve markets such as advanced annealing the lsa family of tools is aimed at volume production of advanced semiconductors these products based on the same platform and stage technology as our advanced lithography tools employ a  watt carbon dioxide laser to activate ultrashallow transistor junctions annealing times are reduced from several seconds typical for the current generation of rapid thermal processing “rtp” equipment to a millisecond or less this results in more abrupt junctions with higher dopant activation levels and leads to transistors with higher drive currents and lower leakage while this technology is expected to be useful for multiple ic generations we anticipate that eventually this technology will be superseded by a laser thermal processing technology that will exceed the melting point of silicon °c and reduce the processing time below one microsecond thereby achieving even higher performance characteristics with almost “zero” thermal budget we continue to develop our new lxa laser melt technology targeted to deliver this capability melt annealing has the potential to be used for multiple generations across the front end of line “feol” and middle of line “mol” we believe these new laser thermal processing technologies remove several critical barriers to future device scaling and will help to extend moore’s law well into the future thermal annealing is used by the semiconductor industry for a variety of process steps including activation of implanted impurities dopant activation dielectric film formation formation of silicides and stabilization of copper grain structures our lsa systems compete with annealing tools currently in use by manufacturers of semiconductor devices including both furnaces and rtp systems it is widely recognized that there is a need for tools that anneal at higher temperatures for shorter periods of time we believe our current laser annealing tools are already providing this capability in a production environment for dopant activation our customers are also working to develop other applications for our laser annealing tools such as highk dieletric anneal and silicide formation as the nextgeneration device nodes are developed the inspection requirements are rapidly evolving tighter device specifications new materials and new device geometries necessitate new ways to identify and eliminate the sources of defects that compromise device performance and reduce yield the cost of these defects is also increasing not only do individual wafers have more value but more importantly rapid resolution of defects and process issues can dramatically reduce timetomarket by enabling the ramp to high volume production sooner traditional inspection techniques can often be difficult to extend without significant increase in cost of ownership or decrease in throughput new inspection techniques that are accurate precise rapid and provide large amounts of data are essential for providing device manufacturers the insight into efficiently resolving manufacturing issues during development and highvolume production alike products we currently offer two different series of x lithography systems for use in the semiconductor fabrication process the  series which addresses the markets for hbled semiconductor fabrication and nanotechnology applications and the ap series which is designed to meet the requirements of the advanced packaging market these steppers currently offer minimum feature size capabilities ranging from  microns to  microns the  series systems are small field systems available with ghline iline and broadband ghiline illumination options we offer the sapphire c and sapphire e for hbled applications and the star  for semiconductor and nanotechnology applications these  series platform systems are typically used in the manufacture of hbleds power devices asics analog devices and compound semiconductors as well as a number of nanotechnology applications nanotechnology manufacturing combines electronics with mechanics in small devices we have defined a nanotechnology device as a device that has at least one dimension in the xyz direction less than  microns examples include accelerometers used to activate air bags in automobiles and membrane pressure sensors used in industrial control systems these micromachined devices are manufactured on silicon substrates using photolithography techniques similar to those used for manufacturing semiconductors our sapphire c and sapphire e systems are configurable with customized options designed specifically for high volume hbled manufacturing applications the sapphire c and sapphire e are also based on the  series platform with additional features developed specifically for hbled lithography applications hbled manufacturing requires special substrate handling capabilities for the small diameter sapphire and silicon carbide substrates used to manufacture the led devices for display backlighting and general lighting applications for hbled applications we believe our sapphire c and our sapphire e steppers offer depth of focus productivity and yield improvement advantages over competitive product offerings for the advanced packaging market we offer our ap series built on the unity platform ®  these advanced packaging systems were developed for high volume flipchip waferlevel and d packaging applications they provide broadband or  selective exposure gh i or ghiline and are used in conjunction with downstream processes to produce a pattern of bumps or metal connections on the bond pads of the die for flip chip devices using flip chip interconnect may result in reduced signal inductance reduced powerground inductance die shrink advantages and reduced package footprint the ap series consisting of the apw ap and ap is built on our unity platform and features a customerconfigurable design that supports flexible manufacturing requirements as well as tool extendibility for multiple device generations designed specifically for advanced packaging applications the ap systems integrate the processing advantages associated with our advanced packaging lithography equipment with the productivity benefits of our unity platform we believe that this family of lithography systems support a lower costofownership strategy due to significant throughput enhancements higher reliability and superior alignment and illumination systems we offer a family of advanced laserbased thermal annealing tools built on our unity platform in addition to our flagship model the lsa which enables junction activation and other advanced frontend annealing processes for the nm node and below we have introduced a novel dual beam technology extending the systems capabilities to lower processing temperatures lsalp the addition of the lp dual beam is targeted to enable mol applications such as silicide formation the lsa is our latest lsa product offering which enables fullwafer ambient control processing targeted for subnm nodes the lsas simple and robust design includes our patented microchamber design for achieving ambient control in a scanning system the lsa platform can also be configured with the dual beam laser mentioned abovenamed the lsalp as devices scale below nm we believe the ambient control capability enables new applications such as highk anneal and film property modification in  we introduced our new inline wafer inspection system the superfast g which provides the flexibility to address a wide range of applications including improved overlay control and enhanced yield in  we released our next generation version the superfast g at advanced technology nodes variations in stress and distortion on a wafer can have a significant impact on device performance and yield based on cgs technology we believe that our superfast system provides the industry’s highest wafer resolution for the targeted applications and measures over  million points of data per mm wafer the superfast system is unique in that it collects data from the whole wafer simultaneously providing significantly higher data density without the need for targets or pads the system’s high data density enables a wide range of applications from one measurement as withindie dietodie and wafertowafer process variations can be characterized quickly and comprehensively utilizing the superfast system provides other key advantages as well first data is obtained within each die at the location of the devices not the location of a test target and withindie variations can be mapped via approximately  data points second data acquisition is inherently faster using rapid image capture of the whole wafer with a camera third data is obtained to within mm of the wafer edge providing a means to characterize issues with edgedie which dominate yield loss at leading edge nodes in addition to selling new systems we sell upgrades to systems in our installed base     research development and engineering the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements we believe that continued and timely development and introduction of new and enhanced systems to serve these markets is essential for us to maintain our competitive position we have made and continue to make substantial investments in the research and development of our core optical technology which we believe is critical to our future financial results we intend to continue to develop our technology and to develop innovative lower cost of ownership products and product features to meet customer demands current engineering projects include continued research and development and process insertion for our laser thermal processing technologies continued development of our x stepper products ongoing evolution of our inspection technologies as well as other new products other research and development efforts are currently focused on performance enhancement and development of new features for existing systems both for inclusion as a standard component in our systems and to meet special customer order requirements increased productivity reliability improvements and manufacturing cost reductions these research and development efforts are principally undertaken by our research development and engineering organizations and costs are generally expensed as incurred other operating groups within ultratech support our research development and engineering efforts and the associated costs are expensed as incurred we work with many customers to jointly develop technology required to manufacture advanced devices or to lower the customer’s cost of ownership we also have a worldwide engineering support organization including reticle engineering photo processing capability and applications support  we have historically devoted a significant portion of our financial resources to research and development programs and expect to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future as of december    we had approximately  fulltime employees engaged in research development and engineering for    and   total research development and engineering expenses were approximately  million   million and  million  respectively and represented    and  of our net sales respectively sales and service we market and sell our products in north america europe and asia principally through our direct sales organization we also have service personnel based throughout the united states europe japan and the rest of asia we believe that as semiconductor and nanotechnology device manufacturers produce increasingly complex devices they will require an increased level of support global support capability as well as product reliability performance yield cost uptime and mean time between failures are increasingly important factors by which customers evaluate potential suppliers of photolithography equipment we believe that the strength of our worldwide service and support organization is an important factor in our ability to sell our systems maintain customer loyalty and reduce the maintenance costs of our systems in addition we believe that working with our suppliers and customers is necessary to ensure that our systems are cost effective technically advanced and designed to satisfy customer requirements we support our customers with field service applications technical support service engineers and training programs we provide our customers with comprehensive support and service before during and after delivery of our systems to support the sales process and to enhance customer relationships we work closely with prospective customers to develop hardware applications test specifications and benchmarks and often design customized applications to enable prospective customers to evaluate our equipment for their specific needs prior to shipment our support personnel typically assist the customer onsite preparation and inspection and provide customers with training at our facilities or at the customer’s location we currently offer our customers various courses of instruction on our systems including instructions in system hardware and related applications tools for optimizing our systems to fit a customer’s particular needs our customer training program also includes instructions in the maintenance of our systems our field support personnel work with the customer to install the system and demonstrate system readiness technical support is also available via telephone  hours a day seven days a week at our san jose california and singapore locations and through our onsite personnel in general we warrant our new systems against defects in design materials and workmanship for one year we offer our customers additional support after the warranty period for a fee in the form of service contracts for specified time periods service contracts include various options such as priority response planned preventive maintenance scheduled oneonone training daily onsite support and monthly system and performance analysis manufacturing until the third quarter of  we performed all of our manufacturing activities final assembly system testing and certain subassembly in clean room environments totaling approximately  square feet located in san jose california performing manufacturing operations in california exposes us to a higher risk of natural disasters including earthquakes in addition california has previously experienced power shortages which have interrupted our operations such shortages could occur in the future and could again interrupt our operations resulting in product shipment delays increased costs and other problems any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business customer relationships and results of operations beginning in the fourth quarter of  we started a manufacturing operation in singapore for the production of our lithography and inspection products this facility consists of approximately  square feet of additional cleanroom production space for the manufacturing of our advanced packaging unity ap products hbled sapphire and superfast inspection product platforms our manufacturing activities consist of assembling and testing components and subassemblies which are then integrated into finished systems we rely on a limited number of outside suppliers and subcontractors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies we order one of the most critical components of our technology the glass for our x lenses from external suppliers we design the x lenses and provide the lens specifications and the glass to external suppliers who then machine the lens elements we then assemble and test the optical x lenses we have recorded the critical parameters of each of our optical lenses sold since  and we believe that such information enables us to supply lenses to our customers that match the characteristics of our customers’ existing lenses we procure some of our other critical systems’ components subassemblies and services from single outside suppliers or from a limited group of outside suppliers in order to ensure overall quality and timeliness of delivery many of these  components and subassemblies have significant production lead times to date we have been able to obtain adequate services and supplies of components and subassemblies for our systems in a timely manner we are actively engaged with a number of our asiabased suppliers to provide high precision parts and major optomechanical and electromechanical subassemblies and modules for our lithography products both in singapore and san jose however disruption or termination of certain of these sources could result in a significant adverse impact on our ability to manufacture our systems this in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers and our reliance on subcontractors exposes us to several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to the suppliers’ failure or inability to provide such components in a timely manner or at all to our standards of quality and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process and long leadtimes are required any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we maintain a companywide quality and environmental program our san jose operations achieved iso  certification in  and iso  certification in march  our san jose iso  certification was upgraded to the iso  standard in january  and to the iso  standard in june  our san jose iso  certification was upgraded to the iso  standard in june  our iso  and  certifications were expanded to our singapore operation in august  all certifications have been maintained uninterrupted through the date of this report competition the capital equipment industry in which we operate is intensely competitive a substantial investment is required to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor semiconductor packaging or nanotechnology device production line we believe that once a device manufacturer or packaging subcontractor has selected a particular supplier’s capital equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and to the extent possible subsequent generations of similar products accordingly it is difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another supplier’s capital equipment has been selected as they are relying on reduced cost of ownership solutions and a decision by a customer to change solutions could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results   advanced packaging and hbled lithography   we experience competition in the advanced packaging lithography market from various reduction steppers and proximity and projection aligner companies such as canon incorporated nikon corporation “nikon” suss microtec ag “suss microtec” rudolph technologies inc “rudolph” shanghai micro electronics equipment co ltd “smee” orc manufacturing co ltd ushio and from third party resale of used projection systems we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics this could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our steppers in our served markets and thereby materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations enhancements to or future generations of competing products may be developed that offer superior cost of ownership and technical performance features we believe that to be competitive we will require significant financial resources to continue to invest in new product development to invest in new features and enhancements to existing products to introduce new generation stepper systems in our served markets on a timely basis and to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide in marketing our products we may also face competition from suppliers employing other technologies in addition increased competitive pressure has led to intensified pricebased competition in certain of our markets resulting in lower prices and margins should these competitive trends continue our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected our primary competition in the hbled lithography market comes from contact proximity and projection aligners offered by companies such as suss microtec ushio and ev group by stepper companies such as smee as well as by third party sales of used reduction steppers including nikon and asml although contact proximity aligners and used reduction steppers generally have lower purchase prices than new x steppers x steppers offer lower operating costs and favorable total cost of ownership in most applications we believe that most device and hbled manufacturers choose x steppers for the yield improvement and lower modification costs offered by the use of noncontact projection lithography laser thermal processing    with respect to our laser annealing technologies marketed under the lsa product name our primary competition comes from companies such as screen semiconductor solutions co ltd applied materials inc “applied materials” and mattson technology many of these companies also offer products utilizing rtp which is the dominant manufacturing technology for devices above nm the dopant diffusion in the lateral dimension resulting from the time scales associated with rtp limits the scaling of transistors to advanced technology nodes shorter annealing times result in shallower and more abrupt junctions and faster transistors we believe that rtp manufacturers recognize the need to reduce thermal budgets and are working toward this goal several companies offer annealing tools that incorporate flash lamp anneal “fla” technology a potential advanced annealing solution in order to reduce annealing times and increase anneal temperatures this technique which employs flash lamps has shown improvements over rtp in junction depth and sheet resistance but we believe fla suffers from patternrelated nonuniformities and could require additional costly processes to equalize the reflectivity of different areas within the chip or wafer our proprietary laser thermal processing solution has been specifically developed to provide junction annealing on nearinstantaneous timescales while achieving high activation levels and doing so very uniformly across the chip and within the wafer due to our unique long wavelength technology lsa our first implementation of laser thermal processing activates dopants in the microsecondtomillisecond time frame without melting our research indicates that at temperatures just below the melting point of silicon time durations in the microsecond to millisecond range are required to achieve full activation with minimal dopant diffusion   in july  we licensed certain rights to our then existing laser thermal processing technology with reservations to a competing manufacturer of semiconductor equipment this company and others currently offer laser annealing tools to the semiconductor industry that compete with our offerings inspection competition for the superfast inspection systems comes from a wide range of companies including large companies such as klatencor as well as numerous smaller companies developing and manufacturing inspection equipment such as nanometrics rudolph frontier semiconductor fsm and nova measuring instruments similarly there is an extremely wide range of technologies and approaches used by the competitors each individual technology will have advantages for certain specific inspection applications in general these competitors offer systems that inspect and measure at one location on the wafer or one data point at a time this can limit overall data density to only a few hundred data points per wafer as well as limit throughput in addition these competitive systems often require dedicated targets pads or other special features in order to make a measurement making them less flexible in production environments intellectual property rights although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets and other measures we believe that our success will depend more upon the innovation technological expertise and marketing abilities of our employees nevertheless we have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions resulting from our ongoing research and development and manufacturing activities our intellectual property portfolio contains  patents and patent applications we have patent expiration dates ranging from april  to june  in addition we also have various registered trademarks and copyright registrations covering mainly applications used in the operation of our systems we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we may not be able to protect our technology adequately and competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently our pending patent applications may not be issued or us or foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights in addition litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents copyrights or other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement such litigation has resulted in and in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the outcome of the litigation patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us furthermore others may independently develop similar technology or products or if patents are issued to us design around the patents issued to us invalidation of our patents related to those technologies or the expiration of patents covering our key technologies could allow our competitors to more effectively compete against us which could result in less revenue for us environmental regulations we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge handling emission generation manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed  on us suspension of production and alteration of the manufacturing process or cessation of operations in order to comply with such regulations we may be required to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses any failure by us to control the use disposal or storage of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities customers applications and markets we sell our systems to semiconductor advanced packaging hbled mems and various other nanotechnology manufacturers located throughout north america europe and asia we sell our ald systems to universities and research institutes throughout the world semiconductor manufacturers have purchased the  series steppers the ap series of steppers the nanotech steppers the lsa systems or the superfast systems for the fabrication andor packaging of microprocessors applications processors microcontrollers drams asics and a host of other devices such systems could be used in mixandmatch applications with other production tools such as for replacements of contact proximity printers for flip chip applications and for high volume capacity production on a market application basis sales to the semiconductor industry primarily for advanced packaging and laser thermal processing applications accounted for approximately  of systems revenue for the year ended december    as compared to  and  for the years ended december   and   respectively during the years ended december     and   approximately    and  respectively of our systems revenue was derived from sales to nanotechnology manufacturers including led and mems manufacturers our future results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely impacted by a downturn in any of these industries or by loss of market share in any of these industries international sales accounted for approximately    and  of total net sales for the years ended december     and   respectively with asia representing    and  of total net sales for those same years and europe representing    and  of total net sales for those same years respectively sales of our systems depend in significant part upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or to restructure current manufacturing facilities either of which typically involves a significant commitment of capital many of our customers in the past have cancelled or postponed the development of new manufacturing facilities and have substantially reduced their capital equipment budgets in view of the significant investment involved in a system purchase we have experienced and may continue to experience delays following initial qualification of our systems as a result of delays in a customer’s approval process additionally we are presently receiving orders for some systems that have lengthy delivery schedules which may be due to longer production lead times or a result of customers’ capacity scheduling requirements for these and other reasons our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale lengthy sales cycles subject us to a number of significant risks including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results over which we have little or no control in order to maintain or exceed our present level of net sales we are dependent upon obtaining orders for systems that will ship and be accepted in the current period we may not be able to obtain those orders backlog we schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog informal customer commitments and general economic forecasts for our targeted markets we include in our backlog all accepted customer orders for our systems with assigned shipment dates within one year as well as all orders for service spare parts and upgrades in each case that management believes to be firm however all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties because of changes in system delivery schedules cancellations of orders and potential delays in system shipments our backlog at any particular date may not necessarily be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period as of december    our backlog was approximately  million including  million of products shipped but not yet installed as of december    our backlog was approximately  million including  million of products shipped but not yet installed cancellation deferrals or rescheduling of orders by these customers would have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations employees at december    we had approximately  fulltime employees including  engaged in research development and engineering  in sales and marketing  in customer service and support  in manufacturing and  in general administration and finance we believe our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we have however entered  into employment agreements with our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we consider our relationships with our employees to be good information available at the securities and exchange commission copies of any materials that we have filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” can be viewed at the sec’s public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  information regarding the operations of the public reference room can be obtained from the sec by calling the sec at sec additionally the sec maintains a website that contains reports proxy and other information that we have filed with the sec the sec website can be found at httpwwwsecgov information available on our website our website is located at http wwwultratechcom  we make available free of charge through our website our annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed electronically with the sec item ia risk factors in addition to risks described in the foregoing discussions under “business” including but not limited to those under “products” “research development and engineering” “sales and service” “manufacturing” “competition” “intellectual property rights” “environmental regulations” “customers applications and markets” “backlog” and “employees” the following risks apply to our business and us the semiconductor industry historically has been highly cyclical and has experienced periods of oversupply and technology changes which have in turn affected the market for semiconductor equipment such as ours and which can adversely affect our results of operations during such periods our business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors advanced packaging semiconductors and nanotechnology components which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and products utilizing such devices the semiconductor industry historically has been highly cyclical and has experienced recurring periods of oversupply and technology changes this has from time to time resulted in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment and pricing pressure including on the systems manufactured and marketed by us and uncertainty among our customers we believe that markets for new generations of semiconductors semiconductor packaging and inspection will also be subject to similar fluctuations our business and operating results would be materially adversely affected by downturns or slowdowns in the semiconductor packaging market or by loss of market share accordingly we may not be able to achieve or maintain our current or prior level of sales we attempt to mitigate the risk of cyclicality by participating in multiple markets including semiconductor semiconductor packaging semiconductor inspection and nanotechnology sectors as well as diversifying into new markets we believe that diversifying into new markets such as laserbased annealing for implant activation lithography steppers for d packaging hbled ald and inspection can help mitigate the effects of this cyclicality in our industry despite such efforts when one or more of such markets fails to become viable as we anticipate or experience an oversupply or downturn our net sales and operating results are materially adversely affected for example we have experienced less revenue from laser processing as a result of the semiconductor logic foundries’ inability to effectively increase yields in d finfet devices to a level required to invest in their production ramp and unpredictability in other markets that we serve customers who manufacture both logic and memory devices are expected to focus their capital spending on the memory sector at this time we believe that as a result of cyclicality and of other factors affecting our foundry customers such as shifting customer demand lower capacity utilization rates and changing product designs we have and we will continue to experience reduced sales the push out of orders to us and uncertainty in our business our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed as a result a change in the timing of recognition of revenue or a change in margins or product mix can have a significant impact on our operating results in any particular quarter forecast uncertainty also makes it difficult for us to manage inventory levels factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include but are not limited to • market conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries  • failure of suppliers to perform in a manner consistent with our expectations • customer cancellations or pushouts or delays in orders shipments installations andor system acceptances • competitive factors including customers selecting competitors’ products the introduction of new products by our competitors or any failure of our products to gain or maintain market acceptance • changes in selling prices and product mix • manufacturing difficulties or delays and • product performance issues we are dependent on our key personnel especially mr zafiropoulo our chief executive officer and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected if we were to lose our key employees our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of key personnel many of whom would be difficult to replace we have entered into employment agreements only with our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and our employees are employed “at will” the agreements with our chief executive officer and chief financial officer contain vesting acceleration and severance payment provisions that could result in significant costs or charges to us should the employee be terminated without cause die or become disabled we do not maintain any life insurance on any of our key employees the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our future operating results depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified management manufacturing technical sales and support personnel for our operations there are only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire such personnel over time at times competition for such personnel has been intense particularly in the san francisco bay area where we maintain our headquarters and principal operations and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel the failure to attract or retain such persons would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there are risks and uncertainties associated with the merger with veeco the merger whether or not consummated may result in a loss of our key personnel and may disrupt our sales and marketing or other key business activities including our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties which may have an adverse impact on our financial performance our business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and following the completion of the merger those of the combined company additionally we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial financial advisory legal and other professional fees and expenses in connection with the merger which we must pay regardless of whether the merger is completed these payments will negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and financial condition parties with which we do business may be uncertain as to the effects on them from the merger and the related transactions including their current or future business relationships with us or the combined company  these relationships may be subject to disruption as customers suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to terminate change or renegotiate their relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or the combined company  these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company following the completion of the merger the risk and adverse effect of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement          the closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including the adoption and approval of the merger agreement by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hsr act with respect to which the us federal trade commission granted early termination on february   the absence of any temporary restraining order preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger in addition it is a condition to closing of the merger that the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis have at least  million of cash on hand held in the united states these conditions are described in more detail in the merger agreement which has been filed as exhibit  to our current report on form k filed with the sec on february   there is no assurance that all of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement will be satisfied or waived to the extent permitted by applicable law or that the merger will occur when or as expected if the merger is not completed the  share price of our common stock could decline for reasons including the loss of the premium over the preannouncement market price of our common stock that was to be paid upon consummation of the merger      under certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement upon termination of the merger agreement by us or veeco we may be required to pay to veeco a termination fee of  million which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do and increased competition could adversely impact sales of our products and our gross margins we are a comparatively small company in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment industry where we face competition from a number of companies many of which are larger and have greater financial engineering manufacturing research and development marketing and customer support resources than we do as a result our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of new products that are competitive with our products which could negatively impact sales of our systems moreover there has been merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors these transactions may result in our competitors accumulating an increased amount of resources allowing them to bring to market a portfolio of products and achieve a competitive “product grouping strategy” advantage over us as a result there is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market share at a desirable gross margin we operate in a highly competitive industry in which customers are required to invest substantial resources in each product which makes it difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another vendor’s equipment has been purchased by that customer the capital equipment industry in which we operate is intensely competitive a substantial investment is required to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor semiconductor inspection semiconductor packaging or nanotechnology device production line advanced technologies have also tended to become more capital intensive we believe that once a device manufacturer or packaging subcontractor has selected a particular supplier’s capital equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and to the extent possible subsequent generations of similar products accordingly it is difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another supplier’s capital equipment has been selected      we experience competition in advanced packaging from various proximity aligner and stepper companies such as canon incorporated nikon corporation orc manufacturing co ltd rudolph smee suss microtec ushio as well as from the secondary market from used projection and reduction stepper systems in nanotechnology we experience competition from contact proximity and projection aligner companies such as nikon engineering smee suss microtec and ushio as well as other third party stepper suppliers we expect our competitors in the lithography arena to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics this could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our steppers in our served markets and thereby materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations enhancements to or future generations of competing products may be developed that offer superior cost of ownership and technical performance features with respect to our laser annealing technologies marketed under the lsa and lsa product names our primary millisecond anneal competition comes from companies such as screen manufacturing co ltd applied materials and mattson technology inc some of these companies offer products utilizing rtp which is the current prevailing manufacturing technology rtp does not prevent semiconductor device manufacturers from scaling the lateral dimensions of their transistors to obtain improved performance but diffusion resulting from the time scales associated with rtp limits the vertical dimension of the junctions faster annealing times result in shallower and more abrupt junctions and faster transistors we believe that rtp manufacturers and semiconductor companies recognize the need to reduce thermal cycle times and are working toward this goal in july  we licensed certain rights to our then existing laser thermal processing technology with reservations to a competing manufacturer of semiconductor equipment we presently anticipate that this company and others intend to offer laser annealing tools to the semiconductor industry that will compete with our offerings another potential advanced annealing solution utilizes flash lamp annealing technology or “fla” several companies have published papers on annealing tools that incorporate flash lamp technology in order to reduce annealing times and increase annealing temperatures developers of fla technology claim to have overcome annealing difficulties at the advanced nodes this technique which employs flash lamps has shown improvements over rtp in junction depth and sheet resistance but we believe fla suffers from patternrelated nonuniformities and could require additional costly processes to equalize the reflectivity of different areas within the chip or wafer our proprietary laser thermal processing solution has been specifically  developed to provide junction annealing on nearinstantaneous timescales while achieving high activation levels laser thermal annealing our first implementation of laser thermal processing activates dopants in the microsecondtomillisecond time frame without melting our research indicates that at temperatures just below the melting point of silicon time durations in the microsecond to millisecond range are required to achieve full activation and minimal dopant diffusion additionally competition to our laser thermal processing products may come from other laser annealing tools including those presently being used by the flat panel display industry to recrystallize silicon manufacturers of these tools may try to extend the use of their technologies to semiconductor device applications in the market for inspection systems competition for inspection systems comes from a wide range of companies including large companies such as klatencor nanometrics rudolph and numerous smaller companies developing and manufacturing inspection equipment we believe that in order to be competitive we will need to continue to invest significant financial resources in new product development new features and enhancements to existing products the introduction of new stepper systems in our served markets on a timely basis and maintaining customer service and support centers worldwide in marketing our products we may also face competition from vendors employing other technologies in addition increased competitive pressure has led to intensified pricebased competition in certain of our markets resulting in lower prices and margins should these competitive trends continue our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected our sales cycle is typically lengthy and involves a significant commitment of capital by our customers which has subjected us and is likely to continue to subject us to delays in system acceptances of our products and other risks any of which could adversely impact our results of operations by among other things delaying recognition of revenue with respect to those orders and resulting in increased installation qualification and similar costs sales of our systems depend in significant part upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity replace older equipment or to restructure current manufacturing facilities any of which typically involves a significant commitment of capital many of our customers in the past have canceled or postponed the development of new manufacturing facilities and have substantially reduced their capital equipment budgets many of our largest customers currently face uncertainty in the markets they serve resulting in delays in placing new orders the push out of previous orders to us and uncertainty in our business in view of the significant investment involved in a system purchase we have experienced and may continue to experience unexpected delays following initial qualification of our systems as a result of delays in a customer’s approval process additionally we are presently receiving orders for systems that have lengthy delivery schedules which may be due to longer production lead times or a result of customers’ capacity scheduling requirements for these and other reasons our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale lengthy sales cycles subject us to a number of significant risks including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results over which we have little or no control in order to maintain or exceed our present level of net sales we are dependent upon obtaining orders for systems that will ship and be accepted in the current period we may not be able to obtain those orders other important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include • competitive pressures including pricing pressures from companies that have competing products • our customers’ or prospective customers’ perception of one or more of our board members • changes in customer product needs or product preferences and • strategic actions taken by our competitors our stock price has experienced significant volatility in the past and we expect this to continue in the future as a result of many factors some of which could be unrelated to our operating performance and such volatility can have a major impact on the number of shares subject to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units that are included in calculating our earnings per share we believe that factors such as announcements of developments related to our business fluctuations in our operating results a shortfall in revenue or earnings changes in our or analysts’ expectations general conditions in the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries or the worldwide or regional economies sales of our securities into the marketplace our share repurchase program an outbreak or escalation of hostilities announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by us or our competitors developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect it to continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future including fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance as of december    we had outstanding options to purchase and outstanding restricted stock units for a total of  million shares of our common stock among other determinants the market price of our stock has a major impact on the number of shares subject to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units that are included in the weightedaverage shares used in determining our net income per share during periods of extreme volatility the impact of higher stock prices can have a materially dilutive effect on our net income per share additionally shares subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation of net income per share when we have a net loss or when the exercise price and the average unrecognized compensation cost of the stock option or restricted stock unit is greater than the average market price of our common stock as the impact of the stock options or restricted stock units would be antidilutive our previously announced share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness furthermore the program does not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline we sell our products primarily to a limited number of customers and to customers in a limited number of industries which subjects us to increased risks related to the business performance of our customers and therefore their need for our products and the business cycles of the markets into which we sell historically we have sold a substantial portion of our systems to a limited number of customers for the year ended december    taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co ltd “tsmc” united microelectronics corporation powertech technology inc and semiconductor manufacturing north china beijing corporation “smnc” accounted for      and  of our total systems sales respectively for the year ended december    siliconware precision industries co ltd “spil” tsmc and intel corporation “intel” accounted for    and  of our system sales respectively we expect that sales to a relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future and believe that our financial results depend in significant part upon the success of these major customers and our ability to meet their future capital equipment needs although the composition of the group comprising our largest customers may vary from period to period the loss of a significant customer or any reduction or delay in orders by a significant customer including reductions or delays due to market economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor semiconductor packaging semiconductor inspection or nanotechnology industries or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing integrated circuits thin film heads or other nanotechnology components would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to maintain or increase our sales in the future depends in part on our ability to obtain orders from new customers as well as the financial condition and success of our existing customers the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries and the economy in general in addition to the business risks associated with dependence on a few major customers these significant customer concentrations have in the past resulted in significant concentrations of accounts receivable these significant and concentrated receivables expose us to additional risks including the risk of default by one or more customers representing a significant portion of our total receivables if we were required to take additional accounts receivable reserves our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected on a market application basis sales to the semiconductor industry primarily for advanced packaging applications and laser thermal processing applications accounted for  of our systems revenue for the year ended december    as compared to  for the year ended december    we sold  million of systems to nanotechnology manufacturers including micro systems thin film head ald and optical device manufacturers for the year ended december    as compared to  million in sales for the year ended december    systems revenue from the nanotechnology sector accounted for  of systems revenue for the year ended december    as compared to  revenue for the year ended december    our future operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted by a downturn in any of these industries or by loss of market share in any of these industries a growing percentage of our backlog  of system orders is comprised of laser thermal processing tools as our laser thermal processing tools are used for the continuation of reduced device geometries and customers seldom provide us with their future technical requirements these tools may not meet all customers’ requirements upon initial delivery and installation at the customer’s facility as a result system acceptance of the tool could be delayed while we perform testing and attempt to meet their requirements or the order could be cancelled if we are unable to meet those requirements should significant demand not materialize due to technical production market or other factors our business financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted we rely on a limited number of outside suppliers and subcontractors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies and on single or a limited group of outside suppliers for certain materials for our products which could result in a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to quality problems the suppliers’ failure or inability to provide such components in a timely manner or at all and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components and materials any of which could adversely affect our results of operations our manufacturing activities consist of assembling and testing components and subassemblies which are then integrated into finished systems we rely on a limited number of outside suppliers and subcontractors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies we order one of the most critical components of our technology the glass for our x lenses from external suppliers we design the x lenses and provide the lens specifications and the glass to other suppliers who then grind and polish the lens elements we then assemble and test the optical x lenses we procure some of our other critical systems’ components subassemblies and services from single outside suppliers or a limited group of outside suppliers in order to ensure overall quality and timeliness of delivery many of these components and subassemblies have significant production lead times to date we have been able to obtain adequate services and supplies of components and subassemblies for our systems in a timely manner however disruption or termination of certain of these sources could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to manufacture our systems in addition our failure to timely use components in our manufacturing processes due to delays or cancellation of orders or quality problems requiring us to return components may lead to write downs of inventory a disruption in supply or inventory window would in turn cause us to miss or delay shipments and would increase costs causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers and our reliance on subcontractors involve several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to the suppliers’ failure or inability to provide such components in a timely manner to our quality standards or at all and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process and long leadtimes are required any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry is subject to rapid technological change and product innovation which could result in our technologies and products being replaced by those of our competitors which would adversely affect our business and results of operations the semiconductor and nanotechnology manufacturing industries are subject to rapid technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements our ability to be competitive in these and other markets will depend in part upon our ability to develop new and enhanced systems and related applications and to introduce these systems and related applications at competitive prices and on a timely and costeffective basis to enable customers to integrate them into their operations either prior to or as they begin volume product manufacturing we will also be required to enhance the performance of our existing systems and related applications our success in developing new and enhanced systems and related applications depends upon a variety of factors including product selection timely and efficient completion of product design timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing product failures may result in customer dissatisfaction high service and support costs rework and increased inventory because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales new product decisions must anticipate both future customer requirements and the technology that will be available to meet those requirements we may not be successful in selecting developing manufacturing or marketing new products and related applications or enhancing our existing products and related applications any such failure would materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further we have in the past and may in the future make substantial investments in new products before we know whether they are technically feasible or commercially viable and as a result may incur significant product development expenses that do not result in new products or revenues  because of the large number of components in our systems significant delays can occur between a system’s introduction and our commencement of volume production of such systems we have experienced delays from time to time in the introduction of and technical and manufacturing difficulties with certain of our systems and enhancements and related application tools features and options and may experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements and related application tools features and options we may encounter additional technical manufacturing or other difficulties that could further delay future introductions or volume production of systems or enhancements our inability to complete the development or meet the technical specifications of any of our systems or enhancements and related applications or our inability to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements and related tools in volume and in time to meet the requirements for manufacturing the future generation of semiconductor or nanotechnology devices would materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our products early in the products’ life cycles if new products have reliability or quality problems reduced orders or higher manufacturing costs delays in system acceptance revenue recognition and collecting accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses may result any of such events may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we currently spend and expect to continue to spend significant resources to develop introduce and commercialize our offered products and future generations of and enhancements to these products we may not be successful in the timely introduction of these products which may cause sales of these products to decrease or not increase as expected currently we are devoting significant resources to the development introduction and commercialization of our laser thermal processing systems and other products and future generations of and enhancements to those products we intend to continue to develop these products and technologies and will continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research development and engineering manufacturing and general and administrative costs in order to develop produce and support these new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that our expenditures to develop these products will result in improved sales or that markets for these products will become viable additionally gross profit margins and inventory levels may be further adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of new products introduction of new products generally involves higher installation costs and product performance uncertainties that could delay system acceptance of our systems resulting in a delay in recognizing revenue associated with those systems and a reduction in gross margins these costs include but are not limited to additional manufacturing overhead additional inventory writedowns costs of demonstration systems and facilities and costs associated with the establishment of additional aftersales support organizations additionally operating expenses may increase relative to sales as a result of adding additional marketing and administrative personnel among other costs to support our new products if we are unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if our sales fall below expectations our operating results could be materially adversely affected our ability to commercialize our laser thermal processing technologies depends on our ability to demonstrate a manufacturingworthy tool we do not presently have inhouse capability to fabricate devices as a result we must rely on partnering with semiconductor companies to develop the anneal process the development of new process technologies is largely dependent upon our ability to interest potential customers in working on developing a process and providing timely and detailed feedback for system development our ability to deliver timely solutions is also limited by our customers understanding and communication of the future anneal requirements   changes in financial accounting standards or policies in the past have affected and in the future may affect our reported results of operations we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the fasb the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business including rules relating to revenue recognition offbalance sheet transactions employee stock options and other equity awards restructuring asset disposals and asset retirement obligations derivative and other financial instruments are regularly under review and subject to revision changes to those rules or the questioning of how we interpret or implement those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business in addition our preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting  period a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by natural disasters public health issues political instability wars and other military action as well as terrorist attacks and threats and government responses thereto especially if any such actions were directed at us or our facilities or customers public health issues political instability natural disasters terrorist attacks in the united states and elsewhere and government responses thereto may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers in addition such events could disrupt the semiconductor market resulting in the cancellation or delay of product orders significant public health issues could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a significant negative impact on the global economy us and our customers or suppliers should such incidents increase or other public health issues arise we could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in the availability of freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions and disruptions in the operations of our customers or suppliers similarly political instability could affect the ability of our suppliers to provide the materials needed in our operations or the cost of acquiring such materials any public health issues political instability natural disasters terrorist attacks or the ongoing war on terrorism or other wars could increase volatility in the united states and world financial markets which may depress the price of our common stock and may limit the capital resources available to us or our customers or suppliers which could result in decreased orders from customers less favorable financing terms from suppliers and scarcity or increased costs of materials and components of our products additionally if any of these events were to directly affect or be specifically directed at us or occur in a country where we or our suppliers or our customers operate our ability to conduct our business could be significantly disrupted any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility of the market price of our common stock we currently perform a significant amount of our manufacturing activities in cleanroom environments in san jose california an area known for seismic activity performing manufacturing operations in california exposes us to a higher risk of natural disasters including earthquakes in addition in the past california has experienced power shortages which have interrupted our operations such shortages could occur in the future further our suppliers andor customers may operate in areas subject to natural disasters the occurrence of which could affect their ability to continue to do business with us as expected or at all an earthquake other natural disaster power shortage or other similar events could interrupt or otherwise limit our operations or those of our suppliers or customers resulting in product shipment delays supply problems cancellations or deferrals of product orders increased costs and other problems any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business customer relationships and results of operations we continue to expand our manufacturing and service operations in singapore and customer support operations in other parts of the world which will continue to result in exposure to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states any of which risks could harm our business financial condition and operating results foreign operations subject us to risks related to the political economic legal and other conditions of foreign jurisdictions these risks include risks related to • foreign exchange rate fluctuations • the need to comply with foreign government laws and regulations including the imposition of regulatory requirements tariffs and import and export restrictions • general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships • the need for effective management of dispersed operations far from our headquarters in california • the potential for strain on management resources • difficulty in hiring and retaining local personnel for the successful operation of our business in each location • the need to effectively manage personnel in different languages and under different cultural and legal expectations and requirements in certain locations • meeting growth objectives and employment projections • potentially less protection of intellectual property under the laws of foreign jurisdictions in certain locations and • public safety or health concerns or natural disasters in foreign countries  these risks could among other things result in product shipment delays increased costs unexpected shutdowns or other business disruptions or loss of benefits expected to be achieved by conducting operations in affected jurisdictions any of the above risks should they occur could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a substantial portion of our sales are outside of the united states which subjects us to risks related to customer service installation foreign economic and political stability uncertain regulatory and tax rules and foreign exchange rate fluctuations all of which make it more difficult to operate our business international sales accounted for approximately  of total net sales for the year ended december    as compared to  for the year ended december    we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net sales although we generally transact our international sales in us dollars international sales expose us to a number of additional risk factors including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar which in turn impact the relative cost of ownership of our products and may further impact the purchasing ability of our international customers we have direct sales operations in japan and orders are often denominated in japanese yen this may subject us to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations we attempt to mitigate this exposure through foreign currency hedging we are also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductors and nanotechnology products we cannot predict whether the united states or any other country will implement changes to quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally by having a significant portion of our sales occur internationally we are continually exposed to political and economic instability difficulties in accounts receivable collections reduced protection of intellectual property natural disasters difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations and potentially adverse tax consequences to better align with the increasingly international nature of our business we transitioned certain manufacturing processes to singapore thereby bringing these activities closer to our asiabased customers this movement is somewhat recent and our experience in international manufacturing operations is not as extensive as in the us if we are unable to continue to successfully operate the site to efficiently manufacture systems our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted if we acquire companies products or technologies we may face risks associated with those acquisitions we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies personnel and products of the acquired companies the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company in the event we acquire product lines technologies or businesses which do not complement our business or which otherwise do not enhance our sales or operating results we may incur substantial writeoffs and higher recurring operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses future acquisitions may require use of substantial amounts of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event that any such acquisition does occur there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on our business or operating results changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations a number of factors may negatively impact our future effective tax rates including but not limited to   • the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed • changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities • increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes • changes in available tax credits • changes in stockbased compensation and • changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or other countries in which we operate  we are eligible for tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in singapore would be subject to a tax holiday andor reduced tax rates for a limited period of time under the laws of singapore our ability to realize benefits from these initiatives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met the incentives are substantially modified or if we incur losses for which we cannot take a deduction   we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or we could be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others either of which could weaken our competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets and other measures we believe that our success will depend more upon the innovation technological expertise and marketing abilities of our employees nevertheless we have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions resulting from our ongoing research and development and manufacturing activities our intellectual property portfolio has  patents and patent applications with expiration dates ranging from april  to june  in addition we have various registered trademarks and copyright registrations covering mainly applications used in the operation of our systems we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we may not be able to protect our technology adequately and competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently our pending patent applications may not be issued or us or foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights in addition litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents copyrights or other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement such litigation has resulted in and in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the outcome of the litigation patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us furthermore others may independently develop similar technology or products or if patents are issued to us design around the patents issued to us invalidation of our patents related to those technologies or the expiration of patents covering our key technologies could allow our competitors to more effectively compete against us which could result in less revenue for us we have from time to time been notified of claims that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties we believe that the outcome of these matters will not be material to our business results of operations or financial condition infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims may be asserted in the future and such assertions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the outcome of any litigation with respect to any such future claims we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights however a license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we could decide in the alternative to resort to litigation to challenge such claims such challenges could be expensive and time consuming and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the outcome of any litigation we use hazardous substances in the operation of our business and any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations or to appropriately control the use disposal or storage of such substances could subject us to significant liabilities we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to environment protection and workplace safety including the use storage discharge handling emission generation manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on us suspension of production alteration of the manufacturing process or cessation of operations such regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to comply with these regulations including any failure to control the use disposal or storage of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities our investment portfolio may suffer losses from changes in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or liquidity as of december    we had  million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in commercial paper and us governmentbacked securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity and market and interest rate risks substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one or more of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced as a result of any of the foregoing we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and  credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes our restructuring activities may not achieve the results we expect and could change which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition    in  we implemented restructuring activities to reduce expenses which included a reduction in our workforce   there can be no assurance that our restructuring activities will produce the cost savings we anticipate in the expected timeframe or that the cumulative restructuring charge will not have to increase in order to achieve our cost savings targets any delay or failure to achieve the expected cost savings and any increase in our anticipated cumulative restructuring charge would likely cause our future earnings to be lower than anticipated our equity incentive plans certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain aspects of delaware law may discourage third parties from pursuing a change of control transaction with us certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation equity incentive plans licensing agreements bylaws and delaware law may discourage certain transactions involving a change in control of our company in addition to the foregoing the shareholdings of our officers directors and persons or entities that may be deemed affiliates and the ability of the board of directors to issue “blank check” preferred stock without further stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying deferring or inhibiting us from experiencing a change in control and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of our common stock we are subject to laws regulations and similar requirements changes to which may adversely affect our business and operations we are subject to laws regulations and similar requirements that affect our business and operations including but not limited to the areas of commerce import and export control intellectual property income and other taxes antitrust anticorruption labor environmental health and safety our compliance in these areas may be costly especially in areas where there are inconsistencies between the various jurisdictions in which we operate while we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with various laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such violation or alleged violation could materially and adversely affect our business any changes or potential changes to laws regulations or similar requirements or our ability to respond to these changes may significantly increase our costs to maintain compliance or result in our decision to limit our business products or jurisdictions in which we operate any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes provisions regarding certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries these provisions require companies to undertake due diligence procedures and reports on the use of conflict minerals in its products including products manufactured by third parties compliance with these provisions will cause us to incur costs to certify that our supply chain is conflict free and we may face difficulties in complying with the law if our suppliers are unwilling or unable to verify the source of their materials our ability to source parts containing these metals and minerals may be adversely impacted in addition our customers may require that we provide them with a certification and our inability to do so may disqualify us as a supplier we hold cash and cash equivalents at various foreign subsidiaries that may not be readily available to meet domestic cash requirements our various foreign subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and as we intend to reinvest certain foreign earnings indefinitely these balances held outside the united states may not be readily available to meet our domestic cash requirements we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements purchases of property and equipment and potentially for future acquisitions if we are unable to meet our domestic cash requirements using domestic cash flows from operations or domestic cash and cash equivalents it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that we have designated as permanently reinvested we may also be required to repatriate cash held outside the united states to meet the closing condition of having not less than  million of cash on hand in the united states at the time of the closing of the merger the repatriation of earnings may require us to record additional income tax expense and remit additional taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition  item b unresolved staff comments we have no unresolved staff comments item  properties we maintain our headquarters and manufacturing operations in san jose california in a leased facility totaling approximately  square feet which contains general administration and finance marketing and sales customer service and support manufacturing and research development and engineering the lease for this facility expires in january  we also rent sales and support offices in the united states and outside the us in taiwan the philippines japan korea thailand germany and china with varying terms and expiration dates during the years ended december   and  we either extended our leases in several of these sales facilities or negotiated new terms on june   we renegotiated the august   lease for our singapore operations and entered into a new lease that will expire in june  the leased facility is approximately  square feet in march  we entered into an operating lease agreement for facilities in waltham massachusetts totaling

pursuant to which among other things merger subsidiary will be merged with and into the company with the company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of veeco subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as discussed in more detail under the heading “recent developments” on page  and in note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k beginning on page  critical accounting policies and estimates  the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements by their nature these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenues inventory valuation warranty obligations purchase order commitments bad debts deferred income taxes restructuring liabilities asset retirement obligations stock basedcompensation and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these policies with our audit committee revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we derive revenue from four sources system sales spare parts sales service contracts and license fees   provided all other criteria are met we recognize revenues on system sales when system acceptance provisions have been met in accordance with the terms and conditions of the arrangement in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing system acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or system acceptance whichever occurs first in these instances which are infrequent revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist   our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements in transactions with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements and when system acceptance has occurred or we are otherwise released from our system acceptance obligations   for multiple element arrangements the total consideration for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on i vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if available ii third party evidence of selling price if vsoe is not available or iii an estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available if we have not established vsoe and cannot obtain third party evidence of selling price we determine our estimate of the relative selling price by considering our production costs and historical margins of similar products or services we believe this best represents the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we regularly review the method used to determine our relative selling price and update any estimates accordingly we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or other future performance obligations   we generally recognize revenue from spare parts sales upon shipment as our products are generally sold on terms that transfer title and risk of ownership when it leaves our site we sell service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period for timebased service contracts or as service hours are delivered for contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours we recognize license revenue from transactions in which our systems are resold by our customers to third parties as well as from royalty arrangements   costs related to deferred product revenues are capitalized deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition deferred product revenue and costs are netted on our balance sheet under the caption “deferred product and services income” the gross amount of deferred revenues and deferred costs at december   were  million and  million  respectively as compared to  million and  million  respectively at december    costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales inventories and purchase order commitments  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of among other factors demand requirements and market conditions based on this analysis we may record adjustments to the value of our inventory although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand product mix or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results in the future if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be reserved we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination warranty obligations we recognize the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected should actual product failure rates material usage rates and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could result in future charges or credits to our gross profit we believe our warranty accrual as of december    will be sufficient to satisfy outstanding obligations as of that date      allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this reserve is established based upon historical trends current economic conditions delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate or even a single customer was otherwise unable to make payments additional allowances may be required the typical selling price of our systems is between  million and  million accordingly a single customer default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our bad debt reserve for accounts receivable was  million at december   and   intangible assets purchased technology patents and other intangible assets are presented at cost net of accumulated amortization and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value stockbased compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation—stock compensation “asc ” sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating our stock price volatility employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense recognized in our results of operations could be materially affected as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures asc  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements asc topic  income taxes “asc ” provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such deferred tax assets is more likely than not to occur realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax  jurisdictions to obtain the benefit of the reversal of temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards each quarter we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets we consider available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance as a result of our analysis we concluded that it is more likely than not that as of december   our net deferred tax assets will not be realized with the exception of those in japan and taiwan therefore we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets outside of japan and taiwan we continue to monitor the relative weight of positive and negative evidence of future profitability in relevant jurisdictions however as of december   we have determined that the following negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence such that it is not more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to utilize our deferred tax assets and release the associated valuation allowance • movement of certain product manufacturing to singapore resulting in us taxable losses • cumulative three year us taxable loss • inherent earnings volatility of our industry resulting in our inability to forecast long term earnings and • usage limitations resulting in a longer period being required to realize our deferred tax assets as of december    we had recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  million against our net deferred tax assets except for those in japan and taiwan as of december    we had recorded approximately  million of net foreign deferred tax assets related to our operations in japan and taiwan based on projected future pretax income in japan and taiwan these assets were not subject to a valuation allowance as it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future impact of recently issued accounting standards      in may  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the us resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under us gaap under the new model recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers on july   the fasb agreed to delay the effective date by one year as currently issued and amended and in accordance with the agreed upon delay the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of the standard the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application while we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard we currently believe the most significant impact will likely relate to systems revenue under the new standard we are evaluating whether our systems revenue would be recognized on shipment we are planning to adopt the standard on january   we plan to adopt the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective approach in february  the fasb issued asu  “leases” topic  which supersedes topic  leases the update requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets the new standard is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal year  on a modified retrospective basis and earlier adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu  on our condensed consolidated financial statements in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation  stock compensation” topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the update involves several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows it is effective for annual periods beginning after december   while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard we currently believe it will not have a significant impact on our income tax provision classification of awards or statement of cash flows results of operations we derive a substantial portion of our total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems which typically range in price from  million to  million as a result of the larger sale prices the timing and recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for any particular period  our backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve our sales objectives for that period in addition orders in backlog are subject to cancellation shipment or system acceptance delays and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties consequently our net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon our obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received our business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and system acceptance during that period furthermore a substantial portion of our shipments has historically occurred near the end of each quarter delays in installation and system acceptance due for example to our inability to successfully demonstrate the agreedupon specifications or criteria at the customer’s facility or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations which may materially adversely affect our operating results for that period this risk is especially applicable in connection with the introduction and initial sales of a new product line or as a result of industry trends impacting our foundry customers including a shift toward semiconductors utilizing new technology transistor architecture additionally the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due for example to rescheduling delays deferrals or cancellations by customers additional customer configuration requirements or to unexpected manufacturing or performance difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or quality issues with components sourced from suppliers have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations and for our operating results to vary from period to period materially adversely affecting our operating results for that period in particular the long manufacturing and acceptance cycles of our advanced packaging family of wafer steppers laser thermal processing and inspection systems and the long lead time for lenses and other materials could cause shipments and acceptances of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter additionally the need for continued expenditures for research and development capital equipment ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support among other factors will make it difficult for us to reduce our operating expenses in a particular period if we fail to achieve our net sales goals for the period sales summary            international sales

upgrades spare parts sales services and licensing of technologies for the year ended december    system sales accounted for approximately  of total net sales sales of spare parts services and licenses accounted for the remaining  of total net sales  system sales increased  to  million primarily attributable to an increase in lithography inspection and laser thermal processing system sales partially offset by a decrease in system upgrades and nanotechnology sales in   as compared to   on a product market application basis system sales to the semiconductor industry were  million for the year ended december    an increase of  as compared to  million in   this increase was primarily due to more system units sold semiconductor industry sales consist of sales to the advanced packaging market semiconductor and semiconductor inspection market system sales to the semiconductor industry are highly dependent on customer capacity demand system sales to the nanotechnology market were  million for the year ended december    a  decrease as compared with  million in   the decrease in sales to the nanotechnology market was primarily due to a decrease in hbled system sales partially offset by an increase in ald system sales system sales to the nanotechnology market are highly dependent on capacity demand in the industries we serve including hbleds ald thin film heads automotive mems ledlaser diodes and ink jet print heads we therefore expect to experience significant variations in sales within this market from period to period sales of spare parts for the year ended december   increased  to  million  as compared to  million in   the increase in sales of spare parts was the result of an increase in spare parts demand services revenue decreased  to  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million in   the decrease in services revenue was the result of a decrease in the number of service contracts revenues from licensing activities for the year ended december    increased  to  million as compared to  million in   pursuant to our license arrangements such transactions are subject to a license fee based on units sold future revenues from licensing activities if any will be contingent upon existing and future licensing arrangements we may not be successful in generating licensing revenues and do not anticipate the recognition of significant levels of licensing income in the future for the year ended december    international net sales were  million  or  of total net sales as compared with  million  or  of total net sales in   for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding  period sales to greater china increased by  million and sales to korea increased by  million partially offset by i a decrease in sales to japan of  million ii a decrease in sales to the rest of the world of  million and iii a decrease in sales to europe of  million we expect sales to international customers to continue to represent a significant amount of our future revenues as our customer base in asia continues to expand its capacity our revenue derived from sales in foreign countries is not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations principally because sales contracts for our systems are generally denominated in us dollars however we do sell systems and spare parts into japan and this subjects us to the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations since the orders are often denominated in japanese yen we attempt to mitigate this risk by entering into monthly foreign currency forward exchange contracts as balance sheet derivatives which includes a portion of our receivables that are denominated in japanese yen from parts sales for system sales we attempt to mitigate foreign currency risk by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less as cash flow derivatives we had approximately  million of japanese yendenominated receivables at december    international sales expose us to a number of additional risks including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar which impact the relative cost of ownership of our products and thus the customer’s willingness to purchase our product see “risk factors  a substantial portion of our sales are outside of the united states which subjects us to risks related to customer service installation foreign economic and political stability uncertain regulatory and tax rules and foreign exchange rate fluctuations all of which make it more difficult to operate our business”  vs  for the year ended december   system sales accounted for approximately  of total net sales sales of spare parts services and licenses accounted for the remaining  of total net sales

margin was due to an increase of  resulting from manufacturing efficiencies created by greater production volume and a  increase due to improved service utilization partially offset by a  decrease in gross margin resulting from higher material cost due to product mix our gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the introduction of new products which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and which are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance the mix of products sold the rate of capacity utilization writedown of inventory and open purchase commitments product discounts pricing and competition in our targeted markets and nonlinearity of shipments during the period that can result in manufacturing inefficiencies  vs  gross margins were  and  for  and  respectively the  increase

activities as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   were  compared to  for  the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as compared to  restructuring expenses in millions           vs     vs  restructuring expenses  —        —        of revenue —        —          during the year ended december   there were no restructuring efforts however during the year ended december   we made reductions in our workforce as part of our efforts to remain competitive in the current environment  the restructuring costs totaled  million and were related to severance and benefits for headcount reductions in certain functions in the us and certain foreign countries  interest and other income net  in millions        interest income           other income expense net          interest and other income net           interest and other income net was  million for the year ended december    as compared with  million and  million for  and   respectively we recorded  million of interest income during the year ended december    the  million increase was primarily due to higher returns on the shortterm investments balance during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   interest and other income net was  million as compared with  million for  we recorded  million of interest income during the year ended december   the  million increase was primarily due to higher returns on the shortterm investments balance during the year ended december   as compared to  we presently maintain an investment portfolio with a weightedaverage maturity of less than one year consequently changes in shortterm interest rates have a significant impact on our interest income future changes in shortterm interest rates are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our interest income other expense net of  million for the year ended december   was primarily the result of  million of losses from foreign currency movements in   other income net of  million  was primarily the result of  million of losses from foreign currency movements partially offset by  million in miscellaneous other income in   other expense net of  million was the result of  million in miscellaneous other income partially offset by  million of losses from foreign currency movements provision for income taxes for the year ended december    we recorded income tax benefit of  million as compared to an income tax expense of  million and an income tax expense of  million  respectively in  and   the income tax benefit recorded in  resulted primarily from the reversal of previously accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations partially offset by tax expense recorded from foreign jurisdictions the income tax expense recorded in  and  resulted primarily from foreign taxes for the year ended december   the actual tax benefit recorded differs from the federal tax rate of  primarily due to the reversal of accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and the fact that the us taxable loss was not realized due to a valuation allowance  the actual income tax expense recorded for the years ended  and  differs from the federal tax rate of  primarily due to current tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and the fact that in both  and  the us taxable loss was not realized due to a valuation allowance we are eligible for tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in singapore is subject to a tax holiday andor reduced tax rates for a limited period of time under the laws of singapore to realize these benefits we must meet certain requirements relating to employment and investment activities this exemption is expected to expire within four years in  the tax benefit attributable to the tax holiday was approximately  million with a  impact on earnings per share in  the tax benefit attributable to the tax holiday was approximately  million with a  impact on diluted earnings per share in  the tax benefit attributable to the tax holiday was approximately  million with a  impact on diluted earnings per share our ability to realize benefits from these initiatives could be materially adversely affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met the incentives are substantially modified or if we incur losses for which we cannot take a deduction        income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how when and if cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters and we do not anticipate any material earnings impact from their ultimate resolutions in accordance with asc  we had unrecognized benefits of  million as of december   due to uncertain tax positions we continue to recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax provision and accrued an insignificant amount for these items for the year during the year ended december    the balance related to uncertain tax positions decreased by  million net as discussed above if we are able to eventually recognize these uncertain tax positions  million of the unrecognized benefit on december    would reduce our effective tax rate we currently  have a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future each quarter we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets we consider available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance as a result of our analysis and as further described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section deferred income taxes we concluded that it is more likely than not that as of december   our net deferred tax assets will not be realized with the exception of those in japan and taiwan therefore we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets outside of japan and taiwan it is possible that sometime in the next  months the positive evidence will be sufficient to release a material amount of our valuation allowance however there is no assurance that this will occur we are subject to federal and state tax examination for years  forward and  forward respectively by virtue of the tax attributes carrying forward from those years we are also subject to audits in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate for years  and forward there are no material income tax examinations currently in progress outlook the anticipated timing of orders shipments and system acceptances usually requires that we fill a number of production slots in any given period in order to meet our sales targets if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to secure those production orders or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted additionally we may not exceed or even maintain our current or prior levels of net sales for any period in the future for the reasons enumerated in this report we believe that the market acceptance and volume production of our advanced packaging systems laser processing systems and inspection systems are of critical importance to our future financial results at december   these systems represented approximately  of our backlog liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the year ended december    as compared with  million for the comparable period in   net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december   was attributable to  million of cash generated from operations after adjustments for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization of intangibles and others partially offset by  million of working capital cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities as described below working capital uses of cash of  million were due to i a  million increase in accounts receivables ii a  million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets iii a  million decrease in other liabilities and iv a  million decrease in deferred product and service income working capital sources of cash of  million were due to a a  million decrease in inventory b a  million increase in accounts payable and c a  million increase in accrued expenses we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain systems particularly newer products our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital currently we are devoting significant resources to the development introduction and commercialization of our laser thermal processing systems and inspection systems and to the development of our next generation x lithography technologies we intend to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research development and engineering manufacturing and selling general and administrative costs in order to further develop produce and support these new products there can be no assurance that any expenditures to develop these products will result in improved sales or that markets for these products will become viable additionally gross profit margins inventory and capital equipment levels may be adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of the laser thermal processing systems inspection systems and by future generations of our x wafer steppers these costs include but are not limited to additional manufacturing overhead costs of demonstration systems and facilities and the establishment of additional aftersales support organizations additionally there can be no assurance that operating expenses will not increase relative to sales as a result of adding technical marketing and administrative personnel among other costs to support our new products if we are unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if our sales fall below expectations our cash flow and operating results will be materially adversely affected until among other factors costs and expenses can be reduced our failure to achieve our sales targets for these new products could result in additional inventory writeoffs and asset impairment charges either of which could materially adversely impact our results of operations  during the year ended december    net cash provided by investing activities was  million  as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of  million for the comparable period in   net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december   was attributable to maturities of availableforsale investment securities of   million  net of purchases partially offset by capital expenditures of  million  net cash used in financing activities was  million during the year ended december    as compared with net cash used in financing activities of  million for the comparable period in   net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december   was primarily attributable to i the net payment of notes payable of  million ii tax payments for the release of restricted stock units of  million partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stockbased compensation plans of  million net historically our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by our operations at december    we had working capital of  million  at december    our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments net of related borrowings under our line of credit was  million  at december    million of our cash cash equivalents and investments was held by foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the united states we currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the united states as we believe our cash flows provided by our us operations will meet our future us liquidity needs in december  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a brokerage firm replacing a similar arrangement that we had with a different firm under the terms of this agreement we may borrow funds at a cost equal to the current federal funds rate plus  basis points ie  as of december    certain of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments secure outstanding borrowings under this facility we may borrow up to  of our total cash cash equivalents and investments balance in this brokerage account funds are advanced to us under this facility based on predetermined advance rates on the cash and securities held by us in this brokerage account this agreement has no set expiration date and there are no loan covenants as of december   and   balances of  million and  million  respectively were outstanding under this facility with a related collateral requirement of approximately  million of our cash cash equivalents and investments      the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december    and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions total   less than  year    years    years   after   years notes payable obligations          —    —    — noncancelable capital lease obligations       —   —   — noncancelable operating lease obligations              longterm payables    —      —    asset retirement obligations    —      —   — open purchase order commitments       —   —   — total contractual cash obligations                   the amounts shown in the table above for open purchase order commitments are primarily related to the purchase of inventories equipment and leasehold improvements we record charges to operations for purchase order commitments we deem in excess of normal operating requirements see “critical accounting policies and estimates” the development and manufacture of new systems and enhancements are highly capitalintensive in order to be competitive we believe we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment sales service training and support capabilities systems procedures and controls and expansion of operations and research and development among many other items we expect that cash generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months however in the nearterm we may continue to utilize existing and future lines of credit and other sources of financing in order to maintain our present levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments beyond the next twelve months we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital or capital equipment needs in addition we may seek to raise equity or debt capital at any time that we deem market conditions to be favorable additional financing if needed may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses future acquisitions may require the use of substantial amounts of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the issuance of potentially dilutive equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies personnel and products of the acquired companies the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company in the event we acquire product lines technologies or businesses which do not complement our business or which otherwise do not enhance our sales or operating results we may incur substantial writeoffs and higher recurring operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event that any such acquisition does occur there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on our business or operating results offbalance sheet transactions our offbalance sheet transactions consist of certain financial guarantees both expressed and implied related to indemnification for product liability patent infringement and latent product defects other than liabilities recorded pursuant to known product defects at december    we did not record a liability associated with these guarantees as we have little or no history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements see note  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information foreign currency as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we attempt to hedge most of our japanese yendenominated foreign currency exposures we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that outstanding japanese yendenominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges to offset substantial portions of the potential gains or losses associated with our japanese yendenominated assets and liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december   and   we maintain an investment policy designed to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default certain of our cash cash equivalents and investments serve as collateral for a line of credit we maintain with a brokerage firm the line of credit is used for liquidity purposes mitigating the need to liquidate investments in order to meet our current operating cash requirements      the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates these instruments are comprised of cash equivalents and investments these instruments are held for purposes other than trading the modeling techniques used to measure the change in fair

did not materially alter our investment objectives or criteria and believe that although the composition of our portfolio has changed from the preceding year the portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same credit risk we mitigate credit default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and is diversified in accordance with our investment policy to date we have not experienced significant liquidity problems with our portfolio our single largest holding at december    excluding the us government and its agencies was a  million money market fund as of december    we did not have any investments in mortgage backed or auction rate securities however we intend to closely monitor developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary or advisable based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment foreign exchange risk the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however we do enter into these transactions in other currencies primarily japanese yen to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established cash flow and balance sheet hedging programs  we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that outstanding japanese yendenominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates our hedging programs reduce but do

defined by accounting standard codification “asc” topic  through march    which is the issuance date of our financial statements use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements by their nature these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventory valuation and purchase order commitments warranty obligations asset retirement obligations bad debts estimated useful lives of fixed assets intangible assets asset impairment income taxes deferred income tax valuation allowance stockbased compensation and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other analyses and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  summary of significant accounting policies cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity date at acquisition of three months or less the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value investments management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each balance sheet date at december   and   all investments and cash equivalents in our portfolio were classified as “availableforsale” and are stated at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity the fair value of shortterm investments are estimated based on quoted prices in active markets or significant other observable inputs as of december   and   the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity such amortization as well as interest dividends realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included in interest and other income net the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectability this reserve is established based upon historical trends current economic conditions delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards we perform a detailed  assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of among other factors demand requirements and market conditions based on this analysis we may record adjustments to the value of our inventory during the years ended december   and  we have recorded zero in reserves and recorded no charges for excess and obsolete inventories and open purchase order commitments longlived assets equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization equipment is depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives ie three to nine  years leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the life of the related assets or the lease term whichever is shorter depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december     and  was  million   million and  million  respectively we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable we assess these assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these assets no asset impairment charges have been recorded during the years ended december     and  intangible assets purchased technology patents and other intangible assets are presented at cost net of accumulated amortization and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method amortization expense for each of the years ended december     and  was  million  we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value no intangible assets impairment charges have been recorded during the years ended december     and  derivative instruments and hedging the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however we also enter into these transactions in other currencies primarily japanese yen our policy is to minimize foreign currency denominated transaction and remeasurement exposures with derivative instruments mainly forward contracts the gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to at least partially offset the transaction and remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative purposes under asc topic  derivatives and hedging “asc ” all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value the gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting the fair value of derivative instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheets is as follows         fair value as of in thousands   balance sheets location   december     december   foreign exchange contracts   other current assets             other current liabilities           total derivatives        —     our derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms market risk is the potential change in an investment’s value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates credit spreads or other variables we monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and do not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be material credit and market risks as a result of an offset by the underlying cash flow being hedged related to derivative instruments were not considered material at december   and   cash flow hedging  we designate and document as cash flow hedges foreign exchange forward contracts that are used by us to hedge the risk that forecasted revenue may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss “oci” until the period in which the forecasted sale being hedged is recognized at which time the amount in oci is reclassified to earnings as a component of revenue to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be effective in offsetting the change in the value of the forecasted sales being hedged the ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately recognized in income as a component of interest and other income net we calculate hedge effectiveness at a minimum each fiscal quarter we measure hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the spot rate of the derivative with the cumulative change in the spot rate of the anticipated sales transactions the maturity of these instruments is generally nine months or less we record any excluded components of the hedge in interest and other income net in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur within the designated hedge period or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from oci to interest and other income net on the consolidated statement of operations at december   we had two currency forward contracts for the sale of japanese yen of  million  at december   we had one currency forward contract for the sale of japanese yen of  million  during the year ended december   and  we reclassified into earnings an accumulated loss of   million and   million  respectively that was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss balance sheet derivatives we manage the foreign currency risk associated with yendenominated assets and liabilities using foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities of less than nine months the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognized as a component of interest and other income net and is intended to offset the remeasurement gains and losses associated with the nonfunctional currency denominated assets and liabilities at december   and   we had currency sellforward contracts classified as fair value hedges for the sale of japanese yen of  million and  million  respectively at december   and   we had buyforward contracts for the purchase of japanese yen of  million and  million  respectively the fair value of derivatives at december   and  was insignificant the following sets forth the effect of the derivative instruments on

expense net        revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we derive revenue from four sources system sales spare parts sales service contracts and license fees   provided all other criteria are met we recognize revenues on system sales when system acceptance provisions have been met in accordance with the terms and conditions of the arrangement in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing system acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or system acceptance whichever occurs first in these instances which are infrequent revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist   our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements in transactions with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements and when system acceptance has occurred or we are otherwise released from our system acceptance obligations     for multiple element arrangements the total consideration for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on i vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if available ii third party evidence of selling price if vsoe is not available or iii an estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available if we have not established vsoe and cannot obtain third party evidence of selling price we determine our estimate of the relative selling price by considering our production costs and historical margins of similar products or services we believe this best represents the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we regularly review the method used to determine our relative selling price and update any estimates accordingly we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or other future performance obligations    we generally recognize revenue from spare parts sales upon shipment as our products are generally sold on terms that transfer title and risk of ownership when it leaves our site we sell service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period for timebased service contracts or as service hours are delivered for contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours we recognize license revenue from transactions in which our systems are resold by our customers to third parties as well as from royalty arrangements   costs related to deferred product revenues are capitalized deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition deferred product revenue and costs are netted on our balance sheet under the caption “deferred product and services income” the gross amount of deferred revenues and deferred costs at december   was  million and  million  respectively the gross amount of deferred revenues and deferred costs at december   was  million and  million  respectively costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales warranty accrual we generally warrant our products for material and labor to repair the product for a period of  months for new products or three months for refurbished products from the date of system acceptance accordingly an accrual for the estimated cost of the warranty is recorded at the time the product is shipped and the related charge is recorded in the statement of operations at the time revenue is recognized      research development and engineering expenses we are actively engaged in basic technology and applied research programs designed to develop new products and product applications in addition substantial ongoing product and process improvement engineering and support programs relating to existing products are conducted within engineering departments and elsewhere research development and engineering costs are charged to operations as

subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements asc topic  income taxes “asc ” provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such deferred tax assets is more likely than not to occur realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain the benefit of the reversal of temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed with the exception of certain international jurisdictions ie japan and taiwan we have  determined that at this time it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets attributable to the remaining jurisdictions will not be realized primarily due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before they expire based on the fact that it is more likely than not we will not generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions accordingly we have established a valuation allowance for such deferred tax assets management continues to monitor the relative weight of positive and negative evidence of future profitability in relevant jurisdictions see note  income taxes for further details taxes collected from customers we collect taxes from our customers for sales transactions as assessed by respective governmental authorities on our consolidated statements of operations these taxes are presented on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses impact of recently issued accounting standards      in may  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the us resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under us gaap under the new model recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers on july   the fasb agreed to delay the effective date by one year as currently issued and amended and in accordance with the agreed upon delay the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of the standard the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application while we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard we currently believe the most significant impact will likely relate to systems revenue under the new standard we are evaluating whether our systems revenue would be recognized on shipment we are planning to adopt the standard on january   we plan to adopt the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective approach in february  the fasb issued asu  “leases” topic  which supersedes topic  leases the update requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets the new standard is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal  on a modified retrospective basis and earlier adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu  on our condensed consolidated financial statements in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation  stock compensation” topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the update involves several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows it is

blackscholes valuation input for expected volatility used for our stock options for all years presented was based on the historical volatility of our common stock the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a us treasury zerocoupon issue with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option the dividend yield reflects that we have not paid any cash dividends since

and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the adoption of this deferred portion of asc  did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position fair value is defined under asc  as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc  must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs asc  describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable that may be used to measure fair value which are the following • level —quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets • level —quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets • level —model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including availableforsale securities and foreign currency derivatives

business we transitioned certain manufacturing processes to singapore thereby bringing these activities closer to our asiabased customers we have qualified for tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in singapore is subject to a tax holiday andor reduced tax rates for a limited period of time under the laws of singapore to realize these benefits we must meet certain requirements relating to employment and investment activities this exemption is expected to expire within four years in  the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was approximately  million with a  impact on diluted earnings per share in  the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was approximately  million with a  impact on diluted earnings per share in  the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was approximately  million with a  impact on diluted earnings per share our ability to realize benefits from these initiatives could be materially adversely affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met the incentives are substantially modified or if we incur losses for which we cannot take a deduction            significant components of deferred income tax assets and

        we have not provided for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december   because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the united states given that we have moved certain manufacturing processes to singapore and that our future us cash flows are expected to meet our future us cash needs as of december   the cumulative amount of earnings for which us income taxes have not been provided is approximately  million  determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable we currently have a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax asset each quarter we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets as a result of our analysis we concluded that it is more likely than not that as of december   our net deferred tax assets will not be realized with the exception of those in japan and taiwan therefore we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets outside of japan and taiwan management continues to monitor the relative weight of positive and negative evidence of future profitability in relevant jurisdictions however as of december   we have determined that the following negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence such that it is not more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to utilize our deferred tax assets and release the associated valuation allowance • movement of certain product manufacturing to singapore resulting in us taxable losses • cumulative three years us taxable loss • inherent earnings volatility of our industry resulting in our inability to forecast long term earnings and • usage limitations resulting in a longer period being required to realize our deferred tax assets the net valuation allowance increased by  million during the year ended december    and increased by  million and  million during the years ended december   and   respectively the increase in valuation allowance in  was primarily due to an increase in net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards approximately  million of the valuation allowance as of december   is attributable to pre windfall stock option deductions the benefit of which will be credited to paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable beginning in  we are tracking the windfall stock option deductions off balance sheet as required by asc  as of december    we have a previously recorded balance of  million of windfall stock option deductions that are being tracked off balance sheet if and when realized a tax benefit of  million associated with those deductions will be credited to additional paidin capital in  no entry to paidin capital was made to reflect the benefit from windfall stock option deductions which is the excess of federal income tax liabilities expected on the tax return without windfall stock option deductions over federal income tax liabilities expected on the tax return with windfall stock option deductions because we are in a loss position in this year prior to  a tax benefit of  million associated with those deductions had been credited to additional paidin capital  as of december    we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california tax purposes of  million and  million  respectively we also had federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  million and  million  respectively the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  through   if not utilized the federal tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  through   if not utilized the california tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change as defined by the irs code section  that occurred in  none of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards is anticipated to expire as a result of the ownership change any future changes of ownership could result in the expiration of net operating losses or credits before utilization during the year ended december    our reserve for uncertain tax positions decreased by  million  primarily due to the release of  million of a federal tax reserve where the statute of limitations had lapsed interest and penalties related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions were insignificant in  and  if we are able to eventually recognize these uncertain tax positions  million of the unrecognized benefit on january   and  million of the unrecognized benefit on december    would reduce our effective tax rate we currently have a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future we are subject to federal and state tax examination for years  forward and  forward respectively by virtue of the tax attributes carrying forward from those years we are also subject to audits in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate for years  and forward there are no income
