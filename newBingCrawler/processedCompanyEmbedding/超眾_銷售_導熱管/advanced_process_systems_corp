navigation search advanced manufacturing is the use of innovative technology to improve products or processes contents  use of technology to improve products and processes  product technologies  process technologies  use of businessmanagement methodologies  other definitions  traditional vs advanced manufacturers  successful manufacturers  research and development  dynamic constantly changing  conclusion  references use of technology to improve products and processesedit one of the most widely used definitions of advanced manufacturing involves the use of technology to improve products andor processes with the relevant technology being described as advanced innovative or cutting edge for example one organization defines advanced manufacturing as industries that increasingly integrate new innovative technologies in both products and processes the rate of technology adoption and the ability to use that technology to remain competitive and add value define the advanced manufacturing sector another author defined world class foundry read manufacturing asa world class manufacturing wcm is one which integrates the latestgen machinery with process work systems to facilitate manufacturing based business development governed around manufactured  products only duly based over a high accent on product substitution or new product development advanced manufacturing centers upon improving the performance of us industry through the innovative application of technologies processes and methods to product design and production finally a recent survey of advanced manufacturing definitions by the white house and states a concise definition of advanced manufacturing offered by some is manufacturing that entails rapid transfer of science and technology st into manufacturing products and processes pcast april  product technologiesedit any organization practicing advanced manufacturing shall produce products characterised as products with high levels of design technologically complex products innovative products reliable affordable and available products newer better more exciting products products that solve a variety of societys problems process technologiesedit the manufacturing process technologies described in definitions of advanced manufacturing include computer technologies eg cad cae cam paul fowler nacfam uk manufacturing advisory service southeast cb adams st louis oecd high performance computing hpc for modeling simulation and analysis council on competitiveness rapid prototyping additive manufacturing high precision technologies paul fowler nacfam information technologies paul fowler nacfam advanced robotics and other intelligent production systems us department of labor eta cb adams st louis automation uk

department of labor new industrial platform technologies eg composite materials uk manufacturing advisory service southeast ability to custom manufacture pcast paul fowler nacfam grow oklahoma campaign ability to manufacture high or low volume scalability pcast paul fowler nacfam grow oklahoma campaign high rate of manufacturing use of businessmanagement methodologiesedit a number of organizations also included business or management methodologies in their definition of advanced manufacturing for example one organization defines advanced manufacturing as the insertion of new technology improved processes and management methods to improve the manufacturing of products national defense university  as reported in pcast another organization lists advanced manufacturing as encompassing lean production techniques enhanced supply chain integration and technology assimilation in fact the wikipedia definition of advanced manufacturing is advanced planning and scheduling described as a manufacturing management process by which raw materials and production capacity are optimally allocated to meet demand overall the following business or management methodologies were listed as being a part of advanced manufacturing quality controls us department of labor lean production technologies supply chain integration advanced planning and scheduling wikipedia online accessed june  other definitionsedit there are also definitions of advanced manufacturing that are used by one or few sources traditional vs advanced manufacturersedit traditional manufacturing is defined as the act of converting raw materials into finished products by using manual or mechanized transformational techniques the purpose of such activities is to add value to achieve targeted objectives which do not preclude societys overall interests in one report the distinction between traditional sectors of manufacturing listed as auto steel and others listed as aerospace medical device pharmaceutical is the basis for a definition of advanced manufacturing with the characteristics of the two differing in terms of volume and scale economies labor and skill content and the depth and diversity of the network surrounding the industry new england council and deloitte as referenced in pcast document successful manufacturersedit other sources define advanced manufacturers as those that succeed in todays competitive environment one source states that what differentiates certain companies is a unique ability to create a competitive advantage in this environment these manufacturers think and do faster and by definition these advantages make them advanced industrial college of the armed forces the white house survey lists some experts as defining advanced manufacturing solely by advances that led to decreased cost or increased productivity pcast research and developmentedit one organization listed aggressive research and development as being part of the definition of advanced manufacturing purdue university although research and development was not explicitly included in most definitions the innovative technologies listed by many are most likely the result of extensive research and development development of a sound product which satisfies given criteria with least pain is a common challenge most unusually haunting the manufacturer the domain of competition is quite large because manufacturers compete at intermanufacturing and intrafirm levels producing near net products the customer desires a component which promises functions most reliably while addressing sociotechnoenvironmental attributes  dynamic constantly changingedit finally several sources pointed out that any definition of advanced manufacturing will need to change with the changing times and that the definition will vary for different companies and different industries the white house survey states most discussants agree that an appropriate advanced manufacturing definition should be dynamic in nature and be treated as more of a benchmark that is there is a constant iteration of improving manufacturing frontierstherefore what is classified as frontier is constantly changing and likewise advanced manufacturing is constantly changing pcast another source stated that advanced manufacturing is like a chameleon it changes in response to the needs of whichever company has incorporated it into its manufacturing process st louis cb adams a final expert is quoted as saying advanced manufacturing by its very nature defies definition because it is going to be different for the chemical industry than it is for the metal fabrication industry and any other industry tom white as quoted by cb adams conclusionedit the term advanced manufacturing encompasses many of the developments in the manufacturing field during the late th and early st centuries including high tech products and processes and clean green and flexible manufacturing among others no one definition captures everything said about advanced manufacturing although the majority of definitions found on the web include the use of innovative technology to improve products andor processes and many also include the use of new businessmanagement methodologies accordingly the definition that probably comes closest to being comprehensive is that given by paul fowler of the national association of advanced manufacturing nacfam celebrating its th anniversary this year the advanced manufacturing entity makes extensive use of computer high precision and information technologies integrated with a high performance workforce in a production system capable of furnishing a heterogeneous mix of products in small or large volumes with both the efficiency of mass production and the flexibility of custom manufacturing in order to respond quickly to customer demands quoted in pcast in foreseeable future categorical developments facilitated with integration with computers will  be largely impacted by state of raw material and energy availability referencesedit  virginia beach economic development department
