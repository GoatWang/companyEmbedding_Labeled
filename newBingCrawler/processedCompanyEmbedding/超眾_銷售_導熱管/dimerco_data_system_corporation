httpcwefcwcomtwsummer dimerco takes a dynamic approach to oversize freight project dimerco has demonstrated its flexibility and creative thinking to pull off a major freight project transporting oversized cargo for a leading utility provider based in the middle east dimerco used its connections to minimize freight size and decrease the total cost of logistics to deliver shipments of pipe spools destined for the water security mega reservoirs project achieving a cost saving on ocean freight around  the first step was subcontracting with a packing company to solve the issue of boxing up pipe spools of differing sizes into  wooden cases with a total weight of kgs and size of cbm the cargo was then secured in the containers by a specialist lashing and tally company and delivered to the container yard having negotiated space guarantee with empty space supplement on ’ super rack sr containers which are larger and scarcer than ’ flat rack fr containers dimerco split the cargo between  shipping lines with different targeted schedules in order to meet the customer’s budgets once loaded the vessels followed a route from south korea to middle east at every stage the carrier’s status and schedule had to be minutely monitored to ensure success for the end customer executing this highly complex cargo project relied heavily on dimerco’s expertise long termrelationships with carriers and extensive planning to achieve the aim of fewer containers filled to maximum capacity by layering between  and  pipe spools in each of the packing cases all logistics were carefully mapped taking account of the location of the warehouses and terminals ensuring their close proximity to the trucking carriers the end result was the delivery of the project on time and within budget and a very happy customer commenting on its dynamic approach to the project mr eric roh ocean freight director of dimerco express korea corp said “our mission is to achieve results for our customers using our professionalism teamwork and flexibility to respond to and solve any arising issues our considerable experience in logistics planning enables us to make smart decisions such as opting for a container carrier rather than a bulk handling vessel as the former has a more regular schedule and guarantees to deliver the consignment on time “as well as being keen negotiators and securing optimum freight costs we were also able to make additional savings by selecting ’ sr over ’ fr we always look to improve our services and are fully aware of the growth of the crossborder freight train route but know that for shipments to middle east the container ship option is still the best” successfully handled one more significant project dimerco has again proved its vision to “be the most competitive global transportation  logistics service provider integrator and consultant” photo caption dimerco studied and coordinated to pick up cargo from customers factory in busan south korea photo caption dimerco
