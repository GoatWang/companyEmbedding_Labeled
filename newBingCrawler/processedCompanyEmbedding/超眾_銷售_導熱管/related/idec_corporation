upload or download or for monitoring by a pc rj rsc rs serial port the microsmart plc has a built in rj serial port selectable by the user for either rsc or rs communications a plugin cartridge adds an additional rscrs port the serial port supports the modbus user and rtu protocols replaceable battery the microsmart plc’s battery can be easily replaced warning of low battery level is provided both at the cpu via an led and through a special data register which can be used to trigger an alarm on the hmi or send an email alert digital and analog cartridges solution each analog cartridge has two analog io points either two inputs or outputs whereas digital cartridge has four inputs or outputs this makes the microsmart fca an ideal solution for applications requiring minimal digital or
