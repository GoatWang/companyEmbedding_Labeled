deltasprayline – innovative technology for highest productivity spray dampening units are an important part of web offset printing presses and have a strong impact on the quality of the printing result the innovative and reliable technology of the modular deltaspray helps printers achieve consistant printing quality and high process stability individual activation of each spray nozzle and automatic shutters allow great flexibility of the system configuration and give full control over the spray patterns and dampening – independent of paper widths the unique nozzle cleaning concept does not need an additional power supply and reliably prevents the nozzles from clogging this maximizes machine availability and clearly cuts down maintenance and repairs together with a specially designed dampening solution circulator a complete system is created to optimise the functionality of the dampening units advantages at a glance dampening solution is transferred without contact at a high and controlled spraying frequency individual activation of each spray nozzle for highest dosing accuracy increased press availability thanks to unique and lowmaintenance nozzle cleaning concept easy and

increasing modern presses reach output of  sheets per hour this also changes the requirements for the machines peripheral equipment the dampening solution circulation ink unit temperature control dryer blast feed and vacuum supply must perform better but also generate significantly more waste heat aircooled equipment usually simply discharges this heat into the nearest surroundings this releases energy that has great impact on relative humidity and the air temperature and makes maintaining stable production conditions significantly more difficult central water cooling works against these effects it channels all heat and energy that remains in the press room environment without impact and thereby supports a high level of process stability advantages at a glance low and easily controllable air temperature in the printing room no overload of existing ventilation and air conditioning systems lower air velocity in the press room resulting in less distributed dust reduced

has been a renowned system supplier of cooling and fluid technology for the printing industry for several decades the company is also active in the digital printing area offering its solutions from the planning phase up to the commissioning of the systems this also includes separate or secondary processes eg the cooling of a folding unit or the separation of toner and oil a special highlight is the presentation of the smartchiller this product series is used for the efficient cooling of digital printing presses for the lower to medium power range thereby increasing the profit of the users systems for uv printingtechnotrans will also present unique cooling modules for applications involving highly reactive uv inks the reliable and efficient cooling of the uv led dryers guarantees a long service life and consistent results another system for highly reactive uv inks which will be presented to the visitors of the drupa stand is an ink supply system with a patented piston sealing system along with the ink agitators of the inkmate series sustainable solutions with a high benefitthese and other solutions are viewed by technotrans as integral for sustainable production in this context two combination units for dampening solution circulation and ink unit temperature control are particularly noteworthy the powercontrolled alphac eco system is suitable for small to medium formats whereas the betac blue system is used for medium to large formats both systems offer energyefficient cooling concepts for the infinitely variable adaptation of the refrigeration capacity to the actual demand resourceefficient solutions eg the alcosmart azr with a particularly high level of alcohol dosing accuracy will also be presented by technotrans at the drupa smarter control and interconnectionwith the presentation of their smart systems which facilitate simultaneous operation and monitoring the company from sassenberg provides visitors with an interesting look to the future
