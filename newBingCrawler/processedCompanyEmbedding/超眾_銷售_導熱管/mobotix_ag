october   platforms linux os x windows overview the eventstream client sdk implements the eventstream command protocol that is needed to access the eventstream service of mobotix cameras from a c application this service provides access to live av streams as well as to recordings stored on the camera in addition the eventstream service includes a notification mechanism that allows the camera to send event notifications to the client the entire communication is handled through a single tcp connection the platform specific packages include the required library and header files and some sample c code together with a documentation of the usage release notes this is the initial release of eventstream client sdk for linux x os x x and windows x here you find a short description of the sdks features and its usage further information is included in the file docreadmetxt which is contained in the platform specific packages download packages linux eventstreamclientlinuxxtgz os x eventstreamclientdarwinxtgz windows eventstreamclientwindowszip mxmessagesystem version  status release publishing date october   platforms linux os x windows bit overview the mobotix mxmessagesystem allows actions and alarm notifications to be sent and received throughout the entire network the mobotix mxmessagesystem sdk helps system integrators and software developers to integrate the mxmessagesystem into their own c applications as well as to send and receive messages release notes second release of mxmessagesystem sdk for linux ubuntu  x os x x and now additionally windows x supports sending and receiving of mxmessages further information are included in the readmehtml which is included in the zip file obsolete versions v dec 7  download package mxmessagesystem sdk  package for linux os x and winmxmessagesystemsdkdemovzip mxcamerasystem note you can download the entire current sdk  package here obsolete sdk releases    overview the mobotix mxcamerasystem sdk is intended to support software developers of eg surveillance solutions andor video management systems in integrating mobotix network cameras into their products typical integration tasks here include retrieval and decoding of mxpeg videoaudio streams for the purpose of displaying analyzing converting post processing or storing programmatically changing camera settings and parameters programmatically making use of camera events programmatically triggering signal output and other camera actions as for example ftp transfers or the sending of mail messages to assist in solving these tasks mobotix offers three different levels of integration support providing the developer with varying degrees of control these levels are the camera http api the mxpeg activex component the open source mxpeg decoding library c and they will be discussed more thoroughly in the following sections the intended audience for the software development kit are system integrators and developers with a background in image compression in order to reasonably make use of the included source code solid experience with c development is required please note that mobotix ags regular product support does not include assistance in programming with the sdks c library however feel free to contact mxpegsdkmobotixcom if you have questions of this sort or regarding mxpeg in general whats new in release  the sole purpose of this release is to publish an updated version of the mobotix mxpeg activex component new mobotix mxpeg activex component version  whats new in release  the major changes clearly have been improvements to the included c library package first off theres been a change in functional scope the package no longer contains any user interface andor video display elements but concentrates on the actual mxpeg decoding instead thus the dependency on qt has been eliminated as another consequence the portable mxpeg player application is no longer part of mxpeg sdk audio support  the decoder interfaces have been extended in order to also hand decoded audio data over to the client application code for further processing note however that in order to actually hear anything you will have to provide your own audio output routines for your specific target platform  a fact that is now also true for displaying video as was requested by many customers the package now also compiles under microsoft visual c at mx were working and testing with visual studio  we are currently migrating considerable parts of our codebase to a component oriented design with the mxpeg sdk c package actually being a subset of it as a result the mxpeg sdk code has also been reworked and molded into components and its infrastructure and interfaces have received a fair amount of streamlining in the process the actual mxpeg decoder engine has grown more mature it implements a larger subset of the jpeg stream specification including an additional subsampling mode enabling it to also properly digest mjpeg streams coming in from certain axis and merritlilin camera models hands more frame parameters over to the client application and has an improved handling of error conditions version mobotix mxcamerasystem sdk release  release date feb   activex version  compatible camera models all mobotix cameras compatible camera software versions all versions top of page camera http api the http api allows your software to interact with mobotix cameras by invoking special cgi programs via standard http transactions and by processing potential reply messages the http api is supported by all mobotix camera models and among other things can be used to retrieve single camera images or continous mxpeg  mjpeg video streams via the http protocol programmatically change camera settings and parameters programmatically make use of camera events programmatically trigger signal output and other camera actions as for example ftp transfers or the sending of mail messages camera http api http api documentation reproduced from the cameras online help image retrieval  streaming cgi documentation reproduced from the cameras online help remote configuration cgi documentation reproduced from the cameras online help note please note that these api pages are not generic but depend on the camera model and software version it is thus highly recommended to open the http api and cgi parameters of the mobotix camera help topics on your camera to find the options that are available top of page mxpeg activex component the mxpeg activex component shipping with each mobotix camera can be used as a plugin in microsoft internet explorer thus allowing for playback of live or stored mxpeg video streams in the web browser including audio if desired mjpeg streams can be displayed as well but obviously without sound what makes the mxpeg activex component furthermore attractive in regard to integration efforts is that it can be integrated into rd party ms windows applications in order to display mxpeg streams received fom mobotix cameras in the activex components display window optionally including audio playback display mjpeg video streams received fom mobotix cameras in the activex components display window no audio playback in this case retrieve and decode mxpeg or mjpeg streams handing the individual frame bitmaps over to the client application for further processing mxpeg activex component demo page including interface description also used to install the mxpeg activex component automatically mxpeg activex component for bit computers manual installation mxpeg activex component for bit computersmanual installation top of page mxpeg c library as part of the software development kit mobotix releases a c library in open source form under the bsd license it provides mxpeg decoding to system integrators and runs on windows linux and mac os x system integrators are encouraged to incorporate the code in their own software products since the sources are freely available potential shortcomings if they should be considered as such can be easily fixed as missing features for a given specific application scenario can be added by using the mxpeg sdk c library application developers have the most flexible access to mxpeg or mjpeg video streams coming in from mobotix cameras in contrast to the activex component described earlier due to their platformindependent nature these classes can be used to build applications that can be deployed on windows linux or mac os x the c library basically implements an objectoriented decoder infrastructure allowing for the processing of mxpeg streams including video and optional audio mjpeg streams videoonly in the typical case your client application will feed an mxpeg stream into the decoder and be then presented with a sequence of decoded video tiles x pixels threebytergb audio blocks all together with the necessary timestamp information for proper resynchronization furthermore entire frames can be dumped in raw rgb or yuv formats as well as they can be repacked into individual single jpeg frames to complete the package there is also an optional qtdependent part of the library that provides support for the aforementioned camera http api by implementing classes for comfortably performing http get transactions with remote cameras please note again that assistance in programming with the sdks c library is not included in mobotix ags regular product support note also that solid experience with c development is required to reasonably put to use the included source code open source crossplatform c library readme license online reference documentation source code package mxpeg converter mxgconv binaries for windows linux mac os x intel top of page mxpeg format
