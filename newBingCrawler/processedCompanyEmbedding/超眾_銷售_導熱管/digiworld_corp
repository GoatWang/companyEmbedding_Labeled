tgdđ we just had a conversation with mrdoan hong viet chairman of the board of digiworld about pharmaceutical story the area that digiworld and many large companies have been targeting dear mrviet there are many electronic and mobile phone corporations embarking on pharmaceutical industry in your opinion is it due to the saturation of electronics which forces these companies to look for new directions every market has to mature and saturate at some point enterprises who want to thrive must always actively seek for food sources from the blue ocean not keep competing forever in the red ocean in  digiworld dgw had completed its foundation to officially become a market expansion service provider therefore  is the time for us to expand our business seeking for opportunity to grow with new potential market dgw with its strengths of mes market expansion services is confident in bringing winwin cooperation to both dgw and its partners who have good products but weak branding according to roland bergers latest report in january  mes service in asia is witnessing strong growth particularly in southeast asia forecasted growthrate from  to  reaches  in particular healthcare industry is growing thanks to the improvement in quality of life and health awareness while governments also invests in health care system according to roland berger forecasted growthrate of mes for healthcare in vietnam from  to  is to reach  besides fmcg is growing steadily thanks to increases in incomes population and rising middle class in asia in accordance to roger berger growthrate of mes for fmcg in vietnam from  to  is forecasted to reach  sir how much is the profit margin of supplement business risks in this industry estimated profit margin of this industry is over  as dgw has the ability to involve in many stages in the value chain which compile high profit marginrevenue contribution at vnd  billion in  and growthrate is expected to reach year target to reach vnd  billion in revenue by  the risks in this industry are as followings firstly the number of users is still limited due to the the majority of vietnameses behavior of curing rather than preventing although it has improved more than before secondly there are difficulties in communication due to blur regulation on medicines and supplement thirdly high tax rates lead to high costs finally consumers are losing trust in product quality many risks are mentioned why digiworld chooses pharmacy vietnams population is huge and moving into aging progress we are still in the stage of young population but moving fast to aging stage many vietnameses have good income i am confident to say every family sitting here is using at least one supplement product which is not curing medicines by the age of  people have signs of aging and will look for supplement products the market is very potential who is digiworlds rival in the pharmaceutical market dksh is similar in term of business model but target customers are different therefore we do not step on each others foot it would happen if digiworld grows fastbut not in the coming time other companies such as the gioi di dong do retailing and that they could be digiworlds customers in pharmaceutical sector vietnamese pharmaceutical companies are doing all sorts of things from production to distribution likewise they may become digiworlds customers if we prove that we distribute better in the extensive pharmaceutical market what segment do you focus on we focus on supplement products and overthecounter medicines many large companies take part in pharmaceutical market so how does digiworld enter into this market at the moment large pharmaceutical companies manufacture and distribute products by themselves small companies produce and distribute in small areas only but not strong enough to deploy nationwide they are digiworlds targetedcustomer digiworld will help them distribute nationwide market needs an intermediary inbetween a wideenough distribution channel and brand marketing capabilities to be popular and distributed nationwide only a few domestic companies are distributing nationwide such as traphaco duoc hau giang digiworld focuses on otc market retail market at pharmacies not prescription otcs customers are quite similar to fmcgs customers meaning that customers only make purchases after getting to know about the products hearing the marketing message somewhere salesperson can explain more for them such quite similar to fmcg and those are what digiworld has products may be different but ways of branding marketing and organizing distribution are similar and about the story of the gioi di dong entering pharmaceutical industry they do retail not wholesale like digiworld nationwide there are about  pharmacies the biggest retailer only has  drug stores comparing with cellphone there are about  stores the gioi di dong has about  stores digiworld has a different angle there are many manufacturers they do not know how to promote their brand thats exactly what digiworld is aiming at digiworld will not open retailing stores to compete with the others as well as the gioi di dong in the future the gioi di dong will always be digiworlds customer they are  supplementary pieces whether the way dgw distributing pharmaceutical products be different from the way pharmaceutical companies are doing now dgws products are not as biopharmaceuticals like pharmaceutical companies overthecounter and prescription but as supplement products and otc medicines apart from pharmacy channel dgw will also focus on other channels such as convenience stores healthcare supermarkets… and ecommerce thank you for sharing source cafebiz sharing and personal tools please select the service you want to use newsvine digg delicious stumbleupon
