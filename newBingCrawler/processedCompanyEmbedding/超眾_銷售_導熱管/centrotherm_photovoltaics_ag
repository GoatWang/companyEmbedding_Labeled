wins two if product design awards for photovoltaic key equipment “cfire“ and “gp isotest waf“ centrotherm photovoltaics ag has won two if product design awards  for its photovoltaic key equipment “cfire“ and “gp isotest waf“ both products the “cfire“ fast firing furnace and the wafer inspection tool “gp isotestwaf” impressed the international jury not only with their outstanding design but also with their functionality innovation and environmental sustainability the “cfire“ fast firing furnace in which the front and rear contacts are burned into wafers at high temperatures is the latest generation of the established fast firing furnace and is characterized by its compact design besides this footprint the installation and maintance systems have been further optimized in order to reduce the operating costs for solar cell producers volatile organic compounds vocs that arise during the burning process were also taken into account voc treatment was fully integrated into the restructured housing thereby enabling any solvents that are emitted to be fed back on a reliable and energyefficient basis the new “cfire“ fast firing furnace also impressed a taiwanese customer within a few weeks the equipment was installed rampedup and had passed the site acceptance test the “gp isotest waf“ enables the quality control of wafers in the solar cell production it monitors the insulation resistance between the front and rear side of wafers and enables contributes to the reduction of manufacturing costs in mass production the design unifies cost optimized production and longevity   „we are proud to have received this prestigious honor not only for our design but also for our technological and innovation strength“ commented dr peter fath cto of centrotherm photovoltaics ag “at the same time this award is further motivation for us to continously optimize technology and equipment for the production of solar cells in order to increase cell efficiency and to make solar power even more attractive“ the if product design award is one of the most prestigious industrial design awards and has been presented annually for nearly  vears add announcement
