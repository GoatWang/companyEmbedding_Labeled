miaoli innolux corp  the lcd panel manufacturing arm of hon hai precision industry co  yesterday said it plans to double its revenue within two years by reviving its electronics assembly business and developing nextgeneration display technologiesthe production revamp is aimed at minimizing the impact on the company of the lcd industry’s boomandbust cycle innolux saidthat could also open the door to future cooperation between innolux and foxconn technology group  companies including hon hai and sharp corp it added“since innolux no longer invests substantially on building new flatpanel capacity as hon hai and sharp are doing now i believe there will certainly be collaboration opportunities between us” chairman wang jyhchao  told a media briefing after the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting at its headquarters in miaoli county“we will more than welcome the chance to source panels from hon hai and sharp for  tv assembly” wang saidas innolux has just resumed its electronics assembly lines the company has yet to decide whether to make tvs for hon hai and sharp wang saidin march the flatpanel maker launched a production restructuring plan after its financial status

leds to light up a flexible display compared with  million to  million for microled ting said“our miniled technology will be ready in about one year then we can start to engage with potential customers” ting saidinnolux shareholders yesterday approved a plan to distribute a cash dividend of nt per common share based on last year’s net profit of nt billion or earnings of nt per share this
