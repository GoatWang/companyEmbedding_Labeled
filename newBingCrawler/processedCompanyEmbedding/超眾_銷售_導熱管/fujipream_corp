flat panel display｜fuji pream corporation contact japanese 　　 home    flat panel display product ⁄ technologyflat panel display flat panel display departmentfinetech division high quality supported by ultraprecision lamination that the world admitted the overwhelming share in japan domestic and oversea market prove it various types of optical films are used in display devices and their performance depends greatly on the quality of the precision laminating technology fujipreams precision laminating technology has earned high acclaim in both the japanese and international market in areas such as plasma tvs lcds smartphones tablets laptop computers and car navigation systems we are trusted by customers for our highprecision technology for beautifully and safely displaying images and our strict quality control system and we provide products not only to major consumer electronics manufacturers in japan but also to a whole spectrum of other companies in addition we are actively working to expand into new businesses such as prototyping for new technologies and new products based on the trust and track record we have established precision laminating technology is essential for achievingbeautiful and safe display on flat displays various types of optical films are used in the display screens of digital products such as lcd monitors smartphones tablets laptop computers and car navigation systems these films are essential for providing touch panel functionality and achieving beautiful safe display of images so they play an extremely important role in determining product quality superior to conventional concepts and technology products called optical filters are manufactured by laminating together multiple functional films of different types and precision laminating technology is critically important due to the complexity and high degree of precision required thanks to our superior quality fujipream has an overwhelming share in the display device market which is primarily focused on flat panel displays difficulty of laminating largescreen flat displays today flat panel displays have replaced crts to become the mainstream technology for monitors and televisions and they are rapidly increasing in size and diversity as a result composite functionality has become a requisite for optical filters higher precision and technological innovation are in constant demand from new materials to lamination using complex methods to achieve a stable supply in addition to efficiency and cost yield is an important factor due to the expense of key materials as a leading company in this field we have pioneered technologies and knowhow for cleanroom management we meet user needs through highquality manufacturing and contribute to the evolution of display devices by opening up new possibilities in precision lamination an integrated product system centered around lamination for achieving worldclass high quality and added value at fujipream we carry out the complete process—from material cutting to lamination and assembly—at our own plants we offer strict quality control and optimal process selection commitment to nextgeneration displays we are strengthening our ability to handle a diverse range of nextgeneration display products by applying ultraprecision laminating technology only fujipream can provide large touch panels direct bonding to achieve integration of the cover glass and display device laminating between hard materials is effective for products such as displays requiring touch panels or cover glass this enables direct bonding through atmospheric lamination d displays stressfree lamination exploiting outstanding material characteristics functional films are evolving in areas such as the medical and amusement markets by laminating precisely along pixel lines it is possible to suppress minute deformation caused by lamination and prevent loss of material characteristics small and medium touch panels multipanel lamination for simultaneously laminating multiple films this lamination is effective for substrates with multiple patterns as seen with small and medium products this enables precision lamination on the micron scale of multiple films at one time processing technology and production equipment for the nextgeneration by establishing new processing technologies and developing production equipment we are further bolstering our capabilities in new fields tape attachment lamination for simultaneously laminating four edges laminating between hard materials is effective for products such as displays requiring touch panels or cover glass this enables direct bonding through atmospheric lamination cutting with alignment function cutting equipment with an alignment function enables precision punching out of patterned film autoclave treatment our autoclave treatment equipment can also handle large displays in the case of small and medium displays it achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of batches acf attachment fpc pressure bonding fpc pressure bonding is necessary for touch panels processing that accompanies lamination can also be performed appearance inspection sensory inspection by personnel makes diverse filter inspection over short timeframes possible we have human resources with extensive experience in the inspection of surface and base materials home    flat panel display

solar panels with mw output were mounted on roofs that can withstand a load of kgm photo by asahi glass fig  attached by clasps and bolts strength enough to keep the panels from being blown away by the wind without making a hole in the roof photo by asahi glass facility overview cover glass thickness reduced by  if the weight of a solar panel were reduced the load capacity required to install solar panels could be lowered and the number of roofs that can be equipped with panels would greatly increase there would be the possibility of introducing an onrooftype solar power generation system to buildings and houses on which the owners have thus far not been able to mount solar panels because of their poor load capacity in addition the density of installation can be raised on the roofs on which the density of solar panels was restricted specifically many roofs on which the solar panels were installed this time had a load capacity of kgm or more on these roofs mitsubishi electric corps existing solar panel which weighs kg per panel or kgm was installed fig  however some roofs only had a load capacity of kgm due to the load capacity the existing solar panel weighing kgm could not be set up on these roofs accordingly fujipream corps solar panel whose weight was cut by about half to kg per panel or kgm was installed on these roofs of the m roofs mounted with solar panels lightweighted roofs account for about m the  crystalline silicon solar panels installed consist of  existing panels by mitsubishi electric about mw and  lightweight panels by fujipream about mw according to asahi glass some roofs load capacity was low depending on the purpose of the building not when the building was constructed the company had some reasons not to give priority to the load capacity such as there being no need to attach a crane on the roof and the necessity to quickly complete the building the lightweight solar panel uses asahi glass chemically enhanced glass leoflex as cover glass this product achieved a thickness of mm a sharp reduction from the existing models mm the weight was  less than that of the existing model but its features such as the cover glass strength were maintained the weight of the cover glass accounts for  or more of the overall weight of a crystalline silicon solar panel and therefore is a major factor when cutting the weight of a solar panel asahi glass not only supplied glass but also offered other information including that on its optimum usage on the other hand there is the problem that this new glass costs more than the existing cover glass but the cost is expected to decline as its deployment increases because leoflex is manufactured by the float process just like glass substrates for lcd panels and it can easily generate a
