the obstacles to unipixels production and shipments  unipixel inc nasdaqunxl  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»the obstacles to unipixels production and shipmentsnov   about unipixel inc unxl richard x roe longshort equitythe reason for the ongoing delay in production and shipments of unipixels nasdaqunxl touch sensors since april appears to be the unacceptable as low as  manufacturing yield at the module level effectively rendering the product unusable todays press release about a purchase order seems to be a diversion similar to an earlier announcement by a competitor atmel nasdaqatml that reported an order and subsequent shipment to asus otcakcpf but the few thousand sensors shipped never ended up in devices on the store shelves the irony is that based on public disclosures the touch modules built with unipixels product are simply not price competitive so the company may be unable to find customers even if it gives its sensors away for free lack of product qualification when asked about the obstacles to meaningful production at the oppenheimer emerging innovations conference on september  unipixels ceo stated that it was all about quality and testing admitting but if we are shipping rolls of film over there to the module integration partner in china and they are die cutting and laminating and coming back and saying you guys are only yielding  or only yielding  we have to scratch our heads and say where is the failure happening because it should be better than that so we look at it and if we dont get it  tested before it gets there then when they handle it do they scratch it or have a bad tab tapeautomated bonding on do they have this or that then it becomes a pissing contest about whose problem it is and we dont necessarily want that  coming out of the gate we want to be able to be in control of our investment there even a  deviation from anticipated yield in the module integration process at the touch panel manufacturer that is the odm before the final screen is shipped to the pc manufacturer that is the oem is problematic because the odm profit margins are already razor thin for example tpk tt the largest and most efficient touch module maker had only a  gross margin and a  operating margin in the latest quarter unipixel has always maintained that there are no quality problems on its side the company previously told investors on the february  earnings call that if it had to ship product on that day it could in march at the roth capital partners annual growth stock conference it disclosed that it expected yields to be  and improve further by the time the companys production capacity was to go live in late april the number had dropped to  but the company was planning to improve it by introducing more automated realtime inline testing as disclosed on the april  earnings call unipixel made its first productionlevel shipment attempt on april  the handpicked  sensor units were to be assembled by the odm into touch modules within the following  weeks and then used in touchenabled notebooks that were to undergo extensive qualification testing on may  the company disclosed a production and shipment delay putting the blame on its pc manufacturing partner and microsoft claiming that a slippage in windows  release date caused the pc partner to change its anticipated design and production timeline and moving the expectation for products on the shelves from q to q that explanation makes no sense by the time unipixel shipped its first sensor units in late april it was common knowledge that windows  would be released to manufacturers on or around august and microsoft ended up delivering it right on target in late august moreover a windows  delay should not have affected any pc design changes or notebook release dates windows  is not a new operating system but a minor update available for free download for any pc that has windows  already installed specifically all the  hardware requirements for touch screens see the devicedigitizertouch section have remained the same between the  and  versions at the cowen technology media  telecom conference on may  right around the time when the odm was supposed to have completed the modules from the first sensor batch the companys ceo told investors that the shipment had been effectively rejected and the company was working on redesigning the sensor and reshipping the units at some future date supposedly the pc partner was doing away with the home button a change in the design caused by the operating system update delay however that explanation also makes no sense as the first  units shipped were notebook sensor units and unlike tablets notebooks designed for windows simply do not have a home button on the screen to begin with  that function is fulfilled by a windows logo key or  on the keyboard moreover a delay in a notebook platform should not have affected the production and shipments of tablet units in q on its earnings call in november  the company had disclosed that its design wins were staged right behind each other at that time there were four products  one  notebook and three  inch tablets on an investor call on april  only eleven days before the shipment attempt the company maintained that its sensors were scheduled to be utilized in two notebook and three tablet products as part of the production orders to be placed by the pc partner in q and that order visibility was pretty good and since some of the designs were supposed to be transitional products already on the market to be retrofitrefreshed with unipixels sensor rather than dedicated new products designed specificity to unipixels sensor a postponement of one platform should not have affected the planned retrofit with unipixels sensors in the quarter all the pc oems have continued to manufacture touchenabled devices and have released new tablet and notebook models since including ones with windows  preinstalled finally if the delay were only due to an operating system or a home button redesign unipixel should have been back on track already on the august  earnings call the company reported that it was submitting new sensors for evaluation and approval meaning its sensors still had a chance to be built into modules sometime in september and appear in final products on store shelves in q however on september  the companys ceo not only confirmed that it was already too late for products on the shelves by the end of the year but when asked about q  he offered an uncommitted i think so followed by the qualification that  it is up to its pc partner whether to put product on the shelves and  the pc partner may not necessarily be the one with the first product despite having certain exclusivity as of today despite the press release about a purchase order there has been no announcement from the company that it has met its production qualification requirements or that its sensors are about to appear in actual devices on store shelves lack of price competitiveness getting a purchase order and even shipping a product may be moot at this point the touch modules with unipixel sensors appear to be priced too high compared to the regular ito modules which dominate the market and may not sell based on public selling price disclosures by the company even if the company were to give away its product for free the module price may still be above current market prices the touch market had been capacity constrained in late  and early  especially for largersize modules driving prices up and forcing pc oems to scramble to secure guaranteed supply at the time paying for new capacity or even new but unproven technologies such as metal mesh probably sounded like a good idea a pc manufacturer signed a multimillion dollar preferred price and capacity license agreement with unipixel in december intel nasdaqintc followed up in april after having previously paid millions of dollars to the major touch module makers to ensure adequate production capacity however by august the shortage was all over in early september intel declared that touch as a supply issue is completely gone in effect admitting that securing touch production capacity may have been a mistake and waste of money when asked at the oppenheimer conference a few days later about the developing price war and oversupply in the touch market the ceo admitted his belief that tpk was selling a inch touch module at  per diagonal inch but the ceo did not agree with intels conclusion stating every time intel comes back to talk to us they say the price is going down and i say no it is not notebook module prices have fallen  since a recent research report stated that the price of a inch module was expected to decrease from  to  or  per diagonal inch touching  in  and  in  and then on november  digitimes reported notebook vendors have begun to increasingly care about the price of touch panels but not about quality and quotes for notebookuse touch panel modules have dropped from inch in the first half of  to inch in mid and further to inch currently touch modules for tablets are also dropping in price  witsview reports  average price for a inch touch module in october or inch an  drop from september on its latest earnings call tpk said that it did not expect prices to stabilize at least until q  unipixel insists that it is the lowcost producer in the world even though it is not shipping product and its qualification units fail on module level the slide below taken from the companys presentation at the roth conference just eight months ago shows pricing and savings comparison between the products on the market overwhelmingly using ito technologies and unipixels for various sensors and modules built from those sensors unipixels pricing structure specifically on module level is already woefully outdated for example using the numbers from the table a inch unipixel sensor for tablets is sold for  generating savings of  compared to the  ito sensor so the ito module is  since the  sensor is  of the module price while the module with a unipixels sensor is supposed to be about  providing  savings vs the ito module even if unipixel gives away its sensor for free the module price comes down to something like   less the  sensor but the current market price for inch touch modules is  or about  lower than the price of a module with a free unipixel sensor from the table similarly a inch unipixel sensor for tablets is sold for  generating savings of  compared to the  ito sensor so the ito module is  since the  sensor is  of the module price while the module with a unipixels sensor is supposed to be about  providing  savings vs the ito module even if unipixel gives away its sensor for free the module price comes down to something like   less the  sensor but the current market price for inch touch modules is about   x inch or about  lower than a module with a free unipixel sensor kodak cant turn things around just a few days before unipixels first shipment in april kodak nysekodk signed a manufacturing and supply agreement to jointly produce the companys sensors kodaks renewed emphasis on printed electronics with specific focus on touch sensors and its continued involvement with the company may appear to be a major boost to unipixels credibility however the management that got kodak into trouble and chapter  has not changed in the words of a former employee its hard to believe that you can solve a problem using the same consciousness that created it in the first place kodaks initial foray into touch sensors in  using a different technology has failed to gain any market traction even today the company is hedging its bet by actively partnering with kingsburyoptimation techology planning its first market entry with them while the partnership with unipixel is supposed to be a next phase  slide  kodaks ambivalence is probably justified print experts intimately familiar with kodaks capabilities and the limits of printing technology are skeptical that even kodak possesses the ability to reliably print micronwide lines with catalytic ink using a flexographic process unipixel has been secretive about its printing process but customs records show that a flexographic cleaning machine destined for the joint manufacturing facility arrived in late september to quote there is a difference between technically possible and technically probable so it is not surprising that several officers and directors of unipixel set up b trading plans in early june shortly after

 more search options press release sec tech company misled investors about key product for immediate release  washington dc march  — the securities and exchange commission today announced that a developer of technologies for touchscreen devices has agreed to pay  to settle charges that it misled investors about the production status and sales agreements for a key product two former company executives face related charges in an sec complaint filed today in us district court for the southern district of texas  the sec entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the company’s former chairman of the board who has agreed to cooperate and be barred from serving as an officer and director for five years   the sec alleges that unipixel inc began publicly touting sales of a touchscreen sensor product supposedly in speedy highvolume commercial production when in fact only a few samples had been manually completed  the misrepresentations caused unipixel’s stock price to more than double enabling thenceo reed killion and thencfo jeffrey tomz to make more than  million in personal profits from selling their own shares of company stock  killion and tomz allegedly knew the company’s statements were untrue and unipixel’s manufacturing process was still incapable of mass producing commercial quantities of sensors   “we allege that unipixel and top executives portrayed a company whose technology had arrived when in truth it was still in the developmental stage” said shamoil t shipchandler director of the sec’s fort worth regional office  “tech companies and their officers must be honest with investors about the state of their products and cannot portray them as something they are not”   according to the sec’s complaint unipixel announced “multimillion dollar” sales agreements in  and  that highlighted potential revenues but omitted material conditions the company had to meet to actually receive those revenues unipixel announced in april  that its highvolume production line was “qualified and production ready” and its capacity “started at fifty moving to hundreds and then thousands over the next several months”  at the time unipixel had yet to produce any functional sensors through its highspeed process unipixel issued a press release in november  touting a “purchase order” for its sensors that expected to ship an initial “commercial run” of sensors by yearend  the company concealed that the order was for a mere  worth of sensors for the customer to review as samples   without admitting or denying the sec’s charges unipixel consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating section a of the securities act of  and sections b a and b of the securities and exchange act of  as well as rules b b a a and a  the settlement is subject to court approval  the sec’s litigation continues against killion and tomz   the deferred prosecution agreement with former board chairman bernard t marren alleges that he became aware that information in unipixel’s press releases was inaccurate but failed to ensure that the company corrected the releases  the agreement requires him to cooperate with the sec’s continuing case while complying with certain undertakings in order to avoid civil charges against him    the sec’s investigation was conducted by david whipple carol hahn and david king and the case was supervised by jessica magee in the sec’s fort worth regional office  the sec’s litigation will be led by matt gulde  related materials complaint  unipixel killion tomz deferred prosecution

commodity product with poor prospectsa sensor with no customer unipixel nasdaqunxl intends to launch its first product an allinone aio touch sensor with a inch diagonal sometime this quarter february call transcript and needham conference presentation  this might be a problem because the end client is apparently unaware that it would be receiving commercial shipments of such a sensor unipixel formally engaged an aio original equipment manufacturer oem as a development customer in august last year august call transcript it was identified as elo touch systems at the liolios conference in september  by jeff hawthorne unipixels ceo personal communication according to elos customer service the company does not sell nor has any plans to sell a inch aio device see current aio offerings the closest comparable product offered by elo is a inch aio with a choice of either resistive or surfaceacoustic touch rather than unipixels projected capacitive procap touch sensor unipixel was asked to reconfirm that elo is still the aio oem and explain the size discrepancy between the sensor and elos offerings but the company did not respond elo owned by a private equity firm is one of the oldest companies in the touch industry and supplies a variety of touch solutions including touchscreen components touchmonitors and aio touchcomputers using several touch technologies and targeting digital signage retail pointofsale hospitality medicalhealthcare it industrial and consumer however elos business has been in gradual decline due to competition in these mostly mature or lowvolume markets annual revenues are now down to about  million from  million in  and the companys debt carries a high risk of default elo has declined to comment on specific questions about the nature of the relationship with unipixel citing corporate policy and confidentiality but elos familiarity with unipixel predates august elo has been evaluating the technology at least since the beginning of last year when according to unipixels ceo elo received a functional inch sensor prototype from unipixel unipixel had previously claimed in november  that it had received purchase orders from unnamed customers for a inch aio sensor and a inch touchmonitor for delivery in q last year but no product sales ever materialized there is also a youtube video posted in may last year showing a test performed on the inch unipixel touch sensor made for elo not ready to launch there are a number of clues that unipixel is not prepared to ship or even accept an order this quarter for example unipixel is no longer a productionstage company from  until this year unipixel had used this label in all its sec filings but it is now only in a preproduction stage according to the latest k filing the filing also outlines a commercialization roadmap that is considerably less aggressive that the guidance on the february call  production of viable commercial intouch touch screens is targeted within  months sometime in late  as supposed to  months this quarter an aio integration trial that was initially scheduled for january needham conference presentation  was not finished even though samples had been delivered to two module integrators vying for elos business february call transcript the development customer had not yet picked which one of those module integrators would be tasked with assembling the sensor into a module and no pricing had been set unipixel doesnt even have an updated product datasheet  the one shown on unipixels website was last modified in december  see pdf metadata and still has spelling errors for example link instead of ink does not mention the new proprietary blackening coating march corporate presentation slide  and has an important specification discrepancy compared to the latest k line width of  μm compared to  μm the company is also missing the critical windows  certification for its sensor despite working on it since  personal communication unipixels analyst day in december was promoted as a unique opportunity to showcase the companys commercialization readiness but it was only open to select audience and media were excluded even though the event was hosted at a kodak nysekodk facility and the presentation was authored by kodak according to the pdf metadata kodaks investor relations explained that there were no kodak invitees and unipixel was managing all event aspects personal communication in the past unipixel had been very successful with its factory tours and demos in fooling willing attendees into believing that production was imminent  like the touch display research analyst convinced that mass production would start in july after an infab personal tour and survey of operations in april  personal communication or the cowen  co analysts believing in imminent q  volume production after a tour in august in contrast when atmel nasdaqatml organized a tour of its touch sensor facilities in november  media were welcomed and the company was actually producing commercially because tablet devices using its sensors showed up in stores later that month personal visit of an office depot store more telling kodak which is contracted to actually produce the sensors has not confirmed unipixels guidance for a commercial launch this quarter according to the manufacturing and supply agreement with unipixel kodak is intimately involved in the business planning and project operations influencing potential order schedules pricing costs etc but kodak claims to be working on tablet sensors not aio sensors we continue work with unipixel on building the initial production quantities necessary to support lead customers assessments in the medium and large display tablet markets kodak march call transcript further commenting on the status of the unipixel project jeff clarke kodaks ceo acknowledged remaining technical hurdles which have continued to date and did not mention upcoming commercial revenues at the same time he hoped for modest revenue this quarter from commercial shipments by the other touch sensor partner kingsbury a direct unipixel competitor utilizing a silverhalide technology developed by kodak kodaks ceo also noted that he would not want to bet on startup businesses in the  guidance emphasizing that the revenue and ebitda contribution from touch would be a very small number this year this was a change from the kodak august call when he expected that revenues from the touch sensors projects would be in the tens of millions for the year actual commercial revenues from both unipixel and kingsbury turned out zero last year requests submitted to both kodak and unipixel for explanation of the apparent difference in expectations about a product launch this quarter have remained unanswered past promises and management departures unipixel has a history of committing to commercialization in an upcoming quarter and predictably failing to achieve it for example in the qa at the liolios conference about three weeks before the start of q last year unipixels ceo was explicitly asked about a possible delay but he was adamant that the target for initial revenues remained q as expected unipixel did not achieve commercialization and made no shipments during the quarter previously unipixels directors and interim coceos carl yankowski and bernie marren had targeted an initial manufacturing ramp by q last year in a january  press release with the same effect numerous failed commercialization targets during the tenure of reed killion the former ceo have been documented elsewhere a number of notable personnel departures from unipixel and kodak in recent months also cast doubt about an imminent product launch robert berg unipixels senior vp of sales and marketing for more than a year left in june last year to reunite with his former employer  a surprising move if large sales commissions were just around the corner unipixel did not announce his departure even though he had been listed on the companys management webpage daniel van ostrand the founder and senior vp of engineering and rd left in september last year after  years with the company to pursue other interests namely working as a consultant to the printed electronics industry touch gesture motion conference speaker list with a website proclaiming to be the future home of something cool he also sold all his unipixel stock in december on the day the company was hosting its analyst day martin kykta unipixels senior research scientist  responsible for developing improving and measuring the flexible electronics to be used in touch sensors  left in august after seven years with the company to be a fulltime president of his own oneman electrooptics consultancy speaker list douglas edwards kodaks head of functional printing who had overseen the touch sensor projects since  left in december after reorganization the business under a new name is now managed on an interim basis tablet sensor flop in may last year less than a month after his appointment unipixels ceo announced that based on new roadmap technical work streams had now focused on development project to produce an initial product for the tablet market he selected a new product a inch tablet sensor because unipixels technology most readily applied to that size may call transcript previously the company had worked primarily on notebook and larger size sensors the company also engaged a new development customer and eventually received touch and optical performance approval analyst day presentation slide  the customer was supposed to buy this sensor when the product was fully ready may call transcript but in october the customer decided not to place an order and instructed unipixel to start working on another tablet design instead according to unipixel unipixels ceo blames the market at the time we decided to develop the inch there was a pretty reasonable market for it whats happened since is that the inch market has really been going into oversupply so our customer asked us to focus on inch instead of inch needham conference presentation  that explanation makes no sense for three reasons first the may press release insisted that the other touchscreen market segments were to be addressed only after this initial inch product launch yet unipixel rushed to start work on the aio program in august and then proceeded with the new inch program in october march corporate presentation slide  without ever shipping the inch product for revenue second the development customers decision not to proceed with the inch sensor should not have affected purchase orders by other interested parties on the may call unipixel had argued that there was a wide selection of candidates lined up as potential development customers for such a sensor third the weakness in tablet shipments did not suddenly occur in september or october  any oversupply condition should have been evident much earlier the tablet market was already crashing in the summer of last year picture  kodak manager mike smith showing off the inch sensor rejected by the customer nyt video  in may last year displaysearch a research outfit often quoted by unipixel had already warned that for the first time ever tablet shipments registered a yearoveryear decline in april yet unipixel maintained that the tablet market was healthy with exceptional growth underscoring the magnitude of the initial opportunity unipixel was pursuing may call transcript even most recently on the call last february the ceo was still describing tablets as a growing market opportunity despite tablet display shipments experiencing yearoveryear declines of  and  in january and february according to witsview see table labeled shipment and use wayback machine for earlier data huge market but no order every major tablet manufacturer except apple sells and actively develops inch tablets today these small tablets still command the dominant market share about  of total unit shipments displaysearch press release the inch segment has always been extremely competitive and inch whitelabel tablets have been selling for as low as  since last summer if the customer actually made and sold inch tablets and if unipixels sensors had decent performance and price advantages the customer should have been even more eager to order the sensors to counteract the drop in tablet selling price and preserve margins moreover the patient customer as it was portrayed on the february call should have placed the order early on so it can be the first in line to receive shipments and have a cost advantage against the competition once the market balance were eventually restored picture  singulated inch sensor film sheets and packing label analyst day video  however unipixel and its partner appear more interested in development than actual sales unipixel continued to tout its progress with the inch sensor throughout last year but was short on specifics in august unipixel announced the delivery of the first tens of samples to the tablet development customer august call transcript  on the analyst day video recorded at kodaks facilities the product is shown as tested and packaged for shipment see from  till end  the sensor does not look very transparent possibly due to sensor line width not within specifications wastes too much film each sensor sheet takes about  sqft instead of the optimal  sqft and the final verification and packaging process appears too labor intensive on the august call the ceo initially stated that the sensor samples had already undergone integration and performance evaluation by the customer providing valuable integration yield data and positive feedback on sensor performance but when asked on the call how many had been actually assembled into modules the ceo contradicted himself by replying that the customer was still working on assembling all of them into modules that is the integration and evaluation had not been fully completed unipixel never disclosed the integration yield achieved by the development customer in that first trial as of early november there was still no indication by management that there had been a problem with obtaining a product order the month before and that the initial inch design had been cast aside while initial revenues had now been postponed to  the work on the initial tablet design was progressing as usual we continue to benefit from the strong relationship with our tablet customer who understands the challenge of our yield ramp and remains fully engaged we continually discuss our progress to ensure our testing methods will result in high integration yields and we are working with this development customer to plan followon integration trials and prototype delivery schedules november call transcript slide  in the november corporate presentation also reiterated that the company was working the final development of this tablet product the company waited until the analyst day in december to reveal for the first time that a new inch tablet design had been initiated in october instead analyst day presentation slide  the practice of sending samples but never obtaining and fulfilling an actual product order is similar to what transpired in january last year when it became clear that rather than making the expected product deliveries in late  the company had simply provided hundreds of samples and demonstration units to key potential customers but no commercial production orders were shipped january  press release dell is out unipixel ceo told investors that the company was working on too many product designs skus in early  so he picked the small inch tablet sensor to focus the companys development effort needham conference presentation  and slide  but by doing so unipixel effectively reneged on its contract with dell which at that time called for another tablet sensor in february last year jeff tomz unipixels cfo had signed an amended statement of work with dell that stipulated a specific conditional purchase order for a larger inch tablet sensor at least  metal mesh sensors to be delivered no later than june   for the purpose of evaluation by dell the sensors were for intended for dell venue pro  an inch tablet with a detachable keyboard a hybrid codenamed midland or another applicable platform unipixel did not disclose that order last year and did not deliver on it according to the text of the dell agreement as amended the relationship terminated in november last year no further amendments have been filed yet dell is still listed as a current partner in the latest k page  and investors are misled that unipixel will sell significant quantities of intouch touch sensors through this relationship the irony is that unlike dell neither the tablet nor the aio development customer is mentioned or described in the k it is also interesting that dell inserted an antibribery and anticorruption clause in the february amendment which raises questions about the circumstances surrounding the original agreement signed in late  specifically why exactly did unipixel get  million with no apparent obligation in return unipixel did not respond when asked to comment on the status of the dell agreement and the failure to disclose the termination unipixel has made no progress under the agreement with its ecosystem partner intel nasdaqintc either unipixel got another  million two years ago to cover equipment purchases and has not yet recognized it as revenue  it is still a current liability on the balance sheet that agreement is scheduled to expire march next year and it is not entirely clear what would happen then as all interim deadlines were effectively removed by an amendment a year ago yield charts dont match unipixel has a problem the production yields it has reported recently production yield is an important determinant of the manufacturing cost for touch sensors and the companys yield data are conflicting there are three charts showing recent yields measured at the rolltoroll tester in the manufacturing facility operated by kodak kodak is supposed to maintain the yield database manufacturing and supply agreement sections  and  and has been operating the pilot line since the end of august needham conference presentation  the chart on slide  in the analyst day presentation has the yields of individual runs for the period august    november   the chart on slide  in the needham conference presentation applies to the period august    december   the chart on slide  in the march corporate presentation covers only the aio testing and does not show individual runs but what appears to be either an average yield or just one run for each day in the span of three weeks or  consecutive workdays sometime in late february to early march the first two charts both contain the period august    november   but the graphs do not match while the charts dont shows values on the y yield axis the highest yield on the second chart is about  needham conference presentation  and the x axis is assumed to cross the y axis at  using those values as calibration points the data from the first two charts have been extracted with a digitizer tool and plotted on picture  picture  unipixels production yield graphs side by side the data extraction process has an estimated precision of  with the limitation that it cannot identify more than three runs per day and cannot distinguish more than one run for a given yield on the same overall the resulting plot resembles the original lines closely including the linear fit lines the analyst day line simply does not match the needham line in the overlapping period and the discrepancies appear random ranging from none on days like september  to about  on september  only about  of the identified runs have similar yields  when confronted about the mismatch between the charts from the two slides unipixels investor relations first argued that the data were the same in both charts for the common period in a followup unipixels ceo reiterated that the data were the same and sourced from the same database saying that had no idea why microsoft powerpoint graphed it slightly different and then refused further explanation kodak did not reply to a request for comment on the obvious data discrepancies there are two additional issues with these charts that complicate interpretation of the yield data for individual runs and the yield trend over time first reported yields overstate the true ratio of good sensors to total manufactured sensors in the rolls throughout the period according to unipixels ceo the rolltoroll testing equipment has been unable to catch some of the defects identified as microscratching and the company had some escapes through its integration partners needham conference presentation  in other words the company has been shipping sensors that registered as good but were in fact defective as of mid march unipixel was still working on final test optimization march corporate presentation slide  with a thirdparty equipment vendor trying to add a new inspection method needham conference presentation  second there is no information about sensor size line resolution and sensor design from the data points and those all affect the yield for example there were at least three different sensor sizes that unipixel was trying to produce during the period  the inch tablet sensors until october presumably the inch tablet sensors since october and the inch aio sensors since august each with different yield behavior so even if yield appears to have increased in november there is no way to tell from the chart whether there was an actual improvement or whether kodak was simply manufacturing more of the higheryielding sensors similarly making a sensor with micronwide conductive lines is much more difficult than making a sensor with a  or micronwide lines and unipixel had offered a price list for all of these resolutions in the past intel agreement section  finally the sensor design itself affects yield  for example sensors with redundancies in the sensor mesh might have a higher yield but at the expense of diminished sensor transparency poor production yields picture  shows monthly summaries calculated using extracted data from both charts  the median and the average yields with standard deviation bars the number of observations by month were     and  from the needham chart and    and  from the analyst day chart picture  summary yield statistics show little progress there is no apparent upward trend in yields in picture  contrary to management interpretation for example unipixel stated in early november we continue to make progress increasing our average yield as we apply the knowledge gained from and improvements made to the pilot production line november press release however the statistics in picture  and the individual data points from picture  show that average yield was actually decreasing in september and october right until the day before the press release confirming the lack of improvement daniel van ostrand cited manufacturing yield as one of the two challenges of metal mesh sensors in late october about a month after leaving unipixel touch gesture motion conference presentation slide  the positively sloped linear fit lines in picture  are not appropriate statistical indicators of an improving yield trend by extending the trend in both directions the lines inevitably cross  and  implying negative yields prior to some point in the past and yields over  after some point in the future yet yield by definition is bounded between  and  in early january the ceo reiterated that the trend was one of increasing yield even though yields were a little choppy needham conference presentation  he was also encouraged that from november through middle of december unipixel started to see more consistent yield capability that is reduced yield variability true yields suddenly jumped and variability dropped in november but then in december yields were back down to the september levels and yield variability worsened sharply the analyst day attendees would probably be surprised to learn that the live pilot production runs they observed resulted in yields of  and  or  on average on that day based on the extracted data the ceos explanation for the yield variability is not credible according to him it is due to three factors  microscratching trialanderror engineering experiments and then the holidays in the latter part of december needham conference presentation  but microscratching cannot be the culprit  by unipixels own admission the companys automatic rolltoroll tester is still unable to detect microscratching defects and properly measure yield so even if all the sensors in a particular roll were affected by this defect they would still be all counted as good and the yield shown on the chart for the test run would be  instead of  with respect to trialenderror being a factor it is puzzling that unipixel would run drastic experiments on the pilot production line operated by kodak when there were  printing presses and at least  plating lines in the facility and another facility in texas was supposed to be dedicated to rd and process development november call transcript and needham conference presentation  finally the data end in mid december so there simply arent any yield observations from the latter part of december or the holidays in the charts the poor yields and high yield variability are easier to explain by fundamental flaws in unipixels manufacturing process and equipment the company and kodak are attempting to reliably deposit microscopic continuous patterns on both sides of a moving flexible substrate using equipment designed to print bottle labels only micron registration see intel agreement exhibit a they then aim to reliably metalize those patterns using an inherently unstable chemical process mike smith a kodak operations manager with unipixels project tries to explain the twopart sensormaking process while holding the rejected inch tablet sensor apparently oblivious to the irony that the process and its economics may not be fully thought out putting glue on a piece of construction paper and sprinkling sparklies on top is very similar to what goes on here the glue is our ink the sparklies in this part of the process is the metal its a little bit more hightech than that but fundamentally thats what goes on nyt video  the only other competitor that tried to use a process involving creating a catalytic pattern followed by electroless plating was atmel in partnership with cit otcpkccegf caruk unipixel has been a cit licensee in the past atmel was ahead of unipixel by at least two years in both the patterning and metalizing processes because it switched early on from printing to a finer process lithography and always used touchless plating atmel started shipping commercial volumes in  achieved little last year and finally gave up and announced a shutdown of the sensor business in early february the other two metal mesh competitors that have had some success so far mntech korea and ofilm china do not use a separate metalizing process but rely instead on a simple printing process followed by a brief curing period cima nanotechs selfforming metal mesh has also shown promise on the february call unipixels ceo did not present new production yield data but only discussed integration yield instead the new yield chart in unipixels march corporate presentation has been completely redesigned not an unexpected development given that the two previous yield charts do not show unipixel and kodak making the right progress or understanding how to reduce variability and increase the yield needham conference presentation  there is no continuity from the previous two charts  the periods do not overlap the graph has just one point per day instead of individual runs no actual yield values are given and the chart covers only the aio sensor yield one could speculate that each major interval on the y axis corresponds to  implying that the average and median yield in the period were about  with estimated standard deviation of about  that would be an improvement from the results in december but the yield is still below the target of  net yield kodak agreement section  if production yields were that much better than last years unipixel would have put values on the y axis in this new chart moreover measured yields still overstate actual yields as the microscratching test has not been finalized integration yield just as problematic unipixels story about integration yield is also confusing integration or backend yield is the yield experienced by the module integrator while assembling a sensor received from unipixel into a complete touch module and is an important determinant of the competitiveness of unipixels product unipixels ceo reported the achievement of integration yields in the high  percentile with the tablet development partner february press release but in the qa on the call he implied that he meant high integration yields subsequently confirmed by the march corporate presentation page  the ceo a former inspection system applications engineer should have been aware that percentile and percentage have very different meanings a percentile is defined as a value on a scale of  that indicates the percent  of a distribution that is equal to or below it for example if an integration trial with unipixel sensors resulted in a yield in the  percentile that means that among all the yield observations recorded by the module integrator from trials in the past less than  were higher than the yield from the trial with unipixel sensors again as an example if the integration yields observed in the past have been uniformly distributed between  and  a yield of  would be in the  percentile he also claimed on the call that ito film yields are generally lower than the high s implying that unipixel and its development customer should have been very pleased that would come as a surprise to the leading module integrators because their yields were already  by mid  kdb industry report page  module making has been a very competitive costdriven business since late  with gross margins often close to just  even at  yield cs industry report page  meaning selling at about zero gross margin that is at cost when operating at  yield also according to unipixels ceo this was just one integration trial and one sample which makes no sense because one trial can only be associated with just one integration yield  the ratio of the good modules divided by the total number of modules assembled from the sample of sensors used during the trial also the result could not have been a consistent  over that sample as he further elaborated but just one yield data point of  or actually a high  if it were just one trial on the call he also described the integration trial as large with a large number of sensors while in january had only mentioned low volume sampling of intouch sensors to customers for integration needham conference presentation slide  in march kodaks ceo characterized the recent trails as low volume but did describe the integration yields as favorable kodak march call transcript there has been no word from either ceo about what was the integration yield of the tens of inch tablet sensors shipped in july last year  they were all supposed to be assembled into modules august call transcript no progress in the past two years when comparing recent production yields with past disclosures the conclusion is that there has been no measurable progress towards commercialization  yields remains roughly in the same range as in early  robert petcavich unipixels chief technology officer cto together with the former ceo told investors in march  that expected yields would be  and continuing to improve once commercial production were to start within a month or two on the already operational printingplating lines roth conference presentation  and wfg investor call   those yields match the highest measured yields in november and december picture  and commercial production is again just about to start according to management despite repeated reports of progress and breakthroughs in the past year measured yields did not improve in early  actual yields were  on average and the manufacturing process was unreliable  not much different from the average yield of about  and variability of about  in the period august  december  picture  a former unipixel employee a confidential witness for the plaintiffs in the class auction lawsuit that unipixel has agreed to settle has explained the causes of the low yield he testified that until his departure in spring  unipixel was always changing the production process sometimes daily or even twice in a single day because the company could never get it down pat frequent problems included a machine jams and improper plating on the press requiring manual adjustment b even when jams and plating problems were corrected product that looked good was later reported by the client to have a low yield  indeed yields were only  c while larger print samples could be reliably made which were uniform and fully conductive the smaller the pattern size the more likely it was to be nonuniform and have microscopic breaks d the goal of shrinking the pattern size down to the desired level of thinness because everyone knew that the lines were visible and that a moire effect was evident in the larger print remained elusive regardless of materials used e additional testing to catch problems before shipping samples to clients was problematic  as too much testing and handling could cause broken lines and destroy the product and f management had overpromised product on delivery schedules that could not be met and needed to be pushed out the team tweaked the product to reduce errors as the deadline would approach once the product finally looked very good the first production sample would fail case cv  page  all the factors that affected manufacturing yield in early  likely remain  for example improving the sensor optical quality probably still breaks the electrical performance and speeding up production probably still results in an increased number of defects three pilot announcements the achieved technical breakthrough in rolltoroll plating process announced as tremendous progress in june last year was supposed to bring manufacturing from a labbased development to a new level  a fullyfunctional rolltoroll pilot production line yet the next step the start of actual production and transition to commercialization was not reached and yields did not improve which indicates that there was little substance behind the advertised advancement the announcement scheduled earlier that month after intel was informed that production had not started now looks suspiciously like a trick to support the stock price ahead of last augusts shareholder meeting and divert investor attention from several developments that month  the departure of robert berg the liquidation of the entire stake by the largest shareholder of the company destrier capital compare holdings in the proxy with f filing and the failure to deliver the  sensors to dell a review of history shows that this is not the first time unipixel has declared a fullyfunctional rolltoroll pilot production success according to past statements by unipixels cto rolltoroll pilot production was first achieved more than three years ago in march  and then again in february  in march  the cto gave an update about the just completed rolltoroll pilot production runs march  call  we have run pilot production materials at very high rates on a prototype line which has been the rd proving ground for our largescale continuous flow manufacturing process i will be showing  next week  the first rolltoroll uniboss pilot production films uniboss is simply the old brand name of unipixels touch sensors now intouch actual production and commercial shipments were to follow shortly after introducing the uniboss solution in may  we have focused on uniboss development efforts on continuous improvement of materials the processes by which we achieve the highly transparent conductive lines and spaces we expect the next phase of uniboss prototypes to allow oems and their supply chain to qualify the product for one or more commercial opportunities concurrently we are making plans to put in place high speed production equipment we anticipate the equipment will be installed and up and running by july of this year we have already begun installing proprietary manufacturing equipment that can support up to a half a million sqft of film production per eight hour shift over  million in product value at prevailing prices then again nearly two years later he described a fullyfunctional production line ready to commence production in the coming quarter so now the line is actually running were actually running rolltoroll material off the line now we do have a recipe for product that we are bringing off the lines as we speak even this afternoon and we dont see any road blocks to meeting or exceeding that  units per month in april were adding couple of pieces of equipment that are expected to be delivered in a couple of weeks that will amplify that production throughput and that we think the one we know today there is not going to be hiccup or issues with the scale up at least for  units february  call transcript unipixel managed to make and ship a  samples in april that year but they were not accepted by dell and actual production never started touchless like in  another recent milestone touchless plating is supposed to be a major innovative step towards commercialization but is in fact an year old idea the engineering proofofconcept announced on the february call involved converting parts of the web transport system on one of the plating lines from a mechanical roller system to touchless system with further work directed towards a complete upgrade to touchless web handling the noncontact system modification is supposed to bring actual yield closer in line with yield measured at the automatic rolltoroll tester particularly for the tablet sensors chemcut unipixels plating equipment vendor and atotech the plating chemistry vendor are puzzled by the announcement personal communication the intouch rolls are supposed to be doublesided and chemcuts engineers do not currently know of a way to convert their plating line into touchless on both sides only touchless on one side has been done an atotech engineer believes that unipixel and kodak did modify one of the lines by simply taking most of the mechanical rollers out but it is not a complete touchless system he thinks they are also working on another line to make it truly touchless his guess is that they are trying a similar configuration to the one used by cemko an uk plating equipment vendor utilizing fluidic pressure to keep the film up the surface picture  cemkos touchless plating system year  atotech has partnered with both chemcut and cemko but the engineer recommend cemko for a touchless rolltoroll film system cemkos system picture above is very compact and was specifically developed for delicate printed electronics applications in collaboration with cit in  in contrast chemcuts systems are designed primarily for plating rugged printed circuit boards pcbs atmel in partnership with cit had been using cemkos touchless system in volume production of touch sensors for two years until exiting the business in february so it cant be a coincidence that unipixel came up with the touchless milestone just three weeks later a cemko line would have also prevented defects caused by those bubbles stuck on the film and visible on the analyst day video  kodak is of little help kodaks technology was expected to enable unipixel to scale production to meet accelerating demand and begin commercial production in  kodak april  press release but the only tangible benefits to unipixel from kodaks manufacturing agreement appear to be a facility with environmental permits for the plating operation see the harmful liquids warning analyst day video  and kodak sharing half of the project operating expenses kodak agreement section  one other unexpected benefit is that kodak might be authoring unipixels investor presentations see author pdf metadata in march corporate presentation kodak management seem to know surprisingly little about touch sensors kodaks ceo joined the company around the same time unipixels ceo did and like him also lives across the country he is on record saying things like the touch screen sensor business is very large  i reference a  billion annual size to this market  and we are very excited to be in it at production quality at production levels now kodak november call transcript his view is shared by terry taber kodaks cto who in july  expected that the market would grow to over  billion in  years and that demand for kodaks sensors would be extremely high democrat  chromicle july  first video  however the touch sensor market is nowhere close to  billion even unipixels inflated numbers sourced from what are backofthe envelope estimates by displaysearch rather than actual transactional data show the total addressable procap touch sensor market at about  billion march corporate presentation slide  the real addressable market is just a small fraction of that value and while it is still growing in units it is already flat to declining in dollars due to continuous sensor cost reductions moreover neither unipixel nor kingsbury kodaks other partner and direct competitor to unipixel have reached production quality or are ready for production kingsbury is also targeting this quarter for initial commercial shipments but the goal used to be q and then last quarter similar to unipixel kodaks original touch sensor film project based on pedot technology announced in  was expected to result in better performing and cheaper touch sensors but never achieved significant sales kodaks ceo also believes that indium is a rare metal and is an expensive part of the bill of materials of touchscreen devices whattheythink video  but indium is not a rare metal  it is as abundant as cadmium or silver its price is currently close to the price of silver about kg and the actual indium metal content in a regular ito touch sensor amounts to a few milligrams or less than a penny the cost of manufacturing of touch sensors is primarily determined by the yield and length of the production chain and partially by the pattern forming technology not by the initial raw materials used which kodak would have known if it actually had made any touch sensors kodaks ceo is probably not entirely to blame as the arrangements with unipixel and kingsbury and the entire sensor market strategy were conceived and set during the bankruptcy reorganization preceding his tenure for example the agreement with unipixel was likely put together rather hastily  it stipulates on page  that the revenue and profit will be allocated between the parties according to section  of this agreement but section  covers only facility utilization while the revenues and profits are addressed in a subsequent section if the goal were to gain a significant market share and if kodak had a good grasp of the market and costs it makes little economic sense to support three different touch sensor technologies  copper silver halide and pedot kodak should have first tried to pick a cost winner among those and made sure it would be competitive with the sensors already manufactured by the module integrators instead these three technologies compete directly with each other confusing the potential customers for example neither kodak nor unipixel have explained why j touch which kodak and kingsbury announced as a customer early last year does not work with unipixel and is not interested in unipixels copperbased metal mesh technology when both unipixel and kingsbury are trying to make the same touch sensors and kingsbury and kodak have been unable to explain why j touch has never mentioned kingsbury kodak or any silverhalide touch sensors since the initial press release nor has it ordered any commercial quantities so far but had stated in that press release that it offers touch panel solutions utilizing copperbased metal mesh from  to  inches it seems that kodak now intends to keep the touch sensor projects running as long as possible in order to keep investors excited about the imaginary growth opportunity kodak march call transcript kodak operates in mostly dull mature and declining markets with shrinking revenues and negative operating margins so it is tempting for management to try to spark a bit of hope nyt article but that could also backfire for example last august a kodak account manager uploaded a marketing video touting the companys expertise in functional printing and touch sensors not realizing that the video showed a defective unipixel sensor under a microscope see snapshot below after an inquiry to kodak the video quickly disappeared from his youtube account without explanation picture  defective sensor in a kodak video kodak u  redundant sensors unipixel is overstating the potential benefits of its touch sensors for example unipixel claims that its sensors are suitable for all size applications march corporate presentation slide  however unipixels sensors are unsuitable for smartphones the most important application in the touch market in terms of both units and dollars the company still uses pictures of phones to illustrate its sensors and their numerous benefits slide  and slide  and the ceo had touted the significant market potential of unipixels touch sensors for smartphones april press release however since the liolios conference smartphones are no longer included in unipixels addressable market liolios conference presentation slides  and  the ceo admitted in the qa we dont believe that our product is really applicable to the phone market again we are talking about placing the metal mesh on top of the display the pixel size on phones is much smaller so that metal mesh is going to cover up more of the phone pixel and that creates a noise pattern display degradation also the border the bezel pitch is much tighter on phones  we cant address that today with reference to the addressable market unipixel falsely states that the existing touch technology faces unmet customer needs march corporate presentation slide  while there is no perfect touch technology the slide itself illustrates that current itobased and embedded touch sensors meet all customer needs at least the needs that matter picture  existing touch technology meets customer needs for example to show that ito does not scale and is not appropriate for larger displays unipixel is actually using the picture of a huge inch itobased touchenabled aio developed by perceptive pixel now part of microsoft nasdaqmsft and unveiled in  even a inch sensor is beyond unipixels capabilities according to the footnote on the first page of its datasheet unipixel also claims that existing touch technology is inadequate in terms of touch response speed and accuracy and pen enablement but the picture in this section is of dell venue pro  tablet being used with a stylus that popular device actually has a regular ito touch sensor to illustrate that current touch sensors are fickle with poor signaltonoise ratio the company attached a chart of a touch event detected by a regular display without any touch sensor in it that actually shows a very high signaltonoise ratio the chart comes from a study that demonstrated how touch can be detected with the circuitry already present in a regular nontouch lcd display by doing some signal processing on the faint noise transmitted through the power line in effect the study is an endorsement for embedded sensors which also rely on circuitry in the display itself and are rapidly gaining share this year in highvolume applications as they are virtually free finally unipixel is using a picture of three simple resistive not procap itobased modules to argue that the prevailing ito touch technology is too costly however resistive sensors and modules have all but disappeared from high volume applications due to inherent functional drawbacks they are also no longer the lowestcost ito touch sensor option there are similar issues with slide  supposed to illustrate the specific functional advantages of unipixels sensors picture  picture  unipixel sensors are either unsuitable or have no functional advantages the top two photos on the right show the lg korea g flex phone and its bendable display  this was the first flexible phone released commercially in  that is curved designs and flexible touch sensors are already taken care of with existing technology moreover unipixels sensors are unsuitable for smartphones by the ceos own admission the third picture is of a inch touchdisplay with infrared not procap module made by elo and is from a blog post discussing poor usability of multitouch on large displays the other functional advantages in the list on the left in picture  are either irrelevant or misleading it is true that metal mesh and other nonito technologies can have lower resistance but that is no longer an issue with modern touch controllers which enable fast touch response even in large formats many ito sensors for smartphones and tablets are also onesided and ito sensors such as ogs or certain embedded sensors dont require any film unipixels technology has poor optics and inaccurate color rendition because the mesh partially covers certain pixels creating color noise and moiré  that is one of the reasons why it is not suitable for smartphones and highresolution tablets and notebooks the prospect of selling below cost a product with no significant functional advantages is a tough sell in the touch sensor business in contrast to an active market for some touch modules the market for touch sensors is virtually nonexistent very few touch sensors are actually sold and purchased and most are produced internally by module integrators or display manufacturers who are also the potential customers so unless there is some temporary shortage the sensor selling price needs to be well below the customers current internal cost of manufacturing to compensate for the sensor making capacity that would become idle and then the sensors production cost needs to be even lower to allow for a viable product with a sustainable gross margin that is why there are no successful pureplay sensor manufacturers today the companies that have attempted commercial production in the socalled itoalternative space have typically been module manufacturers making the new sensors themselves like ofilm or tpk taiwan or could bundle the sensor with some other component such as a touch controller like atmel or optical film like mntech or could sustain the losses like fujifilm japan the current mainstream capacitive touch solutions  various discrete itobased glass or film sensors made by module integrators and various embedded sensors incell oncell or hybrid made by display manufacturers  are good enough and remain cost competitive with the alternatives offered today such as metal mesh copper silver silver halide silver nanowires cnt pedot and graphene despite the planned commercial launch this quarter unipixel has been reluctant to discuss specific pricing and costs but its poor production yields guarantee that the company is not cost competitive it will have to sell at negative gross margin to generate volume demand for its sensors and drive touch adoption and improve profitability down the product chain march corporate presentation slide  the last time unipixel provided extensive details about its internal model for average selling price and costs was on the november  call in the middle of its price negotiations with intel and dell and during the peak of touch module shortages the company revealed sqft price for its touch sensors at preferred price a  discount vs street pricing of sqft its cost of manufacturing could be modeled at about sqft implied by a gross margin over  that model price and cost structure was similar to atmels and atmel got out of the touch sensor business mainly due to price pressures having initially hoped for  million annual revenues in november  the actual cost of manufacturing of some competitors might have been around sqft indeed and unipixel was implying that cost of regular touch sensors at the time was as high as sqft derived from  for inch module and  discount with unipixels sensor by june  sensors costs had collapsed due to yield improvements and pricing pressures in the touch module market unipixels own sensors were now described only as competitive june call transcript implying they were modeled at a slightly lower price than the cost of regular touch sensors the companys estimate for those came down to sqft that is about th of the original range in late  but still higher than the actual costs at the module integrators or display manufacturers intel does not believe unipixel has a marketleading cost structure march corporate presentation slide  in late  sid published a review article authored by intels senior touch technologist in which he stated that his estimate for metal mesh sensor pricing by the end of  would be around sqft m unipixels ceo stumbled badly when asked to comment about the sqft prospect in the qa at the needham conference presentation  q intel is now saying that metal mesh will be sqft by the end of the year can you compete with that a i dont know how they arrive at sqft i mean we are in discussions  q well they are looking at actual manufacturers of metal mesh and those are telling them that metal mesh will be sqft a yeah so all the surveys that we have done is that touch sensor films or the touch sensors themselves are about m so yeah it is getting close to about sqft q right but this is patterned metal mesh it is not just unpatterned film what we are taking about is sqft of an actual touch sensor a yup of the sensor itself not the module correct q and you think basically that you can compete with that a definitely but in a followup unipixels investor relations replied that the ceo misspoke and he actually meant sqft not m the ceo himself later came up with sqft or  price for a inch sensor citing displaysearch a stunning retreat from being definitely competitive with the sqft number if unipixel were in close contact with intel and did monitor and feed the relationship as claimed june call transcript unipixels ceo should not have been caught by surprise by the view of intels touch expert on pricing prospects in the touch sensor business the stated belief in the latest k that unipixel will sell significant quantities of intouch touch sensors through intels relationship now sounds preposterous it is really too late for unipixel to attempt commercial sales in the tablet and even small notebook sensor segments as the cost of discrete procap sensors has dropped and embedded sensors have started gaining share at about  yield which is unipixels current commercialization target august call transcript the manufacturing cost will be above sqft probably even sqft and over but the actual manufacturing cost of regular procap sensors can be as low as sqft right now embedded sensors are proliferating not just in smartphones but also in larger screen sizes synaptics nasdaqsyna estimates page  that incell sensor technology for example can eliminate up to  of the touch module cost since a regular procap sensor is typically  of the overall module cost depending on configuration kdb industry report pages  an embedded sensor is effectively free for example if the sensor cost is simply taken out of a  regular discrete touch module the module cost will come down to about  but a similar incell module can be as low as  boe is even offering free touch modules for smartphones selling touch displays at the same price as that of nontouch displays of identical size and quality aio touch sensors are not free yet but severe competition has eroded potential profitability even in that small segment unipixel is apparently relying on faulty market research when it claims march corporate presentation slide  that aio sensors represent the fastest growing and most profitable segment with  million addressable market by  while the projected procap unit volumes are likely already overstated the real problem with the dollar value and the entire chart on the right is the implied sensor pricing for example using segment dollar sizes extracted from the chart with a digitizer tool and dividing them by the procap sensor units projected by displaysearch november  touch panel market slide  the average aio procap sensor cost come to about  in   sqft in   and  in  and  those numbers are unrealistic and inflated for three reasons first a  aio sensor cost in  is inconsistent with the  number from the module asp chart for  march corporate presentation slide  also sourced from displaysearch because it implies that a sensor would be more expensive than a module which contains a sensor a flexible cable a controller cover glass and adhesives second the persistent overcapacity in the industry simply does not support increasing sensor costs and the overcapacity may actually be worsening touch notebooks not just tablets are weakening compal taiwan one of the two largest contract manufacturers of notebooks is predicting see also this that traditional touchenabled notebooks will start disappearing by the end of the year while the in tabletnotebook hybrids are unlikely to pick up the slack as embedded sensors have now entered the notebook segment even more discrete sensor manufacturing capacity could spill into the aio segment auo nyseauo for example expects to start mass production of incell touch panels for notebooks in the current quarter third the aio procap sensor market is very limited due to ergonomic issues with touch on large vertical surfaces gorilla arm and due to simple aesthetics distracting fingerprints and smudges unit shipments are estimated at  million in  and  november  touch panel market slide  almost all itoalternative competitors over  are now targeting this segment and pressuring prices down the companies with other technologies that still hold a significant share in the aio segment such as optical and infrared are also trying to defend their turf a coat that is hard to sell in february unipixel announced that it had received its first purchase order for two gallon barrels of diamond guard resin to be used in a film coating trial and had already shipped it february call transcript according to unipixel the resin shipment generated revenue but the selling price was not set as of mid march commercial shipments were expected to start this quarter march corporate presentation slide  the film manufacturing partner for diamond guard listed in the latest k is carestream but the following language found in the  k has been removed they will support the manufacturing warehousing and sales of our protective cover film line of products last year carestream announced its own proprietary hardcoat formulation it is supposed to provide scratch and abrasion resistance targeting essentially all unipixels intended markets such as touchscreens flat panels membrane switches decorative graphics and white boards march corporate presentation slide  when carestream was asked recently to explain how this product is not a direct competitor to diamond guard the company only replied that the product targets different markets entirely and declined to comment on its relationship with unipixel incidentally carestream has also been competing with unipixel in touch sensors developing a silvernanowires solution since  the sale announced in february is not unipixels first shipment of diamond guard for film applications in q  unipixel reported that it had fulfilled a number of purchase orders for diamond guard hard coat film submitted by major electronic oems odms and film converters that are advancing product designs which take advantage of diamond guards unique characteristics at the time unipixel was marketing hardcoated film as supposed to just the resin but like the recent shipment those were only test level runs as explained on the call unipixel recognized about  in revenues that quarter but those were no product revenues as no cost of sales was reported earlier in march  the company had signed an agreement with carestream for the manufacture and distribution of the coated film and had received the first purchase orders for test piloting purposes in july the company announced productionlevel qualification and capacity of over  million sqftyear to support largescale volume production corresponding to over  million in potential revenues roth conference presentation  fullsize purchase orders and shipments were expected later that quarter but they never happened  the excuse offered by the cto and the former ceo was that a hardcoat was a difficult technical sale with customers having complex specifications and integration steps and that the ramp of diamond guard would take time november  call  based on the sparse technical and marketing information about diamond guard available publicly it is an acrylicbased hardcoat resin that makes it a commodity product readily available from numerous suppliers companies like sartomer akefrance and allnex for example are happy to supply the components and suggest specific formulations that would best fit the customer requirements for example both companies suggest various options with a urethane acrylate base for about  a gallon for a transparent uvcurable acrylic hardcoat resin for coating pet film to h pencil hardness personal communication so the value of unipixels diamond guard shipment in january should be about  and if the product is ever sold commercially it would be at cost or a singledigit gross margin at best many vendors including companies with marketing prowess and large customer base have attempted to push cover glass replacements with much better specs than diamond guard since at least  but have achieved little commercial success in mainstream applications for example an overview of the  finetech japan expo slide  lists products from four different exhibitors including cover sheets with h hardness by dai nippon printing co ltd japan press release and nippon steel sumitomo metals chemistry datasheet both announced in  separately mntech has had its h taf in the window of the s view novelty cover case for certain samsung korea phones since  but it is a lowvolume application unipixels own documents show why there is little demand for diamond guard even if sold at cost for example picture  annotates the slide that supposedly illustrates three types of applications for the resin march corporate presentation slide  picture  diamond guard is unnecessary however metadata in the pictures reveals that the broken glass of the iphone  shown there was actually replaced by glass the picture comes from ads for glass replacement services glass was used because hardcoated plastic simply cannot provide enough strength and support to protect the display of a mobile device and is too easily scratched by a pen coins keys sand and even glass apple would have switched to a plastic screen for the iphone  released in late  if diamond guard or similar hardcoats were any good compared to glass the picture that supposedly illustrates protective films and case parts was taken in   again demand must be low since there have been no commercial sales of diamond guard in the past three years the last picture is of an akzonobel akzanetherlands product a polyvinylidene difluoride cast film aimed at replacing mechanically brushed decorative metals and has nothing to do with the acrylic diamond guard similarly the picture on the next slide slide  is of a samsung galaxy phone taken in  and samsung still uses glass for all of its mobile devices none of the arguments listed on the slide about the benefits of diamond guard and the need for elimination of glass in cover lens assembly are valid corning nyseglws gorilla glass and similar products offered by other glass companies are very difficult to shatter are inexpensive can be very thin and light protect the display extremely well and are actually scratch resistant unlike plastic surfaces coated with diamond guard slide  is also misleading for example it states that the minimum effective thickness for glass is mm as compared to mm for diamond guard film that is simply not true willow glass cornings flexible but tough glass is available in mm thickness schotts ultrathin glass can be as thin as mm the cash runs out in  were definitely on the right track unipixels ceo told investors just ahead of the upcoming shareholder meeting in august last year he meant production revenues in  but that marker was not reached it has been the same track that leads to persistent cash drain of about  million a quarter and repeated commercialization delays the company is about to miss its product launch target again has failed to receive an order for last years tablet sensor and has a hard time measuring and improving yields its technology is now redundant due to declining cost and increased performance of regular ito and embedded touch solutions even if the company were to start volume shipments eventually it will have to sell at a loss as the trend persists the cash should run out by the end of next year or even sooner if management comes up with an excuse to accelerate capital spending such as building or buying a touchless system a new equity round may be in the works despite repeated denials by the company unipixels story told by management is fiction but successive ceos with the approval of the board of directors have been able to repeat it for years and raise millions because there have been no adverse consequences the recent class action lawsuit is about to be settled for a fraction of the losses incurred by investors who participated in the  equity financing the sec has been investigating since  sending at least three letters to the company recently and the only tangible outcome so far has been a filing of a ka amendment for  which finally disclosed information that should have been disclosed in  and  but there have been no penalties unipixels directors must feel pretty relaxed if carl yankowski who said that touch sensors are made of indium titanium oxide and promised commercial revenues to ramp in q last year february  call is still eager to go on cnbc and pitch the company as disruptive and innovative kodak the manufacturing partner with declining revenues and ongoing losses is still playing along and paying half of the operating expenses while running unipixels inadequate equipment and halfbaked processes just so it can pretend that it is developing breakthrough technologies unipixels equity investors face a dilemma the best course of action for the long term should be to liquidate the company immediately and distribute the cash to shareholders before it is gone but short term trumps long term  the market cap is about  million right now compared to cash level of about  million fueled by promises of imminent commercial launches and vast addressable markets so the incentive is to wait it out as long as possible trading around bouts of excitement short covering and portfolio rebalancing effects and hoping to get out before the eventual collapse of the stock price such a course of action suits management and the board perfectly as they will continue to receive salaries and stock until the cash is gone disclosure the author is short unxl kodk the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their
