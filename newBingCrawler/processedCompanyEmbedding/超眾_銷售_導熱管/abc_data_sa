ios      – constituting a 0 increase it is important to note that if segmented results are expected from the ab test the test should be properly designed at the outset to be evenly distributed across key customer attributes such as gender that is the test should both a contain a representative sample of men vs women and b assign men and women randomly to each “variant” variant a vs variant b failure to do so could lead to experiment bias and inaccurate conclusions to be drawn from the test this segmentation and targeting approach can be further generalized to include multiple customer attributes rather than a single customer attribute – for example customers age and gender – to identify more nuanced patterns that may exist in the test results acceptanceedit many companies use the designed experiment approach to making marketing decisions with the expectation that relevant sample results can improve positive conversion results it is an increasingly common practice as the tools and expertise grows in this area there are many ab testing case studies which show that the practice of testing is increasingly becoming popular with small and mediumsized businesses as well see
