surge incorporated on june   is a supplier of electronic products and components the companys products include capacitors which are electrical energy storage devices and discrete components such as semiconductor rectifiers transistors and diodes which are single function low power semiconductor products that are packaged alone as compared to integrated circuits such as microprocessors the products that the company sells are utilized in the electronic circuitry of products including automobiles telecomm audio cellular telephones computers consumer electronics garage door openers household appliances power supplies and security equipment the products that the company sells are sold to both original equipment manufacturers oems and to distributors of the lines of products it sellssurge supplies a range of electronic components which can be divided into approximately two categories including capacitors and discrete components the company sells under the name of the manufacturer lelon electronics aluminum electrolytic capacitors which are capacitors that store and release energy into a circuit incrementally and are used in various applications including computers appliances automotive lighting telecommunications devices and various consumer productscapacitorsthe product line of capacitors the company sells include aluminum electrolytic capacitors ceramic capacitors and mylar film capacitors aluminum electrolytic capacitors which are surges principal product are storage devices used in power applications to store and release energy as the electronic circuitry demands they are used in power supplies ceramic capacitors are used in the electronics industry they are used to bypass or filter semiconductors in resonant circuits and are found in a range of products including computer telecom appliances games and toys mylar film capacitors are used for noise suppression and filtering they are used in telecommunication and computer productsdiscrete componentsthe discrete components such as semiconductor rectifiers transistors and diodes are packaged individually to perform a single or limited function in contrast to integrated circuits such as microprocessors and other chips which contain from only a few diodes to as many as several million diodes and other elements in a single package and are designed to perform complex tasks the product line of discrete components the company sells includes rectifiers transistors diodes circuit protection devices and audible components low power semiconductor rectifiers are devices that convert alternating current ac power into one directional current dc power by permitting current to flow in one direction only transistors send a signal to the circuit for transmission of waves they are used in applications involving the processing or amplification of electric current and electric signals including data television sound and power diodes are twolead or surface mount components that allow electric current to flow in only one direction the companys circuit protection devices include transient voltage suppressors and metal oxide varistors which protect circuits against switching lightning surges and other uncontrolled power surges andor interruptions in circuits audible components include audible transducers piezo buzzers speakers and microphones which produce an audible sound for and are used in backup power supplies for computers alarms appliances smoke detectors automobiles telephones and other products which produce sounds its new products include fuses printed
