commercially viable but that cobasys refuses to sell or license them to small companies or individuals boschert argues that cobasys accepts only very large orders for these batteries when boschert conducted her research major auto makers showed little interest in large orders for largeformat nimh batteries however toyota employees complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format nimh batteries to service the existing  ravevs because no other companies were willing to make large orders cobasys was not manufacturing nor licensing any large format nimh battery technology for automotive purposes boschert concludes that its possible that cobasys chevron is squelching all access to large nimh batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline or its possible that cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plugin hybrids or electric vehicles in an interview

spent m cleaning up the area during the s in  the ecuadorean government signed an agreement with texaco accepting the cleanup as complete and absolving texaco of any further responsibility that same year an ecuadorean scientific team took water and soil samples after texaco left and found petroleum hydrocarbons at unsafe levels in almost half the clean up was called a sham by criticswho in  a class action lawsuit against chevron was filed in ecuadorian court for  billion by indigenous residents who accused texaco of making residents ill and damaging forests and rivers by discharging  billion us gallons  m of formation water into the amazon rainforest without any environmental remediation chevron said that the company had completed cleanup of the pollution caused by texaco that current pollution was the result of activities of the ecuadorian oil interests and that the  agreements with the ecuadorian government exempted the company from any liabilities in  ecuadorian residents were awarded  billion based on claims of loss of crops and farm animals as well as increased local cancer rates the plaintiffs said this would not be enough to make up for the damage caused by the oil company the award was later revised to  billion on appeals which was then appealed again to the ecuadorean national court of justice the action has been called the first time that indigenous people have successfully sued a multinational corporation in the country where the pollution took place chevron described the lawsuit as an extortion scheme and refused to pay the fine in november  the international arbitration tribunal issued a partial award in favour of chevron and its subsidiary texaco petroleum company the tribunal has found chevron is not liable for environmental claims in ecuador in march  a united states district court judge ruled that the ecuadorian plaintiff’s lead attorney steven donziger had used “corrupt means” including coercion bribery money laundering and other misconduct to obtain the  court verdict in ecuador the judge did not rule on the underlying issue of environmental damages while the us ruling does not affect the decision of the court in ecuador it has blocked efforts to collect damages from chevron in us courts donziger has appealed in april  amazonwatch released videos reportedly sent from a whistleblower inside chevron the videos purportedly show employees and consultants finding petroleum contamination at sites in the ecuadorean amazon that the company claimed was cleaned up years earlier these videos were confirmed as legitimate by chevron legal counsel according to the company the videos show routine testing to establish the perimeter of oil pits the company further stated that it is not possible to determine from the videos whether the sites shown are the responsibility of chevron or its former partner petroecuador according to amazon watch the videos contain a map confirming that the sites are chevrons and

in  cobasys was a  joint venture between californiabased chevron corporation and michiganbased energy conversion devices inc also called ecd ovonics ecd or ovonics the intermediary hierarchy of ownership was that cobasys llc was owned by chevrons subsidiary chevron technology ventures llc and ecd ovonics subsidiary ovonic battery company cobasys spent  million in funding from chevron technology ventures and the two owners were unable to agree on further funding of the company after arbitration between the owners had stalled a buyer was found on july   the sale of cobasys to sb limotive co ltd an electric vehicle battery joint venture between samsung sdi co ltd and robert bosch gmbh was announced sherry boschert accused chevron of limiting access to large nimh batteries through its stake in cobasys corporation and control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline cobasys filed a patent infringement lawsuit against panasonic and toyota over production of the ev battery used in the rav ev the case was settled with each company granting the other a license to its patents in her book plugin hybrids the cars that will recharge america published in february  sherry boschert argues that largeformat nimh batteries are commercially viable but that cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals boschert argues that cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for largeformat nimh batteries however toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format nimh batteries to service the existing  ravevs because no other companies were willing to place large orders cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format nimh battery technology for automobiles boschert concludes that its possible that cobasys chevron is squelching all access to large nimh batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline or its possible that cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plugin hybrids or electric vehicles in an interview with the economist the ecd ovonics founder stan ovshinsky disagreed stating cobasys isnt preventing anything cobasys just needs an infusion of cash they build a great battery in october  international acquisitions services and innovative transportation systems filed suit against cobasys and its parents for failure to fill an order for largeformat nimh

janeiroedit further information energy in brazil on november   chevron came under fire by brazilian authorities for its role in the spill of crude oil off of the southeastern coast of brazil the brazilian regulators said  liters of oil leaked over the course of two weeks from undersea rock near the well in the frade oil project  km off the brazilian coast prosecutors in brazil initially demanded bn in the subsequent lawsuit the national petroleum agency anp suspended chevrons activities in brazil until it identified the cause of an oil spill off the coast of rio de janeiro the national petroleum agency later concluded that the spill did not cause significant economic damage injured no one and never approached brazils coast criminal charges were dropped and the lawsuits were settled for a total of  million ks endeavor explosionedit the ks endeavor jackup rig exploded on january   while drilling an exploration well for chevron in the funiwa field in nigeria the explosion resulted in the death of two of the  workers on board and a fire that burned for  days before the well was sealed on june  according to a reuters news report workers on the ks endeavor were ignored by chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole a senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive buildup of pressure a witness said that rig engineers advised chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but chevron told them to continue with drilling expecting an explosion the rig manager one of the two that later died kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use a witness reported this is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware that it was going to happen but just didnt know when in an email response to reuters chevron said it did not receive requests to evacuate the rig and that staff on board had the right to call a halt to work if they believed conditions were unsafe forest fire in lawachara national park bangladeshedit on june   a forest fire broke out in lawachara national park bangladesh while chevron was carrying out a d seismic survey chevron stated that it was not conducting activities in the area in which the fire broke out polish gas explorationedit chevron has experienced protests aimed at the company by local communities in southern poland when they started gas exploration in the region their complaint is that chevron didnt provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in poland and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders the landholders of the region view chevrons presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region as well potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers another of the residents primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking in response to some of the protests chevron has sued some of the protesters from żurawlów for disrupting their operations according to gas and oil expert andrzej szczesniak one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between polish and american law in the usa property owners typically receive  from the income of gas exploration in poland the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue this is the result of outdated communist era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if they can get a kick back from a larger company argentina agreement and protestsedit after the  decision of the argentine government to regain control of the biggest oil company of the country ypf the search for foreign investors for exploitation of unconventional oil started finally in  ypf and chevron signed an agreement for the vaca muerta oil field the world’s secondlargest shale gas deposit in august  the congress of neuquén province approved the agreement while between  and  workers students and indigenous people protested outside the legislature police fired rubber bullets hitting some protesters governor jorge sapag defended the police actions “the march was generally peaceful but about  people separated from the rest and attacked the police the police acted with seriousness and professionalism” public eye lifetime awardedit in  chevron received the lifetime award of the public eye on davos for what the sponsors called chevrons responsibility for environmental disaster in the amazon the same group cited the company in  in the category environment for oil soiling in the amazonas in ecuador a chevron spokesperson commented that the award was nothing more than a stunt to distract attention from the fact that the lawsuit against chevron in ecuador has been proven to be meritless and the product of unprecedented fraud and pointed to a us court finding that the plaintiffs lawyers had committed mail and wire fraud money laundering witness tampering and obstruction of justice  that controversial rico case is under appeal and has been criticized by environmental and human rights groups global warmingedit in a letter chevron corp argued that under current disclosure rules
