honeywell process solutions hps today announced that its technology will help improve operations for chinas longdistance guangxi liquefied natural gas lng highpressure pipeline a key strategic project of sinopec limited and guangxi zhuang autonomous region the guangxi lng pipeline will play a critical role in optimizing chinas energy structure and meeting the demand for natural gas in guangxi the project will use hps gas measurement and equipment and software to measure the flow and pressure in the pipeline we are able to draw upon our experience in longdistance natural gas highpressure pipelines to provide expertise to this essential clean energy project said aldous wong hps vice president greater china pipelines have challenges that are very different from processing plants since you have to manage an operation that is hundreds or sometimes thousands of miles long measurements such as flow and pressure must be accurate and immediately accessible to keep the pipeline operating most efficiently the pipeline should be completed later this year and will have a capacity of  billion cubic meters of lng a year and a total length of more than  miles from maoming to beihai in the guangxi region this pipeline will be part of a network that transports natural gas and lng from as far away as kazakhstan to china hps technology is already being used on all three of the mile central asia to china pipelines as well as the mile west to east ii pipeline across china the integrated gas measurement technologies provided by honeywell includes computer software and sensors that measure flow temperature pressure and other indicators that are critical to maintain optimum performance throughout the entire longdistance pipeline these include  ultrasonic flowmeters which measure natural gas for custody transfer applications which require high reliability excellent metering certainty and repeatability  flow computers which can perform parallel calculations of compressibility according to all established methods including gerg  s aga  and aga nx   smartliner temperature and pressure transmitters which are the industrys first modular and most reliable transmitter which deliver value across the entire plant lifecycle these transmitters reduce initial purchasing costs provide flexibility for post startup modifications and reduce maintenance and inventory costs while providing high

than  billion on information security  more than they have ever spent before according to gartner group figures yet the incidence of major data breaches shows no signs of abating as enterprises continue to struggle with online attacks and data leaks many are asking one common question what are we doing wrong the  black hat attendee survey revealed that most en terprises are not spending their time bud get and staffing resources on the problems that most security professionals consider to be the greatest threats a troubling disparity between priorities and actual resources the survey revealed a significant gap between the top concerns that keep security professionals awake at night compared to the tasks that keep them occupied during the day for example  sophisticated targeted attacks  of respondents indicated attacks targeted directly at their organization as their greatest concern however only  indicated that mitigating these attacks were among the top three security spending priorities in their organization further only  said targeted attacks were among the top three tasks they spend the most time on daytoday  social engineering at  the second greatest concern was phishing social network exploits or other forms of social engineering yet only  indicated their organization spends a large portion of their security budget here and only  indicated that they spend a large amount of their time on social engineering if not on their top concerns for the business where are security professionals spending their time  more than a third of black hat attendees said that their most timeconsuming tasks are in addressing vulnerabilities introduced by internally developed software  and vulnerabilities introduced by offtheshelf software  the data suggest that application flaws across the enterprise consume a great deal of time for the it staff yet are seldom considered the greatest threats warning to the industry serious shortage of it security resources and staffing nearly three quarters  of respondents think it is likely that their organizations will have to deal with a major data breach in the year ahead a key reason for security professionals con cerns about future attacks is the shortage of resources that they feel in their own orga nizations  staffing shortage only  of respondents said they feel their organization has enough staff to de fend itself against current threats  measly budgets only onethird  said their organization has enough budget to defend itself against cur rent threats  in need of training while  said they have the skills they need to do their jobs some  said they could use some training the combina tion of these responses should serve as a warning to the industry that security defense strategies and resources need serious re thinking and that the protectors of the enterprise are not confident in their ability to keep adversaries out of systems and data download the full research report the survey results indicate a pressing and immediate need to re think the current enterprise it security model top concerns are changing  and the structure of resources staffing and budget should follow suit for
