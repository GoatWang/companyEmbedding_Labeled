of nxgh and nxtgn inc a subsidiary of nxgh versus defendant viber media inc  the litigation being heard in new york southern district court asserts that viber misused confidential information that the plaintiffs communicated to viber pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement publicly available documents show that on march   district judge richard j sullivan denied vibers motion to dismiss on three of the four claims in the lawsuit in any lawsuit the outcome is always pure speculation but next group holdings intends to share any net proceeds from a favorable ruling with its shareholders this is

last accessed june   what dividend stocks does warren buffett own after taking a look at warren buffett’s portfolio list you can see that there are some very familiar names for dividend investors in fact among the  berkshire hathaway companies  pay a dividend now let’s take a look at some of the notable ones that were recently added to berkshire’s portfolio  inclusions and reductions of dividendpaying companies apple inc the “oracle of omaha” is not known for investing in tech companies but today buffett owns nearly  billion worth of apple inc nasdaqaapl headquartered in cupertino california apple designs develops and sells consumer electronics software and online services right now its biggest revenue contributor is the “iphone” in the tech sector hardware device makers are not known as the most solid businesses for instance blackberry ltd nasdaqbbry which was once apple’s biggest competitor just saw its market share drop to literally zero source “gartner says worldwide sales of smartphones grew  percent in the fourth quarter of ” gartner inc february   however buffett sees something special in apple stock about a year ago investors surprisingly learned that berkshire bought  million shares of apple stock with a value of approximately  billion at the time source “form f information table” united states securities and exchange commission may   and that was just the start since then buffet has increased his stake in the iphone maker to  million shares apple stock is now one of the top berkshire holdings in an interview with cnbc buffett explained why he liked the company “apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it” he said source “billionaire warren buffett more than doubled his holdings in apple in ” cnbc february   apple is also a dividend stock the company currently pays quarterly dividends of  per share translating to an annual dividend yield of  southwest airlines co buffett’s investments in airline stocks last year also came as a surprise this is because he once called his previous investment in the industry a “mistake” “if i get the urge to invest in airlines i call an  number and i say hello my name is warren and i’m an airoholic” the oracle of omaha said in  “sometimes it takes them  minutes to talk me out of it sometimes more” source “berkshire bets on airlines with stakes in american delta” bloomberg november   but things have changed buffett first disclosed his stake in southwest airlines co nyseluv in november  according to berkshire’s latest f filing to the us securities and exchange commission sec the billionaire investor increased his stake in southwest airlines by  in the first quarter of this year southwest airlines is a dividendpaying company currently yielding  the company has raised its quarterly dividend rate in each of the last five years source “dividend  stock split history” southwest airlines co last accessed june   american airlines group inc american airlines group inc nasdaqaal is another buffett airline stock last november berkshire revealed that it owned approximately  million shares of aal stock by the end of march buffett’s stake in the fort worth texasbased airline holding company has increased to nearly  million shares aal stock pays quarterly dividends of  per share at today’s price that gives it an annual dividend yield of  industry consolidation may be one of the reasons behind buffett’s interest in airline stocks in recent years mergers in the us airline industry have reduced the number of major carriers from nine to four and because the airline industry has high barriers to entry it has essentially become an oligopoly protecting existing companies’ profits from potential entrants bank of new york mellon corp companies with entrenched positions in slowchanging industries don’t usually make headlines but some of them such as banks can be solid longterm investments think about it to start a bank you would need to raise a significant amount of capital and convince customers who are already with other banks to switch in other words there are high barriers to entry bank of new york mellon corp nysebk is one of the oldest banks in america with a history that can be tracked back to  today it is a global investment company providing services in  countries and more than  markets by the end of march the bank had  trillion in assets under management the bank pays quarterly dividends with an annual yield of  buffett has owned bank of new york mellon stock for quite some time however his latest f filing showed that in the first quarter berkshire increased its position in bk stock by  with  million shares buffett’s stake in this bank stock is currently worth  billion international business machines corp while buffett is known for his buyandhold strategy it doesn’t mean all of berkshire’s stocks will have a “forever” holding period for instance buffett recently told cnbc that he said sold quite a few shares of international business machines corp nyseibm ibm is one of the few tech stocks that pay generous dividends and it is currently yielding  buffett started buying ibm shares six years ago and by the end of  he has accumulated  million shares of the company however during a recent interview buffett said “i don’t value ibm the same way that i did six years ago when i started buying… i’ve revalued it somewhat downward” he added that the company has run into “some pretty tough competitors” and that he has sold off about a third of his stake in the first and second quarters source “warren buffett has sold ibm shares and ‘revalued’ tech icon downward cites ‘big strong competitors’” cnbc may   twentyfirst century fox inc another company that berkshire sold shares of was twentyfirst century fox inc nasdaqfoxa in fact fox is no longer on the list of companies owned by berkshire hathaway as buffett sold all of his nearly  million shares in the first quarter of  what railroad stocks does warren buffett own warren buffett always liked railroad stocks but the largest railroad company he owns right now will not be found in the list of warren buffett stock picks and that’s because berkshire has already acquired the company so it is no longer trading separately the company in question is burlington northern santa fe llc the secondlargest us railroad company with over  locomotives and  route miles it ships freight throughout the western twothirds of the united states burlington northern santa fe corp is now one of berkshire hathaway’s subsidiaries final thoughts on warren buffett’s portfolio other than looking through warren buffett’s investments list investors can also learn from buffett’s annual shareholders letters they are freely available from berkshire’s web site and can provide valuable insights into the legendary investor’s decisionmaking process don’t forget that you can also invest directly in berkshire the company has two class of shares berkshire hathaway stock class a nysebrka and berkshire hathaway stock class b nysebrkb given that class a shares trade at over  apiece while class b stock is currently priced at around  retail investors will likely consider class b but of course with a lower price berkshire’s class b shares also carry correspondingly lower voting rights for further reading on this topic you can check out
