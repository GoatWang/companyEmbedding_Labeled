researchers say the oil and dispersant mixture including pahs permeated the food chain through zooplankton in  it was reported that dolphins and other marine life continued to die in record numbers with infant dolphins dying at six times the normal rate and half the dolphins examined in a december  study were seriously ill or dying bp said the report was “inconclusive as to any causation associated with the spill in october  al jazeera reported that the gulf ecosystem was in crisis citing a decline in seafood catches as well as deformities and lesions found in fish in louisiana  million pounds of oily material was removed from the beaches in  over double the amount collected in  oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on  miles of louisiana shoreline throughout  oil continued to be found as far from the macondo site as the florida panhandle where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand researchers looking at sediment seawater biota and seafood found toxic compounds in high concentrations that they said was due to the added oil and dispersants although gulf fisheries recovered in  a  study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna by researchers at stanford university and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration published in the journal science found that toxins released by the oil spill sent fish into cardiac arrest the study found that even very low concentrations of crude oil can slow the pace of fish heartbeats bp disputed the study which was conducted as part of the federal natural resource damage assessment process required by the oil pollution act the study also found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than fresh oil another peerreviewed study released in march  and conducted by  scientists from the united states and australia and published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs bp responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the gulf but the new york times reported that the bp statement was contradicted by the study in february  a study from university of south florida researchers showed the possibility that subsurface oil particles from deepwater horizon had traveled underwater as far south as sanibel florida and reached the west florida shelf computer models showed the possibility of subsurface currents delivering oil to the surface in an upwelling off the florida shelf fish along the way were found to have diseased livers from filtering hydrocarbons chemically similar to oil from deepwater horizon causing them immune system problems the team concluded the transport of subsurface hydrocarbonsis both plausible and consistent with the observed distribution of fish lesions fish liver chemistry and other chemical and ecological evidence oil particles buried in gulf sediment could remain there for  years effects on human healthedit research discussed at a  conference included preliminary results of an ongoing study being done by the national institute for environmental health sciences indicating that oil spill cleanup workers carry biomarkers of chemicals contained in the spilled oil and the dispersants used a separate study is following the health issues of women and children affected by the spill several studies found that a significant percentage of gulf residents reported mental health problems such as anxiety depression and ptsd according to a columbia university study investigating the health effects among children living less than  miles from the coast more than a third of the parents report physical or mental health symptoms among their children australias  minutes reported that people living along the gulf coast were becoming sick from the mixture of corexit and oil susan shaw of the deepwater horizon oil spill strategic sciences working group says bp told the public that corexit was as harmless as dawn dishwashing liquidbut bp and the epa clearly knew about the toxicity of the corexit long before this spill according to shaw bps own safety sheet on corexit says that there are high and immediate human health hazards cleanup workers were not provided safety equipment by the company and the safety manuals were rarely if ever followed or distributed to workers according to a newsweek investigation the safety manuals read avoid breathing vapor and wear suitable protective clothing oil clean up workers reported that they were not allowed to use respirators and that their jobs were threatened if they did a peerreviewed study published in the american journal of medicine reported significantly altered blood profiles of individuals exposed to the spilled oil and dispersants that put them at increased risk of developing liver cancer leukemia and other disorders bp disputed its methodology and said other studies supported its position that dispersants did not create a danger to health in  a study was published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences which found heart deformities in fish exposed to oil from the spill the researchers said that their results probably apply to humans as well as fish criminal prosecutionsedit on  march  the us department of justice formed the deepwater horizon task force to consolidate several federal agencies investigations into possible criminal charges stemming the explosion and spill on  november  the doj announced that bp and the doj had reached a  billion settlement of all federal criminal charges related to the explosion and spill the largest of its kind in us history under the settlement bp agreed to plead guilty to  felony counts of manslaughter two misdemeanors and a felony count of lying to congress and agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics bp also paid  million to settle civil charges by the securities and exchange commission that it misled investors about the flow rate of oil from the well as part of the announcement of the settlement bp said it was increasing its reserve for a trust fund to pay costs and claims related to the spill to about  billion on the same day the us government filed criminal charges against three bp employees two site managers were charged with manslaughter and negligence and one former vice president with obstruction near the end of november  the us government temporarily banned bp from bidding any new federal contracts citing the company’s “lack of business integrity”  as of february  criminal and civil settlements and payments to the trust fund had cost the company  billion bp sued to have the  ban lifted and in march  bp and the us environmental protection agency reached an agreement to lift the ban bps ability to bid for leases is conditional on it meeting new ethical and corporate governance standards as well as complying with safety procedures a code of conduct for officers and showing zero tolerance for retaliation against whistleblowers among its employees and contractors environmental and consumer groups attacked the lifting of the ban as unwarranted public citizen said it “lets a corporate felon and repeat offender off the hook for its crimes against people and the environment” justice department suitedit on  december  the us department of justice filed a civil and criminal suit against bp and other defendants for violations under the clean water act in the us district court for the eastern district of louisiana the case was consolidated with about  others including those brought by state governments individuals and companies under multidistrict litigation docket mdl no  before us district judge carl barbier the justice department contends that bp committed gross negligence and willful misconduct which bp contests and is seeking the stiffest penalties possible the case was carefully watched because a ruling of gross negligence would result in a fourfold increase in clean water act penalties which would cause the penalties to reach approximately  billion and would increase damages in the other suits as well any fines from gross negligence would hit bps bottom line very hard because they would not be taxdeductible the company paid no federal income tax to the us government in  because of deductions related to the spill the consolidated trials first phase began on  february  to determine the liability of bp transocean halliburton and other companies and to determine whether the companies acted with gross negligence and willful misconduct the second phase began on  september  and focused on the how much oil spilled into the gulf and who was responsible for stopping it the third phase set to begin in january  will focus on all other liability that occurred in the process of oil spill cleanup and containment issues including the use of dispersants test jury trials will follow to determine actual damage amounts on  september  judge barbier ruled in the first phase of the case that bp had committed gross negligence he rejected bps assertion that other parties were equally responsible for the oil spill and ruled that its employees took risks that led to the largest environmental disaster in us history barbier found that bp was reckless while the other two defendants transocean ltd and halliburton co were negligent and bore less responsibility for the spill he apportioned fault at  for bp  for transocean and  for halliburton barbier ruled that bp had acted with conscious disregard of known risks bp strongly disagreed with the ruling and filed an immediate appeal on july   bp and five states announced an  billion settlement to be used for clean water act penalties and various claims civil proceedings and claims settlementedit in june  after a meeting in the white house between president barack obama and bp executives the president announced that bp would pay  billion into a trust fund that will be used to compensate victims of the oil spill the fund would not supersede individual or states rights for future claims bp also set aside  million to compensate oil workers who lost their jobs because of the spill the fund known as the gulf coast claims facility gccf was administered by attorney kenneth feinberg until it was succeeded by a court supervised settlement program in june  in january  a panel of the us fifth circuit court of appeals rejected an effort by bp to curb payment of what bp claimed to be fictitious and absurd claims to the settlement fund for businesses and persons affected by the oil spill bp said administration of the settlement fund was marred by the fact that people without actual damages could file a claim the court ruled that bp hadnt explained how this court or the district court should identify or even discern the existence of claimants that have suffered no cognizable injury  on  march  bp and businesses and residents affected by the spill reached a settlement of roughly  suits claiming economic losses bp had projected that its settlement costs would be  billion as of late october  it had boosted this estimate to  billion and said it could be significantly higher  political influenceedit release of lockerbie bomberedit bp lobbied the british government to conclude a prisonertransfer agreement which the libyan government had wanted to secure the release of abdelbaset almegrahi the only person convicted for the  lockerbie bombing over scotland which killed  people bp stated that it pressed for the conclusion of prisoner transfer agreement amid fears that delays would damage its commercial interests and disrupt its £ million offshore drilling operations in the region but it said that it had not been involved in negotiations concerning the release of megrahi political contributions and lobbyingedit according to the center for responsive politics bp was the united states thlargest donorwhen to political campaigns having contributed more than us million since   and  of which went to republican and democratic recipients respectively  went to other parties or nonpartisan candidates in february  bps thenchief executive lord browne of madingley renounced the practice of corporate campaign contributions saying thats why weve decided as a global policy that from now on we will make no political contributions from corporate funds anywhere in the world when the washington post reported in june  that bp north america donated at least  million in corporate contributions in the past seven years to political groups partisan organizations and campaigns engaged in federal and state elections mostly to oppose ballot measures in two states aiming to raise taxes on the oil industry the company said that the commitment had only applied to contributions to individual candidates during the  us election cycle bp employees contributed to various candidates with barack obama receiving the largest amount of money broadly in line with contributions from shell and chevron but significantly less than those of exxon mobil in  bp spent nearly  million lobbying the us congress in  bp spent a total of  on lobbying and had  registered lobbyists market manipulation investigations and sanctionsedit the us justice department and the commodity futures trading commission filed charges against bp products north america inc subsidiary of bp plc and several bp traders alleging they conspired to raise the price of propane by seeking to corner the propane market in  in  one former trader pleaded guilty in  bp paid  million in restitution and fines as part of an agreement to defer prosecution bp was charged with cornering and manipulating the price of tet propane in  and  bp paid a  million civil monetary penalty to the cftc established a compliance and ethics program and installed a monitor to oversee bp’s trading activities in the commodities markets bp also paid  million into a restitution fund for victims a  million criminal penalty plus  million into a consumer fraud fund as well as other payments also in  four other former traders were charged these charges were dismissed by a us district court in  on the grounds that the transactions were exempt under the commodities exchange act because they didnt occur in a marketplace but were negotiated contracts among sophisticated companies the dismissal was upheld by the court of appeals for the th circuit in  in november  us regulators ferc and cftc began an investigation of bp for allegedly manipulating the gas market the investigation relates to trading activity that occurred in october and november  at that time cftc enforcement staff provided bp with a notice of intent to recommend charges of attempted market manipulation in violation of the commodity exchange act bp denied that it engaged in any inappropriate or unlawful activity in july  the ferc staff issued a notice of alleged violations saying it had preliminarily determined that several bp entities fraudulently traded physical natural gas in the houston ship channel and katy markets and trading points to increase the value of their financial swing spread positions in may  the european commission started an investigation into allegations the companies reported distorted prices to the price reporting agency platts in order to manipulate the published prices for several oil and biofuel products the investigation was dropped in december  due to lack of
