minimum commitment from a leading broadband operator and cellular network operator for the deployment of  million units over  years the market opportunity the market opportunity for the barztm technology represents nearly  billion cell phone subscribers worldwide and is growing as a result of the following factors � dead zones weak signals and dropped calls are the biggest problems in the industry now by adding internet and video the quality issue is increasing exponentially �  of cellular subscribers use their mobile phone as the primary phone � more consumers are using mobile phones for web browsing up and down loading photos videos and music � more mobile phones are operating at higher frequencies which have less ability to penetrate buildings � weak signals make internet applications inaccessible and slow and increase the drain on cell phone batteries � forty percent of all mobile phone users report inadequate service in their homes or office and we estimate that  of the  billion mobile phone users worldwide consider continuous connectivity to be very important consumer demand for quality in the cell phone user experience is becoming an increasingly important factor the barztm technology meets this need barz is currently developing relationships with cellular network operators internationally to integrate the barztm product into cellular networks globally the recently developed expansion of product by introduction of the barz wifi router has facilitated the companys participation into a rapidly growing opportunity for broadband connectivity in the home in india currently  of homes in the region have broadband connectivity that percentage is expected to expand considerably in the region for a few reasons first the cost of connectivity is decreasing and in addition new apps exist which facilitate voice recognition and translation of commands any person in any language can now access the worldwide web the opportunity envisions the expansion of services beyond router connectivity the barz roadmap envisions expansion of product into the internet of things technologies and big data management services and sales why poor signals exist a variety of factors may cause dropped calls and dead zones including congestion radio signal interference tower handoff and lack of coverage despite continued infrastructure investment by operators and antenna technology improvements by base station providers and mobile phone makers these problems will continue for the foreseeable future this is because many of the contributing factors cant be controlled by the operators and manufacturers to understand how innovative barzr products are in improving phone signals its first important to understand the causes of poor signal quality congestion in  sales of mobile phones surpassed combined sales of personal computers and automobiles by  mobile phones had replaced landline phones in  of us households smart phones led by iphones and android phones have become indispensible personal assistants laptop computer sales outnumber desktop computer sales and most laptops are equipped with cellular data chipsets or usb modems apples ipad has sparked the connected tablet market too vending machines automobiles mobile sensors and many other devices include machine to machine cellular data modules as a result the number of cellular voice and data devices will soon exceed the number of people on earth if sheer numbers werent enough new uses for mobile devices are causing even faster growth in bandwidth usage obvious uses include video entertainment videoconferencing downloaded and streaming music mms email and application downloads facebook twitter foursquare and many other social networking applications put further load on operator networks also surprising sources of traffic have emerged such as deliberate miscalls a miscall is when one subscriber calls another but hangs up before the receiving party answers since operators dont charge for these uncompleted calls subscribers are using miscalls as a free way to communicate in india orders for milk are made this way in syria five miscalls in a row signals the recipient to go online to the internet and chat in bangladesh its estimated that up to  of traffic at peak times is due to miscalls this practice isnt limited to countries with low percapita income and yet it places a high load on operator networks there are sources of congestion based on location and time too transportation clusters like airports major highway intersections bridges and toll road gates all bring many people together at peak times also because of home landline replacement many residential neighborhoods have many mobile phones in simultaneous use in mornings and evenings lastly local population growth and immigration can result in too many phones for existing infrastructure due to long planning times investment requirements local government permits and construction time its difficult for infrastructure to keep up with the pace of change in many developing areas especially in growth countries radio signal interference interference comes from both obvious and subtle causes certain materials arent transparent to radio signals especially durable materials used in buildings large structures and even automobiles as a result there are radio shadows in which a mobile phone cant sense the signal from a base station in addition    oct   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage apple’s stock could double on the

areas   market opportunity readily available cellular industry data clearly shows that more than  of the world’s  billion mobile subscribers leave one network for a competing network specifically because of poor single quality dropped calls and terribly weak data throughput in industry parlance “churn” all at a time when cellular devices are becoming increasingly data reliant for barz to simply address the “churn” issue the market opportunity is at minimum approximately  billion however the company sees market potential well above the churn why in the highly competitive cellular market customer loyalty is driven by carriers that go that extra step in proving that they clearly understand how and for what purposes mobile subscribers currently use their mobile devices the data is clear on this voice revenues for carriers globally are rapidly falling while data revenues continue to climb despite the subpar data capabilities that mobile subscribers endure on a daily basis carrier networks simply are not yet adequately developed to capture the rapidly increasing demand for much increased data usage on mobile phones those infamous “drop spots” whether in the interior of a building or on the highway are not areas that are being ignored by network carriers rather the network carriers simply lack the final critical piece of their network infrastructure given this conundrum barz aims to change the way the carriers build rollout and deploy their network infrastructure with the barz network extender the barz network extender is the last piece of equipment that carriers need to be able to deliver optimum performance over their networks and finally put to rest years of subscriber frustration the barz network extender truly delivers the “last mile in mobile connectivity”   growth strategy barz has made great strides in advancing to its growth strategy backed by the help and expertise of a dedicated team of employees advisors and support from its

development roadmap envisions the core technology to be adapted to several different market segments in the near future including continuing to reduce the size of its devices furthermore barz is in the process of redesigning its mobile solution sand believes the new designs will be more suitable for incorporation by original equipment manufacturers oem the integration of this technology into products such as automobiles recreational vehicles and computers would represent a major leap forward in cellular network performance and improve customer satisfaction and usage   leadership most
