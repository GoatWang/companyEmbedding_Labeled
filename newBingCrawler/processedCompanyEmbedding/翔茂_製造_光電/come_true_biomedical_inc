contingent upon favorable stock price appreciation details of this financing were contained in a previous press release and k filing the resulting capital infusion allowed us to ramp up our pain management products preproduction builds and search for suitable production sources we have dissolved the pain management products joint venture and have integrated the hemp oil products pain management business into pbi our issued patent on our medication whose primary ingredients are most widely used to treat chemical and alcohol addiction fit well in our pain product division focus this is a real synergy between our patented drug and our hempbased formulations and enables us to focus more attention on the entire pain management business these pain products will be installed into a pain management division while our anticancer developments will be in a separate biologics division we consider our stock to be artificially low and a good investment for the futureimmunotherapy and biologicscontinuing discussions with several potential suitors to evaluate how we might jointly proceed to develop our proprietary technology to a point where it will be market readypain managementmany of our stockholders and followers have asked about the status of our distributor agreement with the nations largest online pharmacy we had indicated earlier that we expected the agreement to be signed several months ago but that has not happened due to a number of issues including two complete changes in top management at that company to issues related to perceived sales and marketing restrictions we have continued working with them and have not let frustration with corporate decision making stop us we still remain hopeful and cautiously optimistic but cannot guarantee the results if we are unable to conclude this distributorship deal we will seek arrangements with other large scale distributors in the last days of april we experienced a spike in orders for our products which was both good news and bad volume production was not yet ready and preproduction hand assembly processes were unable to keep up with the demand as a result customers experienced outofstock conditions and excessive delays in receiving products we did what we could to mitigate the inventory shortages and arranged for a spot buy of another product to provide us with synthetic enhanced products to provide both immediate and long term pain relief for our customers these products have been met with mixed reviews  some customers love them and have reordered them others do not on that basis we will continue those products in demand and discontinue those with limited sales potential in our efforts to launch production on our original patch and rollon we have become more acutely aware of market trends market needs and market gaps as a result we have delayed our exploration into a range of different hemp oilbased products like edibles and sprays in favor of expansion of patch products we believe the pain patch market is an underserved segment of the pain management market and holds great potential for growth we will be developing additional sizes and shapes of our hypoallergenic foam patch these will range from small bandagesized oneday patches ideal for short term local pain to large area patches for wide spread longer term pain we will also continue to offer both a sagescented oil based rollon and a lavender water based formulation rollon we are also increasing the levels of active pain reducing ingredient in our patches and rollons these new patches which have recently become available contain  mg of hemp oil extracts which is the most in the industry to our knowledge our oil based rollon will increase its hemp oil extract content by more than  to mg also the most in the industry to our knowledge to date we have made all of our topical pain patches and rollon applicators via hand operations we simply could not expand our distributorships nor plan for the future until we had resolved our formulations and had developed a reliable volume manufacturer now that we have resolved the difficult volume manufacturing problem we will aggressively expand our distribution network we intend to utilize the very successful relationships we have developed with rx xpress a pharmacy and dr vintons pain clinic both in grove city pa as a template to expand to other cities throughout the us canada mexico and the rest of the world we intend to work with amazon to further expand the sales through our web site at painreliefmedscom as well as from our direct distributors a potential european distributor has contacted us to investigate the possibility of a dropship agreement we are still working with them to resolve all issues we intend to attempt to develop other offshore distributors as our business expands we have been working with the chronic illness bloggers a worldwide group to request them to evaluate the effectiveness of our products to relieve pain we have had a number of very positive evaluations to date and have included these evaluations in the many voluntary testimonies we have received to date since we went into this business february   we expect more positive evaluations of our current products from this group and will utilize their excellent services to evaluate each new product we develop many of the voluntary testimonies that we have received to date indicate that the users of our products were able to achieve true pain relief and stop the use of dangerous opioid painkillers since we have seen estimates that opioidrelated deaths now exceed the death rate from automobile accidents we believe that the time is right to petition the national and state agencies to evaluate our allnatural pesticideandsolventfree products as a recommended alternative to opioidbased dangerous prescription pain pills which often lead to heroin addiction and death we are working with the veterans administration va to secure their endorsement to use our topical pain relief products in lieu of opioid pain products in their hospitals we have prepared a presentation and are starting our process with va personnel our plan is to take our proposal to the national level as soon as possible via our established contactsinvestorpublic relations programsin an effort to broaden our product exposure and boost our pain product sales we have an investor relations firm promoting our company and products on social media we are expanding our social media marketing campaigns including facebook focusing on the  age demographic which past experience has indicated is our prime market i plan to continue promoting premier biomedical and providing updates on our progress through press releases and monthly radio broadcasts which have been very effective in the past this is in addition to the occasional stu taylor radio show interviewssummarythis first half we cleared our books of convertible debt launched a revenuegenerating product line and secured more conventional financing with incentives for the lender to appreciate rather than depreciate our stock price we established a number of direct distributors including pharmacies and health clinics now that we have resolved the product formulations and volume manufacturing to our specifications we are attempting to expand our distributor networks both within north america as well as offshore we are in the process of developing and launching several additional pain relieving products which we intend to spotmarket testwe have been very busy building our business and now that we have resolved the basic issue of developing an industrybest formulation and a volume manufacturing system we are poised to expand our business geometrically
