product code se the everincreasing demands for miniaturization and higher functionality at less cost processes have driven the development of stacked ics and system in package sip technologies system in package sip is a single reduced functional module realized by the horizontal tiling or vertical stacking of two or more similar or dissimilar bare die or packaged chips taking the chips nearer enables the highest level of silicon integration and area efficiency at the lowest cost compared to mounting them separately in traditional ways in doing so the electrical pathway length between chips is reduced leading to a higher performance system on package sop is an emerging trend in the system miniaturization technology in divergence to systemonchip soc at ic level and system in package sip at module level system in package sip is obtained by thinning ics from its original  micron thick wafer dimensions to  microns and stacking as many as  of these one on top of the other in d form these are then interconnected by either wire bond or flipchip technology the current through silicon via tsv developments have further condensed system in package sip by replacing flip chip with pad to pad bonding the capability to integrate different technologies and to reduce total production cost and time to market are the prime drivers for system in package sip packaging system in package sip has enabled the rapid integration of active and passive devices into single package solutions this approach has also reduced product costs allowing systems to be partitioned into the most costeffective blocks the stacked system in package sip alignments reduce the system size and eliminate the cost of individual packages for each die they also improve signal transmission times and reduced power by minimizing capacitive loads between ics the rapid expansion of the system in package sip market has inspired research and development in system in package sip associated technology by integrated device manufacturers idm as well as electronic manufacturing services ems providers and semiconductor assembly services sas with this evolution of system in package sip technology during the last few decades the future trend for system in package sip technology in the next decade or two will be clearer if we look at the future electronics market sectors such as mobile products highend computers automobiles flatpanel highdefinition tvs hdtvs and sensors for security health care and environment the consumer mobile products will advance to more multi functionality thus realizing the digital
