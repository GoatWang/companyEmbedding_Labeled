is a white longhaired goat like animal with curled horns that lives in the mountains thus the name mram did you buy that of course not ok so heres what an mram really is an mram is a magnetoresistive random access memory which is a method of storing data bits using magnetic charges instead of the electrical charges used by dram dynamic random access memory scientists define a metal ⋯⋯as magnetoresistive if it shows a slight change in electrical resistance when placed in a magnetic field by combining the high speed of static ram and the high density of dram mram could be used to significantly improve electronic products by storing greater amounts of data enabling it to be accessed faster while consuming less battery power than existing electronic memory our next generation products are called stmrams or sttmrams the st stands for spin torque or spin transfer torque this stuff is very a complicated and complex technology that would take me a week of writing to explain really you really want me to explainok well you asked for it spin transfer torque is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a magnetic tunnel junction or spin valve can be modified
