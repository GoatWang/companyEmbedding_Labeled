deutsch español français italiano polski edit classic editor history comments k share ia vocaloid ia rocks cevio ia english ia biographical information gender female voice lia illustrator aka akasaka panamá product information company st place co ltd language japanese code stv affiliation yamaha corporation ia イア is a japanese vocaloid developed and distributed by st place co ltd and was released in january  for the vocaloid engine her voice is provided by the japanese female singersongwriter lia known for tori no uta in july  an english voicebank was confirmed to be in the works conceptedit ia is the first vocal in the  aria on the planetes  project the design philosophy st place worked toward was to make the voice simple and straightforward but easy to adjust and customize letting creators create their own version of ia etymologyedit ia is taken from her voice providers name lia there are at least two ways to read her projects name of  aria on the planetes  the words aria and planetes are latin and greek for open space and planet respectively giving the translation of open space on the planet aria is also the italian word for air and is used as a term in opera for expressive pieces usually sung by a single singer this also fits in with her more operaesque vocal results compared to other released japanese vocaloids when she was first released overseas fans often mistook aria as the name of the vocaloid appearanceedit her design was illustrated by aka akasaka d z while the design direction was by maxilla inc it was decided that they would go for soft colours instead of vivid ones at the time there was skepticism towards avoiding vivid colours as there was a fear of her not selling because of the softer tones lia herself wanted her to be cute and pretty and was satisfied the first time she was shown the artwork despite the myth of ias age being  she has had no age assigned to her this myth seems to originate from a section underneath the paragraph on ia about her provider lia wherein one of the first things mentioned was that lia debuted in america at  years old relationsedit one is a vocal created for cevio able to talk as well as sing she is the second vocal in the  aria on the planetes  project music featuring iaedit ia is featured in  songs and  albums on this wiki there are listings for notable original and cover songs examples of usage

bilibili vocaloid ia on soundcloud additional informationedit marketingedit the garage kit ia information on ia was released much slower than the average vocaloid her promotions have taken the approach to make her seem otherworldly and mysterious the licensing for ia is slightly different than past vocaloids and it is worth taking the time to read this page for more details unlike some past vocaloids users can use her image on cds flyers and posters without requesting permission although some consent from the company is needed for greater use of her image this is a departure from past vocaloids such as crypton future media who require you to ask permission for use of their vocaloids images on things such as cds flyers and posters st place likes collaborations between their company and others their marketing style was designed to introduce ia to people unfamiliar with vocaloid expanding their audience see also iamarketing and vocaloid in other media reputationedit ias character status reaction ia developed a good reputation as a reliable voicebank library among many producers this owed to much of her success ia was well received and had many hits in the nico nico douga weekly rankings after her release within  months of her release several songs hit  views on nico nico douga whereas none of the other vocaloid vocals achieved success of this caliber until december  when yuzuki yukari managed to achieve her first  song this put her on par with some of the more successful vocaloid era voicebanks lia herself was reported as surprised when she became popular as she did not expect her to do so well she also commented on how there were many fans of ia who did not even know who she lia was on st july  it was announced that her playback of related videos had reached  million views were coming in from both japan and abroad she had also experienced several live performances in taiwan france and north america this lead to the release of her official app impact ias popularity has lead to further vocal development being considered for her and in  iaaria on the planetes  α type c was released as a trial version via a onemonth long feedback campaign several months

this opportunity to introduce you to our company impro had its beginning with the discovery of the theory of limited isolation housing and how it could translate to healthier thriftier calves this discovery led to the  published research by james s collins titled “the principle of isolation – it’s application in animal husbandry” subsequently impro products designed constructed and copyrighted the first “calfloo” in  to this day many universities and companies have taken these original findings and have altered the original design to fit their own specific needs although impro products never chose to capitalize commercially on the invention of the “calfloo” the philosophy of observing and working with nature to strive for peak production performance has resulted in the development of a number of products and programs that we recommend for achieving this end we believe that only a healthy animal can produce at its genetic capacity and that the key to production is proper care and nutrition throughout an animal’s life please feel free to browse our available product line and if you would like more information on how to implement the use of these products into your daily
