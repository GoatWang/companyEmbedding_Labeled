the top end of managements guidance targets and aois share price rose as much as  the next day at this point aoi investors have enjoyed marketstomping returns of  in  and  over the last  weeks these massive gains are based on unrelenting demand for aois datacenter products to the point where the company must continue to improve its manufacturing operations in order to exploit the huge customer interest lets take a closer look at the datacenter components behind applied optoelectronics success in  image source getty images welcome to the data center while waiting for the full secondquarter report let me point out that data center sales accounted for  of aois sales in the first quarter up from  in the yearago period in particular leading customers amazoncom nasdaqamzn and microsoft nasdaqmsft added up to  of the companys total sales in  as their rapidly growing cloudcomputing services require epic numbers of highspeed datacenter networks copperbased ethernet cables are going out of style for these applications because the data streams moving around modern data centers can overwhelm gigabit cables and faster ethernet solutions are limited by data loss over long cable runs the topshelf cat  cables required for gigabit ethernet connections are only rated for up to  meters of cable length thats where aoi and its sector rivals step in with fiberoptic transceiver modules rated for speeds up to  gigabits per second  with no practical limit on cable lengths in the confines of a data center aois gigabit g and g modules for datacenter applications are listed at maximum cable runs as long as  kilometers a gigabit qsfp lr datacenter module image source applied optoelectronics optical transceiver modules about twothirds of aois datacenter sales are for g optical transceivers the remainder comes from g transceivers the mix is changing as customers look into nextgeneration g networks and aoi is already developing g and g transceivers for future use the basic design of these faster solutions is not changing the popular qsfp package seen above combines a small physical footprint with low power consumption allowing device builders and datacenter operators to cram a lot of bandwidth into small spaces instead the core research is going into developing faster laser diodes inside g modules theres a bundle of four gigabit diodes the diode speed steps up to g in a g module

inc stock rose  in july preliminary earnings looked great and analysts are falling over themselves to compliment this fiberoptic components supplier except for that guy in the corner heres why hes wrong anders bylund tmfzahrim aug   at am what happened shares of applied optoelectronics nasdaqaaoi gained  in july  according to data from sp global market intelligence yes the stock gained  in a single month thats not a typo so what the maker of highspeed transceivers and other components for fiberoptic networking equipment was already on a massive roll at the start of july having soared nearly  higher in the first six months of  and then the train kept rolling aoi released preliminary secondquarter results on july  exceeding managements own guidance targets by wide margins an avalanche of analyst upgrades and target price boosts followed and aois share prices jolted upward with every rosy research note image source getty images now what analyst firm bws financial broke from the jubilant crowd to issue a sell rating on aoi with a hugely negative target price of  per share on july  its theory is that largest customer amazoncom nasdaqamzn has been ordering highspeed optical transceivers from aoi rival fabrinet nysefn recently arguably pointing to lost sales for this highflier the markets simply shrugged off that complaint and aois rise continued amazon could simply be ordering more transceivers on top of the large supply aoi can provide consider this quote by applied optoelectronics cfo stefan murry from the firstquarter earnings call in may right now were basically shipping everything we can manufacture so the growth rate is not dependent on demand its dependent on our ability to continue to ramp our manufacturing murry added theres a limit to how fast we can increase our production capacity so thats really the limiting factor to the growth rate so amazon might be wise to expand its component sourcing to another supplier  and thats not necessarily bad news for aoi at all anders bylund owns shares of amazon the motley fool owns shares of and recommends amazon the motley fool has a disclosure policy author anders bylund tmfzahrim
