echocardiography  ecg criteria  treatment  associated genes  see also  references causesedit while ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure it is one aspect of ventricular remodeling while lvh itself is not a disease it is usually a marker for disease involving the heart disease processes that can cause lvh include any disease that increases the afterload that the heart has to contract against and some primary diseases of the muscle of the heart causes of increased afterload that can cause lvh include aortic stenosis aortic insufficiency and hypertension primary disease of the muscle of the heart that cause lvh are known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathies which can lead into heart failure longstanding mitral insufficiency also leads to lvh as a compensatory mechanism diagnosisedit the principal method to diagnose lvh is echocardiography with which the thickness of the muscle of the heart can be measured the electrocardiogram ecg often shows signs of increased voltage from the heart in individuals with lvh so this is often used as a screening test to determine who should undergo further testing echocardiographyedit two dimensional echocardiography can produce images of the left ventricle the thickness of the left ventricle as visualized on echocardiography correlates with its actual mass normal thickness of the left ventricular myocardium is from  to  cm as measured at the very end of diastole if the myocardium is more than  cm thick the diagnosis of lvh can be made ecg criteriaedit left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities as seen on ecg there are several sets of criteria used to diagnose lvh via electrocardiography none of them is perfect though by using multiple criteria sets the sensitivity and specificity are increased the sokolowlyon index s in v or v  r in v or v whichever is larger ≥  mm ≥  large squares r in avl ≥  mm the cornell voltage criteria for the ecg diagnosis of lvh involve measurement of the sum of the r wave in lead avl and the s wave in

the use in wire edm machines that unlike other rust inhibitors works independently of the electric conductance of the dielectric fluid   direction savan rvh should be used as a  solution thus  l of savan rvh have to be mixed with  l of water the solution should be added to the machine in small portions while it is running the concentration must be monitored and complied with this can easily be done with a hand held refractometer available from edm sales  supplies inc it is important that no acideous fluids get mixed in with the solution if your water turns black after a few days you should change your dielectric this effect is due to the excellent cleaning characteristics of savan rvh it will only happen once and will also help to eliminate troublesome residue which collects in the machine   further characteristics savan rvh does not contain any toxic or harmful ingredients it is  biodegradable does not have any dermatological effects and can be easily disposed there are no reactions with ionexchange resin due to its independence of the dielectric fluid’s electric conductance work pieces can stay in the water for a long time without any threats of corrosion   storage and handling the product should be stored between ºc and ºc in order to prevent biological deterioration the dielectric‘s temperature should be kept below °c categoriesedm graphite poco edm graphite
