it has further expanded its zetex zxld led driver series with the introduction of three new miniature led drivers offering improved accuracy and thermal performance provided in tsot and thermallyenhanced dfn packages the highly integrated zxld zxld and zxld deliver adjustable output currents of ma ma and a respectively and are designed for a broad range of automotive architectural and industrial lighting applications with a typical output current accuracy better than one percent zxld and zxld led drivers provide highly accurate current matching at working voltages up to v capable of producing output powers of w and w respectively these tsot and  mm x  mm dfn packaged led drivers will support up to  leds in an array of applications that require minimum footprint and maximum efficiency operating from a v to v supply and capable of producing an output current up to ma the  mm x  mm tsot packaged zxld led driver can provide up to w of power for driving chains up to  leds with a large pwm dimming ratio of  the zxld offers highly flexible brightness control and accurate color mixing the zxld series of continuous mode inductive stepdown led drivers are characterized by their simplicity of configuration and only require three simple external discrete components nominal output current set by a resistor is easily adjusted by applying a pwm or dc voltage control signal to precisely match users brightness requirements and a lowlevel control signal turns the output off to put the led driver into standby about diodes incorporated diodes incorporated nasdaq diod
