jenoptik ag   press release  distributed by public on   jenoptik expands laser rangefinder product family jenoptik presents a new product in the form of the dlem  at the american ausa exposition in hall a at booth  the lightweight weighs less than  grams and measures distances up to  km with an accuracy of half a meter dlem  is the latest smallest and lightest product of the previously fourstrong dlem family with its broad range of military applications the eyesafe dlem  class  laser is barely higher than a oneeuro coin it is distinguished in operation by low energy consumption and has very high accuracy even at extreme temperatures of  to  degrees  even with highly reflective targets the low beam divergence produces a very small measuring point which greatly improves the accuracy for small targets at large distances added to this is a high selectivity when detecting several overlapping targets the dlem  measures fixed targets and moving targets at up to  hz with its compact robust design and good measuring characteristics the dlem  is the smallest and lightest unit in its class these product characteristics enable it to be easily fitted in handheld surveillance and firing control systems as well as unmanned aerial vehicles uav pictures are available for download in the jenoptik image database in the current events gallery as an integrated photonics company jenoptik is active in the five divisions of optical systems healthcare  industry automotive traffic solutions and defense  civil systems the defense  civil systems division develops produces and
