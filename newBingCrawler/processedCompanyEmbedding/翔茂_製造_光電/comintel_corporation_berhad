sangeetha amarthalingam  the edge financial daily june    am myt this article first appeared in the edge financial daily on june   a a kulim after numerous extensions due to technical problems comintel corp bhd’s mw gasification renewable energy plant in kuang selangor would be commissioned this august seen as a new revenue stream for the group the green technology business — undertaken by its whollyowned subsidiary comintel green technologies sdn bhd — could emerge as the main revenue stream in about two years as the market for this product is huge said executive director loh hock chiang the group’s defence maintenance business meanwhile is set to be phased out as it has been reporting losses for the past five years after the government cut up to  of its annual defence budget due to the economic slowdown “our kuang revenue will be based on the current approved feedin tariff of  sen per kilowatthour based on  availability the annual gross revenue will be about rm million “this portion of revenue will only commence at the earliest in august pending the commercial operation date from the sustainable energy development authority of malaysia seda our contract is a year renewable energy power purchase agreement with tnb tenaga nasional bhd” loh told the edge financial daily growth of the green technology segment is exponential as the technology is scalable and easily installed at any site in the world particularly in developing countries apart from being environmentally friendly it uses readily available raw materials such as palm oil waste or biomass loh said there are vast opportunities in the sector based on the amount of palm oil waste available in the country meaning that there are thousands of megawatts of energy waiting to be tapped “capital expenditure depends largely on the type of feedstock used to generate energy from waste going forward we would like to focus on solving the challenges faced with municipal solid waste msw “our system powered by thermal decomposition is suitable because it is modular decentralised and need not be large it costs about us million rm million to us million per megawatt to install which is dependent on the waste composition and moisture content” he said comintel recently completed the first half of the initial operation date iod test which constitutes the main test before tnb verifies the system’s compliance prior to this seda approved the extension of the feedin tariff commencement date fitcd to july  “we should complete the iod by june and once the fitcd is in place the plant can start operation” loh said the plant is able to power up to  urban residential units and  rural residential homes whereas in commercial areas it could support  units comintel which has traditionally been involved in electronic manufacturing services ems and systems integration including defence maintenance has been experimenting in the green technology field for five years the diversification into the green technology segment which falls under the systems integration umbrella is expected to see the company take on calls by indonesian and filipino governments that are keen on the plant he said comintel is able to design systems to use  tonnes of msw a day or up to  tonnes a day for cities “there are ongoing discussions with these governments that might want to set up similar plants these countries do not want incineration as a solution to handle their msw challenges when there are better approaches “once the plant in kuang takes off we might get substantial orders and be able to roll out similar plants in the region beginning in the financial year ending jan   fy” he said adding that the speed of expansion depends on financials “we might look at investors in the long run because a majority of the projects will be on an ownandoperate basis involving substantial capital outlay in return this would provide a sustainable longterm revenue stream” he added comintel’s net profit for fy jumped  to rm million from rm million in fy as revenue grew  to rm million from rm million the improved performance was due mainly to higher shipments of products in its manufacturing segment efficiency improvement in the group’s frontend manufacturing processes strengthening of the us dollar and lower losses from its systems integration segment meanwhile loh said the ems segment which contributed more than  of revenue will continue business as usual as the group looks for a marketing partner for its light emitting diode home and street lighting products in malaysia and overseas “there are negotiations going on with a local player and a foreign corporation to partner with us to market the lights here and overseas respectively” he said comintel’s share price closed down two
