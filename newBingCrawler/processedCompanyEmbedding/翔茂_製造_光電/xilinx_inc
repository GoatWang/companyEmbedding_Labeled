corporate strategy and culture  origin of the company name  ross freeman  competition  references  external links historyedit early daysedit ross freeman bernard vonderschmitt and james v barnett ii who all had worked for integrated circuit and solidstate device manufacturer zilog corp founded xilinx in  while working for zilog freeman wanted to create chips that acted like a blank tape allowing users to program the technology themselves at the time the concept was paradigm changing the concept required lots of transistors and at that time transistors were considered extremely precious—people thought that rosss idea was pretty far out said xilinx fellow bill carter who when hired in  as the first ic designer was xilinxs eighth employee big semiconductor manufacturers were enjoying strong profits by producing massive volumes of generic circuits designing and manufacturing dozens of different circuits for specific markets offered lower profit margins and required greater manufacturing complexity what became known as the fpga would allow circuits produced in quantity to be tailored by individual market segments freeman failed to convince zilog to invest in creating the fpga to chase what was only a  million market at the time freeman and barnett left zilog and teamed up with their yearold excolleague bernard vonderschmitt to raise  million in venture funding to design the first commercially viable fpga they incorporated the company in  and began selling its first product by  by late  the company had raised more than  million in venture capital equivalent to  million in  and generated revenues at an annualized rate of nearly  million growthedit as demand for programmable logic continued to grow so did xilinxs revenues and profits from  to  the companys revenue grew each year from  million to  million to  million during this time period the company which had been providing funding to xilinx monolithic memories inc mmi was purchased by xilinx competitor amd as a result xilinx dissolved the deal with mmi and went public on the nasdaq in  the company also moved to a squarefoot  m plant in san jose california in order to keep pace with demand from companies like hp apple inc ibm and sun microsystems who were buying large quantities from xilinx xilinx competitors emerged in the fpga market in the mids despite the competition xilinxs sales grew to  million in   million in  and  million in  the company reached  million in revenue in  one decade after having sold its first product according to market research firm isuppli xilinx has held the lead in programmable logic device market share since the late s over the years xilinx expanded operations to india asia and europe xilinxs sales rose from  million in  to  billion by the end of its fiscal year  moshe gavrielov – an eda and asic industry veteran who was appointed as president and ceo in early  – introduced targeted design platforms that combine fpgas with software ip cores boards and kits to address focused target applications these targeted design platforms are an alternative to costly applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and applicationspecific standard products assps todayedit the company has expanded its product portfolio since its founding xilinx sells a broad range of fpgas complex programmable logic devices cplds design tools intellectual property and reference designs xilinx also has a global services and training program after using the introduction of d chips to deliver more powerful fpgas xilinx then adapted the technology to combine formerly separate components in a single chip first combining an fpga with transceivers to boost bandwidth capacity while using less power according to xilinx ceo moshe gavrielov the addition of a heterogeneous communications device combined with the introduction of new software tools and the zynq line of  nm soc devices that combine an arm core with an fpga are part of shifting its position from a programmable logic device supplier to one delivering “all things programmable” the companys products have been recognized by ee times edn and others for innovation and market impact in addition to zynq xilinx product lines see current family lines include the virtex kintex and artix series each including configurations and models optimized for different applications with the introduction of the xilinx  series in june  the company has moved to three major fpga product families the highend virtex the midrange kintex family and the lowcost artix family retiring the spartan brand which ends with the xilinx series  fpgas in april  the company introduced the vivado design suite  a nextgeneration socstrength design environment for advanced electronic system designs in may  the company shipped the first of the next generation fpgas the  nm ultrascale technologyedit the spartan platform was the industry’s first nm fpga delivering more functionality and bandwidth per dollar than was previously possible setting new standards in the programmable logic industry xilinx designs develops and markets programmable logic products including integrated circuits ics software design tools predefined system functions delivered as intellectual property ip cores design services customer training field engineering and technical support xilinx sells both fpgas and cplds for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as communications industrial consumer automotive and data processing xilinxs fpgas have been used for the alice a large ion collider experiment at the cern european laboratory on the frenchswiss border to map and disentangle the trajectories of thousands of subatomic particles xilinx has also engaged in a partnership with the united states air force research laboratory’s space vehicles directorate to develop fpgas to withstand the damaging effects of radiation in space which are  times less sensitive to space radiation than the commercial equivalent for deployment in new satellites the virtexii pro virtex virtex and virtex fpga families which include up to two embedded ibm powerpc cores are targeted to the needs of systemonchip soc

version webpack edition of vivado provides designers with a limited version of the design environment xilinxs embedded developers kit edk supports the embedded powerpc  and  cores in virtexii pro and some virtex and  chips and the microblaze core xilinxs system generator for dsp implements dsp designs on xilinx fpgas a freeware version of its eda software called ise webpack is used with some of its nonhighperformance chips xilinx is the only as of  fpga vendor to distribute a native linux freeware synthesis toolchain xilinx announced the architecture for a new arm cortexabased platform for embedded systems designers that combines the software programmability of an embedded processor with the hardware flexibility of an fpga the new architecture abstracts much of the hardware burden away from the embedded software developers point of view giving them an unprecedented level of control in the development process with this platform software developers can leverage their existing system code based on arm technology and utilize vast offtheshelf opensource and commercially available software component libraries because the system boots an os at reset software development can get under way quickly within familiar development and debug environments using tools such as arms realview development suite and related thirdparty tools eclipsebased ides gnu the xilinx software development kit and others in early  xilinx began shipping a new device family based on this architecture the zynq soc platform immerses arm multicores programmable logic fabric dsp data paths memories and io functions in a dense and configurable mesh of interconnect the platform targets embedded designers working on market applications that require multifunctionality and realtime responsiveness such as automotive driver assistance intelligent video surveillance industrial automation aerospace and defense and nextgeneration wireless following the introduction of its  nm series fpgas xilinx revealed that several of the highestdensity parts in those fpga product lines will be constructed using multiple dies in one package employing technology developed for d construction and stackeddie assemblies the company’s stacked silicon interconnect ssi technology stacks several three or four active fpga dies sidebyside on a silicon interposer – a single piece of silicon that carries passive interconnect the individual fpga dies are conventional and are flipchip mounted by microbumps on to the interposer the interposer provides direct interconnect between the fpga dies with no need for transceiver technologies such as highspeed serdes in october  xilinx shipped the first fpga to use the new technology the virtex t fpga which includes  billion transistors and  million asic gates the following spring xilinx used the d technology to ship the virtex ht the industry’s first heterogeneous fpgas which combine high bandwidth fpgas with up to sixteen  gbits and seventytwo  gbits transceivers to reduce power and size requirements for key nxg and g line card applications and functions in january  xilinx acquired design tool firm autoesl design technologies and added system c highlevel design for its  and series fpga families the addition of autoesl tools extends the design community for fpgas to designers more accustomed to designing at a higher level of abstraction using c c and system c in april  xilinx introduced a redesign of its toolset for programmable systems called vivado design suite this ip and systemcentric design software supports newer high capacity devices and speeds the design of programmable logic and io vivado provides faster integration and implementation for programmable systems into devices with d stacked silicon interconnect technology arm processing systems analog mixed signal ams and many semiconductor intellectual property ip cores current family linesedit cpld xilinx xcxl prior to  xilinx offered two main fpga families the highperformance virtex series and the highvolume spartan series with a cheaper easypath option for ramping to volume production the company also provides two cpld lines the coolrunner and the  series each model series has been released in multiple generations since its launch with the introduction of its  nm fpgas in june  xilinx replaced the highvolume spartan family with the kintex family and the lowcost artix family in newer fpga products xilinx minimizes total power consumption by the adoption of a highk metal gate hkmg process which allows for low static power consumption at the  nm node static power is a significant portion of the total power dissipation of a device and in some cases is the dominant factor through the use of a hkmg process xilinx has reduced power use while increasing logic capacity virtex and spartan fpga families are said to consume  percent less power and have up to twice the logic capacity compared to the previous generation of xilinx fpgas in june  xilinx introduced the xilinx  series the virtex kintex and artix families promising improvements in system power performance capacity and price these new fpga families are manufactured using tsmcs  nm hkmg process the  nm series  devices feature a  percent power reduction compared to the companys  nm devices and offer capacity of up to  million logic cells less than one year after announcing the  series  nm fpgas xilinx shipped the world’s first  nm fpga device the kintex making this the programmable industry’s fastest product rollout in march  xilinx introduced the zynq family which integrates a complete arm cortexa mpcore processorbased system on a  nm fpga for system architects and embedded software developers in may  xilinx expanded the  series with the production of the spartan family in dec  xilinx introduced the ultrascale series virtex ultrascale and kintex ultrascale families these new fpga families are manufactured by tsmc in its  nm planar process at the same time it announced an ultrascale soc architecture called zynq ultrascale mpsoc in tsmc  nm finfet process virtex familyedit main article virtex fpga the virtex series of fpgas have integrated features that include fifo and ecc logic dsp blocks pciexpress controllers ethernet mac blocks and highspeed transceivers in addition to fpga logic the virtex series includes embedded fixed function hardware for commonly used functions such as multipliers memories serial transceivers and microprocessor cores these capabilities are used in applications such as wired and wireless infrastructure equipment advanced medical equipment test and measurement and defense systems xilinxs most recently announced virtex the virtex  family is based on a  nm design and is reported to deliver a twofold system performance improvement at  percent lower power compared to previous generation virtex devices in addition virtex doubles the memory bandwidth compared to previous generation virtex fpgas with  mbits memory interfacing performance and over two million logic cells in  xilinx began shipping sample quantities of the virtex t d fpga which combines four smaller fpgas into a single package by placing them on a special silicon interconnection pad called an interposer to deliver  billion transistors in a single large chip the interposer provides  data pathways between the individual fpgas – roughly  to  times more than would usually be available on a board – to create a single fpga in  using the same d technology xilinx introduced initial shipments of their virtex ht fpga a heterogeneous device so called because it comprises two fpga dies and one channel gbits transceiver die in the same package the virtex family is built on a  nm process for computeintensive electronic systems and the company claims it consumes  percent less power and has  percent improved performance over competing  nm fpgas the virtex lx and the lxt are intended for logicintensive applications and the virtex sxt is for dsp applications with the virtex xilinx changed the logic fabric from fourinput luts to sixinput luts with the increasing complexity of combinational logic functions required by soc designs the percentage of combinational paths requiring multiple fourinput luts had become a performance and routing bottleneck the new sixinput lut represented a tradeoff between better handling of increasingly complex combinational functions at the expense of a reduction in the absolute number of luts per device the virtex series is a  nm design fabricated in  v tripleoxide process technology legacy virtex devices virtex virtexii virtexii pro virtex  are still available but are not recommended for use in new designs kintexedit the kintex family is the first xilinx midrange fpga family that the company claims delivers virtex family performance at less than half the price while consuming  percent less power the kintex family includes highperformance  gbits or lowercost optimized  gbits serial connectivity memory and logic performance required for applications such as high volume g optical wired communication equipment and provides a balance of signal processing performance power consumption and cost to support the deployment of long term evolution lte wireless networks artixedit the artix family delivers  percent lower power and  percent lower cost compared to the spartan family and is based on the unified virtexseries architecture xilinx claims that artix fpgas deliver the performance required to address costsensitive highvolume markets previously served by assps asics and lowcost fpgas the artix family is designed to address the small form factor and lowpower performance requirements of batterypowered portable ultrasound equipment commercial digital camera lens control and military avionics and communications equipment with the introduction of the spartan family in  which lack highbandwidth transceivers the artixs position in the xilinx costoptimized portfolio was clarified as being the transceiver optimized member zynqedit the zynq family of socs addresses highend embeddedsystem applications such as video surveillance automotivedriver assistance nextgeneration wireless and factory automation zynq integrate a complete arm cortexa mpcoreprocessorbased  nm system the zynq architecture differs from previous marriages of programmable logic and embedded processors by moving from an fpgacentric platform to a processorcentric model for software developers zynq appear the same as a standard fully featured arm processorbased systemonchip soc booting immediately at powerup and capable of running a variety of operating systems independently of the programmable logic in  xilinx introduced the zynq which integrates digital signal processing dsp to meet emerging programmable systems integration requirements of wireless broadcast medical and military applications the new zynq product family posed a key challenge for system designers because xilinx ise design software had not been developed to handle the capacity and complexity of designing with an fpga with an arm core xilinxs new vivado design suite addressed this issue because the software was developed for higher capacity fpgas and it included high level synthesis hls functionality that allows engineers to compile the coprocessors from a cbased description the axiom the worlds first digital cinema camera that is open source hardware contains a zynq a zynq  or  is included in the adapteva parallella board in october  snickerdoodle combined zynq with wifi and bluetooth spartan familyedit xilinx s spartane fpga family the spartan series targets low cost highvolume applications with a lowpower footprint eg displays settop boxes wireless routers and other applications the spartan family is built on a nanometer nm metal layer dualoxide process technology the spartan was marketed in  as a lowcost option for automotive wireless communications flatpanel display and video surveillance applications the spartan family built on the same nm process used in the other series fpgas was announced in  and became available in  unlike the artix family and the lxt members of the spartan family the spartan fpgas lack highbandwidth transceivers easypathedit because easypath devices are identical to the fpgas that customers are already using the parts can be produced faster and more reliably from the time they are ordered compared to similar competing programs a week time is guaranteed from receiving the design to mass production and no redesign or requalification are required by the customer in addition customers are free to switch production from the nonprogrammable easypath fpga to the original programmable virtex fpga if the need for design changes arises baysand provides similar service to xilinx called metalcopy metalcopy is based on baysands metal configurable standard cells mcsc and baysands asic design methodology flow metalcopy consists of taking the design from rtl to asic including synthesis physical layout timing closure test insertion build in test formal verification and static timing analysis baysand currently offers metalcopy for all fpga designs including  nm and  nm fpga devices corporate strategy and cultureedit xilinx joined the fortune ranks of the  best companies to work for in  as no  rose to no  in  and rose again to no  in  in december  gsa named xilinx the most respected public semiconductor company with  million to  billion in annual sales the award recognizes excellence through success vision and strategy in the industry origin of the company nameedit having tried to register a number of more conventional companynames and having them rejected as already taken the founders decided to deliberately create an unusual name in order to ensure that the name was accepted several legends explain the origin of the name xilinx fellow bill carter said that the name xilinx was chosen because the chemical symbol for silicon is si the xs at each end represent programmable logic blocks the linx represents programmable links that connect the logic blocks together another explanation has it that two of the founders ross freeman and jim barnett both attended the university of illinois at urbana–champaign also called the fighting illini the name allegedly originated because the company founders were two exillini hence xilinx two x illini ross freemanedit ross freeman credited with the invention of the fpga was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in  more than  years after the invention of the fpga starting in  xilinx has had an annual tradition of awarding a company employee with the ross freeman award for technical innovation in freemans memory award honorees are based on nominations for innovations that resulted in significant tangible benefit to the company finalists are chosen by a committee and winners are selected based on a vote competitionedit today xilinx customers represent just over half of

today  technology  current family lines  virtex family  kintex  artix  zynq  spartan family  easypath  corporate strategy and culture  origin of the company name  ross freeman  competition  references  external links historyedit early daysedit ross freeman bernard vonderschmitt and james v barnett ii who all had worked for integrated circuit and solidstate device manufacturer zilog corp founded xilinx in  while working for zilog freeman wanted to create chips that acted like a blank tape allowing users to program the technology themselves at the time the concept was paradigm changing the concept required lots of transistors and at that time transistors were considered extremely precious—people thought that rosss idea was pretty far out said xilinx fellow bill carter who when hired in  as the first ic designer was xilinxs eighth employee big semiconductor manufacturers were enjoying strong profits by producing massive volumes of generic circuits designing and manufacturing dozens of different circuits for specific markets offered lower profit margins and required greater manufacturing complexity what became known as the fpga would allow circuits produced in quantity to be tailored by individual market segments freeman failed to convince zilog to invest in creating the fpga to chase what was only a  million market at the time freeman and barnett left zilog and teamed up with their yearold excolleague bernard vonderschmitt to raise  million in venture funding to design the first commercially viable fpga they incorporated the company in  and began selling its first product by  by late  the company had raised more than  million in venture capital equivalent to  million in  and generated revenues at an annualized rate of nearly  million growthedit as demand for programmable logic continued to grow so did xilinxs revenues and profits from  to  the companys revenue grew each year from  million to  million to  million during this time period the company which had been providing funding to xilinx monolithic memories inc mmi was purchased by xilinx competitor amd as a result xilinx dissolved the deal with mmi and went public on the nasdaq in  the company also moved to a squarefoot  m plant in san jose california in order to keep pace with demand from companies like hp apple inc ibm and sun microsystems who were buying large quantities from xilinx xilinx competitors emerged in the fpga market in the mids despite the competition xilinxs sales grew to  million in   million in  and  million in  the company reached  million in revenue in  one decade after having sold its first product according to market research firm isuppli xilinx has held the lead in programmable logic device market share since the late s over the years xilinx expanded operations to india asia and europe xilinxs sales rose from  million in  to  billion by the end of its fiscal year  moshe gavrielov – an eda and asic industry veteran who was appointed as president and ceo in early  – introduced targeted design platforms that combine fpgas with software ip cores boards and kits to address focused target applications these targeted design platforms are an alternative to costly applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and applicationspecific standard products assps todayedit the company has expanded its product portfolio since its founding xilinx sells a broad range of fpgas complex programmable logic devices cplds design tools intellectual property and reference designs xilinx also has a global services and training program after using the introduction of d chips to deliver more powerful fpgas xilinx then adapted the technology to combine formerly separate components in a single chip first combining an fpga with transceivers to boost bandwidth capacity while using less power according to xilinx ceo moshe gavrielov the addition of a heterogeneous communications device combined with the introduction of new software tools and the zynq line of  nm soc devices that combine an arm core with an fpga are part of shifting its position from a programmable logic device supplier to one delivering “all things programmable” the companys products have been recognized by ee times edn and others for innovation and market impact in addition to zynq xilinx product lines see current family lines include the virtex kintex and artix series each including configurations and models optimized for different applications with the introduction of the xilinx  series in june  the company has moved to three major fpga product families the highend virtex the midrange kintex family and the lowcost artix family retiring the spartan brand which ends with the xilinx series  fpgas in april  the company introduced the vivado design suite  a nextgeneration socstrength design environment for advanced electronic system designs in may  the company shipped the first of the next generation fpgas the  nm ultrascale technologyedit the spartan platform was the industry’s first nm fpga delivering more functionality and bandwidth per dollar than was previously possible setting new standards in the programmable logic industry xilinx designs develops and markets programmable logic products including integrated circuits ics software design tools predefined system functions delivered as intellectual property ip cores design services customer training field engineering and technical support xilinx sells both fpgas and cplds for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as communications industrial consumer automotive and data processing xilinxs fpgas have been used for the alice a large ion collider experiment at the cern european laboratory on the frenchswiss border to map and disentangle the trajectories of thousands of subatomic particles xilinx has also engaged in a partnership with the united states air force research laboratory’s space vehicles directorate to develop fpgas to withstand the damaging effects of radiation in space which are  times less sensitive to space radiation than the commercial equivalent for deployment in new satellites the virtexii pro virtex virtex and virtex fpga families which include up to two embedded ibm powerpc cores are targeted to the needs of systemonchip soc designers xilinx fpgas can run a regular embedded os such as linux or vxworks and can implement processor peripherals in programmable logic xilinxs ip cores include ip for simple functions bcd encoders counters etc for domain specific cores digital signal processing fft and fir cores to complex systems multigigabit networking cores the microblaze soft microprocessor and the compact picoblaze microcontroller xilinx also creates custom cores for a fee the main design toolkit xilinx provides engineers is the vivado design suite an integrated design environment ide with a systemtoic level tools built on a shared scalable data model and a common debug environment vivado includes electronic system level esl design tools for synthesizing and verifying cbased algorithmic ip standards based packaging of both algorithmic and rtl ip for reuse standards based ip stitching and systems integration of all types of system building blocks and the verification of blocks and systems a free version webpack edition of vivado provides designers with a limited version of the design environment xilinxs embedded developers kit edk supports the embedded powerpc  and  cores in virtexii pro and some virtex and  chips and the microblaze core xilinxs system generator for dsp implements dsp designs on xilinx fpgas a freeware version of its eda software called ise webpack is used with some of its nonhighperformance chips xilinx is the only as of  fpga vendor to distribute a native linux freeware synthesis toolchain xilinx announced the architecture for a new arm cortexabased platform for embedded systems designers that combines the software programmability of an embedded processor with the hardware flexibility of an fpga the new architecture abstracts much of the hardware burden away from the embedded software developers point of view giving them an unprecedented level of control in the development process with this platform software developers can leverage their existing system code based on arm technology and utilize vast offtheshelf opensource and commercially available software component libraries because the system boots an os at reset software development can get under way quickly within familiar development and debug environments using tools such as arms realview development suite and related thirdparty tools eclipsebased ides gnu the xilinx software development kit and others in early  xilinx began shipping a new device family based on this architecture the zynq soc platform immerses arm multicores programmable logic fabric dsp data paths memories and io functions in a dense and configurable mesh of interconnect the platform targets embedded designers working on market applications that require multifunctionality and realtime responsiveness such as automotive driver assistance intelligent video surveillance industrial automation aerospace and defense and nextgeneration wireless following the introduction of its  nm series fpgas xilinx revealed that several of the highestdensity parts in those fpga product lines will be constructed using multiple dies in one package employing technology developed for d construction and stackeddie assemblies the company’s stacked silicon interconnect ssi technology stacks several three or four active fpga dies sidebyside on a silicon interposer – a single piece of silicon that carries passive interconnect the individual fpga dies are conventional and are flipchip mounted by microbumps on to the interposer the interposer provides direct interconnect between the fpga dies with no need for transceiver technologies such as highspeed serdes in october  xilinx shipped the first fpga to use the new technology the virtex t fpga which includes  billion transistors and  million asic gates the following spring xilinx used the d technology to ship the virtex ht the industry’s first heterogeneous fpgas which combine high bandwidth fpgas with up to sixteen  gbits and seventytwo  gbits transceivers to reduce power and size requirements for key nxg and g line card applications and functions in january  xilinx acquired design tool firm autoesl design technologies and added system c highlevel design for its  and series fpga families the addition of autoesl tools extends the design community for fpgas to designers more accustomed to designing at a higher level of abstraction using c c and system c in april  xilinx introduced a redesign of its toolset for programmable systems called vivado design suite this ip and systemcentric design software supports newer high capacity devices and speeds the design of programmable logic and io vivado provides faster integration and implementation for programmable systems into devices with d stacked silicon interconnect technology arm processing systems analog mixed signal ams and many semiconductor intellectual property ip cores current family linesedit cpld xilinx xcxl prior to  xilinx offered two main fpga families the highperformance virtex series and the highvolume spartan series with a cheaper easypath option for ramping to volume production the company also provides two cpld lines the coolrunner and the  series each model series has been released in multiple generations since its launch with the introduction of its  nm fpgas in june  xilinx replaced the highvolume spartan family with the kintex family and the lowcost artix family in newer fpga products xilinx minimizes total power consumption by the adoption of a highk metal gate hkmg process which allows for low static power consumption at the  nm node static power is a significant portion of the total power dissipation of a device and in some cases is the dominant factor through the use of a hkmg process xilinx has reduced power use while increasing logic capacity virtex and spartan fpga families are said to consume  percent less power and have up to twice the logic capacity compared to the previous generation of xilinx fpgas in june  xilinx introduced the xilinx  series the virtex kintex and artix families promising improvements in system power performance capacity and price these new fpga families are manufactured using tsmcs  nm hkmg process the  nm series  devices feature a  percent power reduction compared to the companys  nm devices and offer capacity of up to  million logic cells less than one year after announcing the  series  nm fpgas xilinx shipped the world’s first  nm fpga device the kintex making this the programmable industry’s fastest product rollout in march  xilinx introduced the zynq family which integrates a complete arm cortexa mpcore processorbased system on a  nm fpga for system architects and embedded software developers in may  xilinx expanded the  series with the production of the spartan family in dec  xilinx introduced the ultrascale series virtex ultrascale and kintex ultrascale families these new fpga families are manufactured by tsmc in its  nm planar process at the same time it announced an ultrascale soc architecture called zynq ultrascale mpsoc in tsmc  nm finfet process virtex familyedit main article virtex fpga the virtex series of fpgas have integrated features that include fifo and ecc logic dsp blocks pciexpress controllers ethernet mac blocks and highspeed transceivers in addition to fpga logic the virtex series includes embedded fixed function hardware for commonly used functions such as multipliers memories serial transceivers and microprocessor cores these capabilities are used in applications such as wired and wireless infrastructure equipment advanced medical equipment test and measurement and defense systems xilinxs most recently announced virtex the virtex  family is based on a  nm design and is reported to deliver a twofold system performance improvement at  percent lower power compared to previous generation virtex devices in addition virtex doubles the memory bandwidth compared to previous generation virtex fpgas with  mbits memory interfacing performance and over two million logic cells in  xilinx began shipping sample quantities of the virtex t d fpga which combines four smaller fpgas into a single package by placing them on a special silicon interconnection pad called an interposer to deliver  billion transistors in a single large chip the interposer provides  data pathways between the individual fpgas – roughly  to  times more than would usually be available on a board – to create a single fpga in  using the same d technology xilinx introduced initial shipments of their virtex ht fpga a heterogeneous device so called because it comprises two fpga dies and one channel gbits transceiver die in the same package the virtex family is built on a  nm process for computeintensive electronic systems and the company claims it consumes  percent less power and has  percent improved performance over competing  nm fpgas the virtex lx and the lxt are intended for logicintensive applications and the virtex sxt is for dsp applications with the virtex xilinx changed the logic fabric from fourinput luts to sixinput luts with the increasing complexity of combinational logic functions required by soc designs the percentage of combinational paths requiring multiple fourinput luts had become a performance and routing bottleneck the new sixinput lut represented a tradeoff between better handling of increasingly complex combinational functions at the expense of a reduction in the absolute number of luts per device the virtex series is a  nm design fabricated in  v tripleoxide process technology legacy virtex devices virtex virtexii virtexii pro virtex  are still available but are not recommended for use in new designs kintexedit the kintex family is the first xilinx midrange fpga family that the company claims delivers virtex family performance at less than half the price while consuming  percent less power the kintex family includes highperformance  gbits or lowercost optimized  gbits serial connectivity memory and logic performance required for applications such as high volume g optical wired communication equipment and provides a balance of signal processing performance power consumption and cost to support the deployment of long term evolution lte wireless networks artixedit the artix family delivers  percent lower power and  percent lower cost compared to the spartan family and is based on the unified virtexseries architecture xilinx claims that artix fpgas deliver the performance required to address costsensitive highvolume markets previously served by assps asics and lowcost fpgas the artix family is designed to address the small form factor and lowpower performance requirements of batterypowered portable ultrasound equipment commercial digital camera lens control and military avionics and communications equipment with the introduction of the spartan family in  which lack highbandwidth transceivers the artixs position in the xilinx costoptimized portfolio was clarified as being the transceiver optimized member zynqedit the zynq family of socs addresses highend embeddedsystem applications such as video surveillance automotivedriver assistance nextgeneration wireless and factory automation zynq integrate a complete arm cortexa mpcoreprocessorbased  nm system the zynq architecture differs from previous marriages of programmable logic and embedded processors by moving from an fpgacentric platform to a processorcentric model for software developers zynq appear the same as a standard fully featured arm processorbased systemonchip soc booting immediately at powerup and capable of running a variety of operating systems independently of the programmable logic in  xilinx introduced the zynq which integrates digital signal processing dsp to meet emerging programmable systems integration requirements of wireless broadcast medical and military applications the new zynq product family posed a key challenge for system designers because xilinx ise design software had not been developed to handle the capacity and complexity of designing with an fpga with an arm core xilinxs new vivado design suite addressed this issue because the software was developed for higher capacity fpgas and it included high level synthesis hls functionality that allows engineers to compile the coprocessors from a cbased description the axiom the worlds first digital cinema camera that is open source hardware contains a zynq a zynq  or  is included in the adapteva parallella board in october  snickerdoodle combined zynq with wifi and bluetooth spartan familyedit xilinx s spartane fpga family the spartan series targets low cost highvolume applications with a lowpower footprint eg displays settop boxes wireless routers and other applications the spartan family is built on a nanometer nm metal layer dualoxide process technology the spartan was marketed in  as a lowcost option for automotive wireless communications flatpanel display and video surveillance applications the spartan family built on the same nm process used in the other series fpgas was announced in  and became available in  unlike the artix family and the lxt members of the spartan family the spartan fpgas lack highbandwidth transceivers easypathedit because easypath devices are identical to the fpgas that customers are already using the parts can be produced faster and more reliably from the time they are ordered compared to similar competing programs a week time is guaranteed from receiving the design to mass production and no redesign or requalification are required by the customer in addition customers are free to switch production from the nonprogrammable easypath fpga to the original programmable virtex fpga if the need for design changes arises baysand provides similar service to xilinx called metalcopy metalcopy is based on baysands metal configurable standard cells mcsc and baysands asic design methodology flow metalcopy consists of taking the design from rtl to asic including synthesis physical layout timing closure test insertion build in test formal verification and static timing analysis baysand currently offers metalcopy for all fpga designs including  nm and  nm fpga devices corporate strategy and cultureedit xilinx joined the fortune ranks of the  best companies to work for in  as no  rose to no  in  and rose again to no  in  in december  gsa named xilinx the most respected public semiconductor company with  million to  billion in annual sales the award recognizes excellence through success vision and strategy in the industry origin of the company nameedit having tried to register a number of more conventional companynames and having them rejected as already taken the founders decided to deliberately create an unusual name in order to ensure that the name was accepted several legends explain the origin of the name xilinx fellow bill carter said that the name xilinx was chosen because the chemical symbol for silicon is si the xs at each end represent programmable logic blocks the linx represents programmable links that connect the logic blocks together another explanation has it that two of the founders ross freeman and jim barnett both attended the university of illinois at urbana–champaign also called the fighting illini the name allegedly originated because the company founders were two exillini hence xilinx two x illini ross freemanedit ross freeman credited with the invention of the fpga was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in  more than  years after the invention of the fpga starting in  xilinx has had an annual tradition of awarding a company employee with the ross freeman award for technical innovation in freemans memory award honorees are based on nominations for innovations that resulted in significant tangible benefit to the company finalists are chosen by a committee and winners are selected based on a vote competitionedit today xilinx customers represent just over half of
