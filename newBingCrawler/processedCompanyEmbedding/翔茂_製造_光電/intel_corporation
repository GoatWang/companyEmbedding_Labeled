intel can try to juice growth is to bring out new and compelling products new products not only give potential customers reasons to upgrade their current hardware infrastructure but with sufficient feature and performance additions as well as sensible product segmentation efforts the company can also try to boost its processor average selling prices sometime this summer intel is expected to launch its nextgeneration server processor platform known as purley with purley intel not only promises to bring faster processors to the table but its also promising a whole slew of new feature additions to the platform intels first revision of the purley platform should be the main driver of the companys dcg revenue over the next year though the company has indicated there are several such revisions in the pipeline itll be interesting to see how this one affects dcgs business performance eighthgeneration core in the second half of this year  probably in the fall  intel is expected to launch its eighthgeneration core processor family for some types of notebook and desktop personal computers intel is expected to launch a product known as kaby lakerefresh for notebook personal computers these chips will include four processor cores and be manufactured in a new nanometer technology potentially providing a significant performance upgrade over the current kaby lake useries notebook chips that have just two processor cores and are manufactured in the companys less powerful nanometer technology intel is also expected to launch its first coffee lake processors for the enthusiast portion of the desktop personal computer market these chips are also expected to be manufactured in the companys nanometer technology and include up to six processor cores up from the four processor cores currently available in the enthusiastoriented kaby lake processors intel has indicated that to keep its personal computer processor average selling prices robust it aims to release new products at an annual clip that offer improved performance features and integration those highcore count core x chips although intel has formally announced its entire core x processor lineup for highend desktop personal computers only the chips with between four and  cores are currently available for preorder intel says a core x processor with  cores will arrive in august while variants with   and  cores will launch in october while the  to core parts are certainly niche products that are likely to sell in rather small quantities they should be rather lucrative for the company furthermore since the products are being released in multiple phases intel gets multiple opportunities to launch products build buzz for the new chips as well as the rest of the chips in the product line and so

intel corporation built this controversial product  the motley fool skip to main content the motley fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search heres why intel corporation built this controversial product its all about margins ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jul   at pm on may  microprocessor giant intel nasdaqintc announced its core x series of processors and the accompanying x platform for highend desktop personal computers the lineup consists of two distinct families of processors the first is skylakex which comes in configurations with as few as six processor cores and as many as  processor cores though the core models are slated to become available later intel executive gregory bryant image source intel the second is kaby lakex which includes a fourcorefourthread chip in the form of the core ix and a fourcoreeightthread chip in the form of the core ix the kaby lakex chips are quite controversial among many in the technology community because they are merely the same core i and core ik chips the launched back in january respectively but repackaged to work in the more expensive x motherboards rather than the lowercost z motherboards heres why i think intel chose to release these chips the entrylevel x parts intel clearly wanted to have entry level parts for its highend desktop platform and there are certainly good reasons to want them for example an individual building a computer around the x platform might want a computer now but may not have enough money for the higher core count part that they may eventually want so a reasonable option for that customer would be to build the system with a relatively lowcost stop gap part and then at some point down the line upgrade to something better image source intel alternatively customers might simply want the featurescapabilities that the core ikcore ik offer but would like to pair them with more featurepacked motherboards buying a x or a x and pairing it with an x motherboard highend desktop motherboards tend to be more featurerich on average than mainstream desktop motherboards would be a good solution for such a potential buyer now you might be thinking that it might make more sense for intel to simply offer quadcore versions of the skylakex chips than to do the work to bring the mainstream kaby lakes chips over to the x platform but it doesnt two big reasons the first reason that intel likely didnt simply offer a quadcore skylakex part as the entrylevel chip for x is economics the skylakex parts are based on two silicon die the first is intels lcc chip which has  cores and the second is the companys hcc chip which has  cores on the die per instlatx on social media the chip size of the lcc skylakex is north of  square millimeters intel would have to disable a substantial portion of this large expensivetomanufacture chip if it wanted to use it to offer quadcore parts on the x platform thats not good for intels product margins particularly as its unlikely that its manufacturing yields on its nanometer technology are bad enough that it produces many parts with six defective cores  by contrast intels quadcore kaby lake die measures in at around  square millimeters in the same nanometer technology that the skylakex parts are manufactured in now much of that die area is taken up by a graphics processor thats disabled but even with that part of the chip turned off the chip is still small enough to begin with and sells for a hefty enough sum that kaby lakex represents a financial win for intel and one more thing a final reason that the kaby lakex processors make more sense than a heavily disabled skylakex part is intels segmentation strategy the kaby lakex chips only have  pci express lanes on the silicon die while the lowestend sixcore skylakex has  of its  usable lanes enabled so intels sales pitch to customers then is that they can have  more cores and  more pci express lanes for about  more than the top kaby lakex part this intel probably hopes will encourage upsell to the sixcore part ultimately enriching its product mix ashraf eassa
