products sign in  register close sign in here register search close home  power products  power management this article was posted on  design interleaving pfc boost power stages here are the some tips on choosing the best overall control technique for pfc interleaving requirementsby steve mappusfairchild semiconductorsouth portland mehttpwwwfairchildsemicominterleaving isolated and nonisolated power stages is a well understood design technique within the power supply design industry by far the most widely applied interleaved topology is the multiphase buck commonly chosen as the power architecture used to meet fast load transient demands of today’s highperformance microprocessors and digital signal processors interleaving two or more synchronous buck power stages increases the amount of power that can be delivered to the load but also can decrease the required input and output capacitance furthermore the output inductors used in each phase of an interleaved synchronous buck can be much smaller because of the ripple current cancellation effect seen at the output capacitor interleaving enables converter designs consisting of smaller output inductors and lower output capacitance necessary to meet fast transient requirements as high as  aµsalthough the motivation for interleaving is quite different compared to synchronous bucks interleaved power factor correction pfc boost power stages can benefit from many of the same principles determined primarily by the inductor current the pfc boost can be classified into one of three operating modes continuous conduction mode ccm critical conduction mode crm or discontinuous conduction mode dcm as a general guideline for singlephaseonly operation ccm pfc is chosen for higherpower applications greater than  w ccm pfc operates using fixed frequency average current mode pulsewidth modulation pwm control that forces the average input current to be proportional to the rectified ac line voltage in order for the input current to remain continuous over the entire ac line cycle pfc boost stages operating in ccm require a large input inductor making them suitable for highpower applications due to their lower peak currents although the peak ripple current is lower it should be noted that the ccm pfc operates as a hard switching converter resulting in higher switching losses and significant reverse recovery losses in the output rectifier however the continuous input current tends to ease the burden of designing the front end emi filter necessary for reducing harmonic distortioncrm uses a fixed on time variable frequency control technique operating at the zero crossing boundary between the dcm and ccm modes of operation compared to ccm operation at similar power levels crm offers some desirable benefits for applications up to approximately  w since the boost inductor current always returns to zero before the start of each switching cycle the main mosfet turns on under zero current switching conditions while the output diode turns off under zero current switching zero current turnoff in the output rectifier is especially beneficial since it minimizes the losses associated with reverse recovery allowing the use of a lessexpensive output rectifier diode the high peak inductor ripple current translates to a much smaller input inductor at the cost of increased mosfet turnoff losses and higher emi filter requirements when crm control is applied to an interleaved pfc power supply the limitations associated with high peak inductor current typical of a single phase design are somewhat overcome this allows the power level to be extended closer or even beyond the kw range and reduces the size of the emi filter while retaining all the benefits that make crm attractiveinterleaving two or more pfc boost power stages can be accomplished using either of the pfc operating modes mentioned above shown in fig  is an example of a dc input dual phase interleaved boost converter using two individual boost power stages labeled φ and φ respectively as noted by pwm and pwm each power stage is operating  out of phase at a fixed pwm frequency however the peaktopeak ripple currents iin and iout are switching at an effective frequency of twice the pwm frequency since iin  il  il and iout  iφ  iφ maximum ripple current cancellation occurs when the duty cycle d is fixed at d   d   or d   as shown in fig  when d   the iin ac ripple current is ideally app and the iout ac ripple current is minimally reduced to the sum of the ac currents flowing through d and d even for the instance where d   and d   shown in fig  there is still a worsecase ripple current reduction that is  better compared to a single phase design and since the output ac ripple current flows through the output capacitor any current reduction is directly realized in the form of power dissipation savings due to ioutxresrfor interleaved synchronous buck converters the input and output voltage is relatively fixed which means the duty cycle will have little variation the higher effective frequency and reduced rms ripple current permits the use of lower capacitor values for cin and cout in a multiphase buck converter but for an interleaved pfc boost the considerations are quite differentfig  dualphase ccm interleaved pfc waveformsin a pfc boost application the ac line voltage is varying and the output voltage is regulated dc so the duty cycle constantly changes which means the amount of ripple current cancellation is also varying within every line cycle even though the average rms current is reduced for most pfc applications the output capacitor is chosen according the holdup requirement that the output voltage must be regulated to a minimal dc value during the loss of one or more ac line cycles therefore regardless of how much ripple current cancellation occurs the first consideration given to the output capacitor is that of energy storage in some singlephase pfc applications the required cout value may dictate the need for two or more parallel capacitors in order to meet rms ripple current ratings for these marginal cases there may be instances where the benefits of interleaving could result in using one less capacitorfurther benefits of interleaving include use of smaller low profile inductors within the pfc power supply and emi filter which is critical in space conscious applications such as flat panel televisions and monitors also because the current is shared between the two parallel phases the conduction losses are lower and power dissipation is spread out over a wider area which can reduce the thermal mass required by heat sinking lower conduction losses help increase full load efficiency but the extra mosfet and output diode increase frequency related switching losses decreasing light load efficiency for applications where light load efficiency is a concern phase shedding can be implemented phase shedding is a technique originally applied to multiphase synchronous buck converters when the load current decreases to the point where switching losses begin to dominate over conduction losses additional phases are disabled to minimize the cumulative switching losses otherwise present when all phases are operatingthe popularity of pfc interleaving is driven by the necessity for higher efficiency higher power density and better emi performance assisted by the recent introduction of several analog control ics targeting these applications varying complex system requirements also pose an interesting challenge for optimizing efficiency and performance using analog pfc controllers interleaving power stages at high power levels is a nontrivial design task especially when considering complex modes of operation such as startup shutdown wide input range and fault protection and recovery therefore for some applications the programmable functionality and flexibility of a digital control approach might also be considered so while interest levels in interleaving seem to be growing it’s up to the ic manufacturers to provide the best overall control solution along with the correct set of features in order to gain wide market acceptancefor more on power supplies visit httpwwwelectronicproductscompowerasp learn more about fairchild semiconductor related articles this paperthin material doesn’t just generate
