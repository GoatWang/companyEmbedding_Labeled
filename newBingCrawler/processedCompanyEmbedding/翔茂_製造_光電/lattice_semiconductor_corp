interface hdmidvi video interface related products ecp  ecpg latticeecp dvi digital visual interface and hdmi highdefinition multimedia interface have emerged as the dominant standards for connecting digital display devices like a pc monitor and hdtv dvi only carries uncompressed video data whereas hdmi can transfer both uncompressed digital video and multichannel audio over a single cable developed specifically to address the unique requirements of the consumer electronics market hdmi offers additional enhancements including the support of the ycbcr color space format and the universal remote control capability through consumer electronics control cec protocol hdmienabled display devices are backwardcompatible with dvibased pcs so users can display the pc contents on their hdtv dvi is a video interface standard created by the digital display working group ddwg to replace the legacy analog vga connector standard it is designed for carrying uncompressed digital video data to a display this reference design focuses on dvid mode dvi handles a singlelink bandwidth up to mhz and thus supports uxga and hdtv with resolutions up to  x  at hz higher resolutions can be supported with reduced blanking periods or with a duallink connection hdmi is an industrysupported alldigital audiovideo interface for transmitting both uncompressed digital video and multichannel audio over a single connector and cable that replaces various cables behind the home entertainment center hdmi can carry eight channels of khz bit uncompressed audio or any flavor of compressed audio format such as dolby or dts hdmi has the capacity to support existing highdefinition video formats such as p i and p because hdmi is electrically compatible with the dvi signal no signal conversion is required nor is there a loss of video quality when a dvitohdmi adapter is used reference designs two separate reference designs are implemented for demonstration features the hdmi interface features the dvi interface both reference designs have been validated using the latticeecp video protocol board and hdmi mezzanine card the reference design consists of the hdmi transmitter and receiver cores which are compatible with both hdmi and dvi physical layer protocols you can use this design to evaluate the serdesbased hdmidvi physical layer solution for your specific application hdmi loopback demonstration in the loopback demonstration the incoming hdmi signal is split into the video and data components and looped back through the output in addition to this various maipulations are possible on both the data as well as the video features serdesbased dvi and hdmi interface supports data rate up to gbps shared tmds encoder and decoder for both dvi and hdmi data supports arbitrary
