between locations typical uses include sharing files such as photos with other computers and creating backup copies of files and folders details notethere are multiple files available for this downloadonce you click on the download button you will be prompted to select the files you need versionfile namesynctoysetuppackagevxexesynctoysetuppackagevxexedate publishedfile size mb mb overview there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras email cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to files and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder synctoy is powered by the latest synchronization engine from microsoft sync framework  and provides better performance and robustness the new features and improvements included in synctoy  release are better performance the speed of file copy operations is significantly increased across the board improved robustness much more resilient to transient network and file system errors and better error reporting which pinpoints which file the sync failed on in case there’s a fatal error that stops the sync folder pair configuration backup folder pair configuration is automatically backed up under localappdatamicrosoftsynctoy user can replace synctoydirpairsbin with the backup copy to resolve last saved configuration bug fixes fixed the data corruption issue when using synctoy with nas drives fixed the issue that prevented uploading files to sharepoint when using synctoy  fixed the issue that prevented delete changes from being synchronized when the sync option is set to “echo” fixed the ui issue where reported file time were off by the difference between local time and utc when destination is a fat volume the major new features and improvements included in previous synctoy  release are dynamic drive letter assignment drive letter reassignment will now be detected and updated in the folder pair definition true folder sync folder creates renames and deletes are now synchronized for all synctoy actions exclusion filtering based on name file exclusion based on name with exact or fuzzy matching filtering based on file attributes the ability to exclude files based on one or more file attributes readonly system hidden unattended folder pair execution addressed issues related to running scheduled folder pairs while logged off folder pairs with shared endpoints ability for folder pairs associated with the same or different instances of synctoy to share endpoints command line enhancements added the ability to manage folder pairs via the command line interface rearchitect sync engine the synctoy engine has been rearchitected to provide scalability and the ability to add significant enhancements in future releases sync engine is also more robust insomuch that many single file level errors are skipped without affecting the entire sync operation sync encrypted files sync of encrypted files works when local folder and files are encrypted which addresses the common scenario involving sync between local encrypted laptop pc folder and remote unencrypted desktop pc folder bit support synctoy now has a native bit build x only for bit versions of windows folder pair rename subfolder exclusion enhancements descendents created under excluded subfolders are automatically excluded usability improvements for the subfolder exclusion dialog folder pair metadata moved folder pair metadata removed from mydocuments to resolve any issues with serverbased folder pair redirection setup setup improvements integrated setup with single selfextracting archive file and no extra

using the synctoy  file synchronization forum listed below note weve taken great care to ensure that this tool operates as it should but it is not part of windows and is not supported by microsoft technical support for this reason microsoft technical support is unable to answer questions about synctoy to speak to other users and contribute feedback about your experiences with synctoy please use

equivalent mb ram mb ram recommended mb free disk space install instructions download synctoy by clicking on the download button below synctoy installation notes upgrade  if upgrading from an earlier version of synctoy eg synctoy  or synctoy  it is critical to ensure that all folder pairs are fully synchronized using the previous version before running synctoy  setup not following this guideline can lead to unintended behavior and partial data loss when running synctoy  for the first time after upgrade all folder pairs must also be fully synchronized at least once right after the upgrade is done installation  uninstallation  both bit and bit versions of synctoy are available as a single selfextracting archive executable which runs all of the required setup components when launched the bit version is targeted to bit versions of windows eg windows xp x edition windows vista bit editions and windows  x edition  the bit version may be installed and run on a bit version of windows as well  simultaneous sidebyside installation of the bit and bit versions on the same machine is not recommended or supported  synctoy  supports quiet installation by an administrator user on the target machine the steps for this are as follows please download the selfextracting archive executable and save locally extract files from the archive to a target directory youll notice  msi files in the set of extracted files each of the  msis can be run in quiet mode using the msi command line utility msiexecexe the order in which the msis need to be installed is synchronizationmsi providerservicesmsi synctoysetupmsi  synctoy  depends on components of the microsoft sync framework  which are included in synctoy setup installing synctoy along with these dependent components requires the use of an account with administrator privileges on the target machine if the microsoft sync framework  components are already installed on the target machine synctoy can be installed from a nonadministrator user account  the synctoy application will stop working if any of the dependent components are uninstalled which can be fixed by rerunning the full install package on the target machine  if synctoy  is installed using an account which is different than the one that was used to install previous versions of synctoy then the previous version will not be uninstalled in this case it is recommended that users uninstall the previous version using the previously used user account before installing synctoy   if uninstalling synctoy  the same user account must be used which was used for installation
