executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin

telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been comanufacturing flash memory with amd since  amd divested itself of spansion in december  in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo acquisition of atiedit amd announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july   amd paid  billion in cash and  million shares of its stock for a total of approximately  billion the transaction completed on october   on august   amd announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name in october  amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibilliondollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi the new venture is called globalfoundries inc the partnership and spinoff gave amd an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new ventures success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of amd in july  while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of global foundries in march  president and coo dirk meyer became amds ceo recessionary losses necessitated amd cutting  jobs in  in august  amd announced that former lenovo executive rory read would be joining the company as ceo replacing meyer amd announced in november  plans to lay off more than   of its employees from across all divisions worldwide in october  it announced plans to lay off an additional  of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue amd acquired the lowpower server manufacturer seamicro in early  with an eye to bringing out an arm architecture server chip on october   amd announced that rory read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer he was succeeded by lisa su a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since june on october   amd announced a new restructuring plan along with its q results effective july   amd reorganized into two business groups computing and graphics which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets discrete gpus and professional graphics and enterprise embedded and semicustom which primarily

anthropomorphization of them as superman the numeral  refers to the fifth generation of x processors rival intel had previously introduced its line of fifthgeneration x processors as pentium because the us trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked in  amd purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of xcompatible processors amd gave the nexgen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the nx the result was the k processor introduced in  although the k was based on socket  variants such as k were faster than intels pentium ii sixthgeneration processor the k was amds seventhgeneration x processor making its debut on june   under the brand name athlon unlike previous amd processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intels due to licensing issues surrounding intels slot  connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus the duron was a lowercost and limited version of the athlon kb instead of kb l cache in a pin socketed pga socket a or soldered directly onto the motherboard sempron was released as a lowercost athlon xp replacing duron in the socket a pga era it has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to am on october   the athlon xp was released on february   the athlon xp with kb l cache was released athlon  opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x amd or x the incorporation of an onchip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance pointtopoint interconnect called hypertransport as part of the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third generation opteron processors followed in november by the phenom processor for desktop k processors came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore versions with all cores on a single die amd released a new platform codenamed spider which utilized the new phenom processor as well as an r gpu and a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series however amd built the spider at nm which was uncompetitive with intels smaller and more powerefficient nm in january  amd released a new processor line dubbed phenom ii a refresh of the original phenom built using the  nm process amds new platform codenamed “dragon” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r gpu from the r gpu family as well as a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series the phenom ii came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triplecore and dualcore versions the phenom ii resolved issues that the original phenom had including a low clock speed a small l cache and a coolnquiet bug that decreased performance the phenom ii cost less but was not performancecompetitive with intels midtohighrange core  quads the phenom ii also enhanced the phenoms memory controller allowing it to use ddr in a new native socket am while maintaining backwards compatibility with am the socket used for the phenom and allowing the use of the ddr memory that was used with the platform
