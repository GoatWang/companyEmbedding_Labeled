mature startupaug   about blackberry ltd bbry renars g longshort equity mediumterm horizonsummarytaking into account the current situation blackberry is in i believe that it has to be valued more like a startupthe revenue of blackberry has been falling but should bottom in around  years timethere are other projects on which blackberry has been working on which are going to bring a lot of value in the futurepressure from the investors could force the management to make shortsighted decisionsgiven the product portfolio blackberry has to offer it is a viable buyout targeti came across blackberry bbry at the very end of  way before it had received the settlement from qualcomm qcom at first i was rather skeptical but just out of curiosity i decided to have a look what i found is in my opinion a great investment opportunity that thanks to its broad product portfolio is a great buyout target which was not noticed by the general public i still think that the company is misunderstoodunnoticed and has a lot of upside blackberry used to manufacture phones which is what it is famous for it is not surprising that most people still view it as a mobile phone manufacturer blackberry phones used to be everywhere nowadays hardware revenue makes up only  of blackberry’s total revenue and might i mention that the hardware revenue it currently receives mostly comes from licensing fees such a misconception strips blackberry of potential investments as people are not willing to invest in a dying phone manufacturer  something that blackberry has not been for a while now well what does blackberry do now they have turned to software and are growing their software revenue at  yearoveryear source blackberry investor relations one can easily tell the moment blackberry started focusing on software rather than hardware both software revenue and hardware revenue are pretty selfexplainatory what puzzled me is the three letter combination saf as it turns out saf or software access fees are fees that the subscribers of listen to this blackberry  are billed for now bb is a mobile operating system released in  and i reckon it is quite obvious that the number of professionals using it is rapidly decreasing another very discouraging thing can be observed in the graph – the revenue of blackberry has been falling like a rock bbry revenue quarterly data by ycharts as long as revenue is declining most run of the mill investors are not going to even want to look at this stock even though the gross margins are improving and the company is generating profits bbry gross profit margin quarterly data by ycharts where is the turning point many estimations can be made and i might be very wrong but after making the following assumptions software revenue grows at  yearoveryear  under the current growth rate the software revenue increased from  million to  million or  the other revenue saf hardware and other continues to fall at  a year which is the average rate they have fallen at for the last  years the estimation i came to is that bottoming of the revenue should be seen in  this means that in the shortterm investors have to be patient and hold onto their stock in other words  keep their eyes on the prize however there are a couple of factors that were not taken into account when trying to estimate the turnaround point of the revenue and should be considered  blackberry keyone is a hit as it is reportedly sold out on some sites having a positive impact on hardware revenues  as of today other than buying back shares blackberry still has not announced what are they going to do with the extraordinary large amount of cash that they are sitting on  other initiatives of blackberry all of the aforementioned factors have the ability to shorten the amount of time it will take for the revenue to change direction personally i find the second and third factor the most influential as they create new sources of revenue wait what other initiatives another division of blackberry is called “blackberry technology solutions” which includes operations like qnx and blackberry radar qnx is a secure operating system for car infotainment systems and gauge clusters it also enables autonomous driving which is where with the latest trends of the car industry the real value is according to the website of qnx over  million cars use qnx today blackberry radar on the other hand is a transportation asset management devicesoftware radar lets the companies using it track the location the current environmental situation temperature humidity and the door status of their containers chassis and trailers best of all the data collected is available on the secure blackberry iot internet of things platform i would like you to pay attention to the last part of the previous sentence – companies using it would have to use the blackberry platform giving blackberry the opportunity to introduce their software in the company after the companies have grown accustomed to the software it would be easier for bb to sell them on the idea of using more of their software products john chen said that marketing is an area on which blackberry is starting to focus on more  proving that its software creates added values would be a great way for blackberry to get their foot in the door of larger companies reportedly blackberry radar is currently in the testing phase by big players in the transportation space when i say “big players” i mean fedex is testing radar for their “critical operations” something that cnbc forgot to ask during the short interview with john chen after the last earnings were reported im pleased to announce that fedex has chosen radar for its custom critical services the general understanding is that companies would have to pay upfront for the hardware and then monthly subscription payments would have to be made the price has not been decided on yet taking into account the fact that radar is still being tested no investor should expect to see tangible results in the very near future however i see it as an amazingly valuable product once it starts getting used by the masses i suspect that the aforementioned product is going to have an impact on the topline the question is  when i believe that there are two possible scenarios it might make the revenue turnaround moment come sooner it might start having a significant effect on the revenue at approximately the same moment as the software revenue starts growing enough to offset the decay of other revenues if that is the case the turnaround is going to be more distinct and violent to the doubtful shorts as for what they are going to do with the cash received from the qualcomm settlement they might as well acquire something that would not only boost their revenue in the shortterm but also create added value for new customers which in turn would have a longterm impact on the topline main worries all things aside i completely understand the logic behind selling shares of a company that has declining revenue however and this has to be considered by anyone looking at blackberry the new products need time to gain traction and popularity the biggest challenge for this stock as i see it is investors not hanging around and dumping it before it has reached its full potential such pressure from investors is understandable but in reality it helps nobody it suppresses innovation and makes people make shortsighted decisions that would get them out of the situation worst case scenario – management makes a shortsighted acquisition which would satisfy the investors in the shortterm but would deteriorate the company as time passes nobody likes people who make unpopular decisions unfortunately for him something that john chen has to commit to – thinking longterm and waiting for the right opportunity no matter what value it as a startup that needs more time in my opinion given the current stage bb is in it is best to look at the company as a very large startup with a lot of cash albeit with a lot of debt as well how would one value a startup one would not value a startup by how much revenue it is generating at the moment one would value a startup by what it is able to achieve in the future and by its performance in the sector it is focusing on –  yearoveryear growth in the case of blackberry the best part  the canadian company has a lot up its sleeve for the future after a thorough analysis of blackberry i have reason to believe that blackberry is a target for an acquisition i say that because i have a vision of how this company should look like in the future and to me it looks like it could create a lot of value for larger more influential companies and give them an edge over the evergrowing competition one might say that blackberry is star

support helped blackberry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses during fiscal  total assets declared in the rims balance sheet grew eightfold due to massive capacity expansion global expansion and competition –edit rim soon began to introduce blackberry devices aimed towards the consumer market as well beginning with the blackberry pearl —the first blackberry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera the introduction of the pearl series was highly successful as was the subsequent curve  series and bold  extensive carrier partnerships fuelled the rapid expansion of blackberry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets despite the arrival of the first apple iphone in  blackberry sustained unprecedented market share growth well into  the introduction of apples iphone on the att network in the fall of  in the united states prompted rim to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in —the blackberry storm the storm sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction the iphone initially lagged behind the blackberry in both shipments and active users due to rims head start and larger carrier distribution network in the united states the blackberry user base peaked at approximately  million users in the fall of  that quarter the companys global subscriber base stood at  million users as the iphone and google android accelerated growth in the united states the blackberry began to turn to other smartphone platforms nonetheless the blackberry line as a whole continued to enjoy success spurred on by strong international growth as of december   the company had  million blackberry users globally with only  million remaining in the united states even as the company continued to grow worldwide investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the companys ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems ios and android analysts were also worried about the strategic direction of the coceos management structure in june  cnn released an article citing blackberry as one of six endangered uscanadian brands following numerous attempts to upgrade their existing java platform the company made numerous acquisitions to help it create a new more powerful blackberry platform centered around its recently acquired realtime operating system qnx in march  research in motion ltd’s thencoceo jim balsillie suggested during a conference call that the launch of some powerful new blackberrys eventually released as blackberry  would be in early  however analysts were worried that promoting the mysterious supposedly gamechanging devices too early might hurt sales of existing blackberrys similar to the osborne effect the initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the companys credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share on september   rim announced the longrumoured blackberry playbook tablet the first product running on the new qnx platform known as blackberry tablet os the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april   the playbook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly following the shipments of  tablets during its first three quarters on market slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by  million primary competitionedit the primary competitors of the blackberry are smartphones running android and the apple iphone with microsofts windows phone platform emerging as a more recent competitor for a number of years the blackberry was the leading smartphone in many markets particularly the united states the arrival of the apple iphone and later googles android platform caused a slowdown in blackberry growth and a decline in sales in some markets most notably the united states this led to negative media and analyst sentiment over the companys ability to continue as an independent company when apples iphone was first introduced in  it generated substantial media attention with numerous media outlets calling it a blackberry killer while blackberry sales continued to grow the newer iphone grew at a faster rate and the  percent drop in blackberrys stock price between  and  is primarily attributed to the performance of the iphone handset the first three models of the iphone introduced in  generally lagged behind the blackberry in sales as rim had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support however apple continued gaining market share in october  apple briefly passed rim in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold  million iphones to the  million sold by rim comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies though apples iphone sales declined to  million in the subsequent quarter and rims increased to  million for some investors this indicated a sign of weakness apples iphone began to sell more phones quarterly than the blackberry in  brought on by the release of the iphone  in the united states the blackberry hit its peak in september  when almost  million users or  of the  million american smartphone users at the time were using a blackberry blackberry then began to decline in use in the united states with apples installed base in the united states finally passing blackberry in april  sales of the iphone continued to accelerate as did the smartphone market while the blackberry began to lose users continuously in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  on an iphone googles android mobile operating system running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including sony motorola htc samsung lg and many others ramped up the competition for blackberry in january  barely  million  of the  million smartphones in use at the time in the united states were running android compared to  million blackberry devices  within a single year android had passed the installed base of the blackberry in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  running android while rims secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iphone and android smartphones developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the blackberry during s even enterprise customers had begun to adopt byod policies due to employee feedback the company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition and that the browsing capabilities were poorer strategic changes and restructuring –presentedit slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a layoff of  employees in the summer of  in september  the companys blackberry internet service suffered a massive outage impacting millions of customers for several days the outage embarrassingly occurred as apple prepared to launch the iphone s causing fears of mass defections from the platform shortly afterwards in october  rim unveiled bbx a new platform for future blackberry smartphones that would be based on the same qnxbased platform as the playbook however due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name bbx the platform was renamed blackberry  the task proved to be daunting with the company delaying the launch in december  to some time in  on january   mike lazaridis and jim balsillie resigned as the ceos of the company handing the reins over to executive thorsten heins on march   the company

launch which the company expected would rise to  by the time the device made its debut in the united states in support of the launch the company aired its first super bowl television advertisement in the us and canada during super bowl xlvii in discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an offtheshelf platform such as android heins noted if you look at other suppliers ability to differentiate theres very little wiggle room we looked at it seriously—but if you understand what the promise of blackberry is to its user base its all about getting stuff done games media we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game very little time to consume and enjoy content—if you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis and if we want to serve that segment we cant do it on a metoo approach chief operating officer kristian tear remarked we want to regain our position as the number one in the world while chief marketing officer frank boulben proclaimed it could be the greatest comeback in tech history the carriers are behind us they dont want a duopoly referring to apple and samsung during the blackberry  launch event the company also announced that it would change its public brand from research in motion to blackberry the name change was made to put the blackberry brand at the centre of
