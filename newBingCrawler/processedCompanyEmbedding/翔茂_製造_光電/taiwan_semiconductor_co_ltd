semiconductor companies such as apple inc qualcomm nvidia advanced micro devices amd mediatek marvell stmicroelectronics and broadcom are customers of tsmc as well as emerging players such as spreadtrum appliedmicro allwinner technology and hisilicon and many smaller companies leading programmable logic device companies xilinx and altera also make use of tsmcs foundry services some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like intel and texas instruments outsource some of their production to tsmc at least one semiconductor company lsi resells tsmc wafers through its asic design services and design ipportfolio the company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for most of its existence although influenced by the demand cycles of the semiconductor industry in  the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost  to nt billion in an effort to fend off growing competition the company also planned to expand capacity by  in  to meet strong market demand in may  tsmcs board of directors approved capital appropriations of us million to establish convert and upgrade advanced technology capacity after the company forecast higher than expected demand in august  tsmcs board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of us billion in  it was reported that tsmc had begun trial production of the a soc and a socs for apples ipad and iphone devices according to reports as of may  apple is sourcing its new a and ax socs from tsmc and later sourced the a soc with both tsmc and samsungto increase volume for iphone s launch with the ax being exclusively made by tsmc thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes apple has become tsmcs most important customer tsmcs market capitalization reached a value of nt trillion us billion in december  it was ranked th in the ft global   list of the worlds most highly valued companies with a

semiconductor foundry located in camas washington usa it is the largest pureplay foundry in the united states the facility employs  workerscitation needed wafertech was established in june  as a joint venture with tsmc altera analog devices and issi as key partners the four companies along with minor individual investors invested us billion into this venture which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of washington the company started production in july  in its  mm  inch semiconductor fabrication plant its first product was a  micrometer part for alteracitation

exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry during upturns tsmc must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand however during downturns it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities as a result the companys financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years this is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth tsmcs business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in q and a low in q in  tsmc was at the forefront of the foundry industry for highperformance lowpower applications leading major smartphone chip companies such as qualcomm mediatek and apple to place an increasing amount of orders while the competitors in the foundry industry primarily globalfoundries and united microelectronics corporation have encountered difficulties ramping leadingedge  nm capacity the leading integrated device manufacturers such as samsung and intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications for most of  tsmc saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand primarily due to chips for smartphone applications tsmc raised its financial guidance in march  and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ firstquarter results for q  revenues came in at nt billion with  nanometer technology business growing more than  from the previous quarter lead times for chip orders at tsmc increased due to a tight capacity situation putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules and in august  it was reported that tsmcs production capacity for the fourth quarter of  was already almost fully booked a scenario that had not occurred for many years which was described as being due to a rippleeffect due to tsmc landing cpu orders from apple however monthly sales for  peaked in october decreasing by  in november due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers tsmcs revenue for  saw growth of  over the previous year while tsmc has forecast that revenue for  will grow by  to  percent from  thanks to strong demand for its  nm process new  nm finfet process technology as well as continuing demand
