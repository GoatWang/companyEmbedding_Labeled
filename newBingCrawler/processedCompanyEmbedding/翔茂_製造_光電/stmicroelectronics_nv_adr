microelectronics in june  from merger of sgs microelettronica italy and thomson semiconducteurs france renamed stmicroelectronics in may  product portfolio st’s products are found everywhere today and together with our customers we are enabling smarter driving and smarter homes factories and cities along with the next generation of mobile and internet of things devices smart driving safer greener more connected it is estimated that  of all innovations in the automotive industry today are directly or indirectly enabled by electronics which means a constant increase in the semiconductor content per car year after year st’s smart driving products and solutions are making driving safer greener and more connected through the fusion of several of our technologies driving is safer thanks to our advanced driver assistance systems adas products – vision radar imaging and sensors as well as our adaptive lighting systems and user display technologies driving is greener with our energymanagement

cartocar and cartoinfrastructure vx connectivity solutions infotainment system and telematics processors gnss positioning technologies tuners amplifiers and sensors the internet of things solutions for smarter personal devices homes cities and factories due to the fragmented nature of the internet of things the markets we serve span our entire customer base – from our largest customers to the tens of thousands of smaller and equally important customers we serve through our distribution partners and massmarket initiatives our daily lives as individuals benefit from the “smart things” we carry and use extensively st is a leading supplier of many of the key technologies going into the next generations of personal consumer devices sensors and actuators microcontrollers for low and ultralow power processing secure solutions power and analog components and rf  connectivity products st makes developing prototypes fast and affordable with a range of development ecosystems including its stm open development environment st addresses the rise of the smart home and smart city systems through their core energy consumption and management systems or the future smart grids and their applications its solutions address the critical functions combo chips inside the smart meters that help consumers and utilities track and balance electricity water and gas consumption and billing more intelligent street lighting that senses its environment and dims or switches off to adjust to lighting conditions and municipal needs and sensors that measure traffic flow and can reroute around obstructions st also provides technologies that enable manufacturing and other industrial sectors to achieve better efficiency flexibility and safety through automation and robotics – what we call smart industry the current shift often labelled the “fourth industrial revolution” is making industrial systems smarter with the combined application of a broad range of products including microcontrollers sensors and actuators motor control signal conditioning industrial communication solutions secure solutions power supplies protection devices wireless modules and display and led controllers research  development and manufacturing to keep its technology edge st has maintained an unwavering commitment to rd from the beginning with approximately  people working in rd and product design and spent about  of its revenue in rd in  among the industry’s most innovative companies st owns and continuously refreshes a substantial patent library  owned patents in  patent families and
