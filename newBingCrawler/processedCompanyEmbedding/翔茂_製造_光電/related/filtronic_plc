increasing by  percent yearonyear to gbpm  gbpm returning the group to profitability  successfully fulfilled the large order for ultra wide band antennas from a world leading mobile telecommunications infrastructure oem demonstrating our ability to introduce new products and rapidly ramp to volume production  strong demand for filter products to mobile telecommunications infrastructure and public safety communications markets in the year expected to continue into fy  investment in the sales and marketing teams across emea and the us resulting in a growing opportunity pipeline  major contract win for filtronic broadband to a tier  european defence equipment supplier to manufacture their advanced radar transmit receive modules broadening the customer base and markets we serve  encouraging customer engagement in a broad range of markets including major silicon valley technology companies who see the value in our mmwave technology commenting on the outlook reg gott chairman said both our filtronic wireless and filtronic broadband businesses have made excellent progress over the past year toward our key strategic objectives of broadening our customer base and expanding our product portfolio in order to widen our addressable market and return the company to profit notwithstanding this progress we are still in the early stages of this strategy and the bulk of our revenues will remain concentrated across a small number of customers in the mobile telecommunications infrastructure market for the near term following several years of growth in mobile infrastructure investment we note recent market announcements by nokia and ericsson that  may be slightly more challenging than they previously expected however we remain confident in our underlying strategy as market focus increasingly turns to g network densification and the nascent g opportunity to meet ever growing data capacity demand we are confident these trends will play to our core strengths and position us well to capitalise on these opportunities as both g densification and g technology requirements align with our growing activities in the defence public safety and satellite communications segments of the market annual general meeting the annual general meeting will take place on  september  at the offices of panmure gordon  co one new change london ecm af filtronic plc tel    reg gott chairman  rob smith ceo panmure gordon uk limited tel    dominic morley  alina vaskina walbrook pr ltd tel    paul cornelius or filtronicwalbrookprcom helen cresswell note this announcement contains inside information which is disclosed in accordance with the market abuse regulation chairmans letter the year under review was one of considerable progress as the group increased revenue and returned to profitability the board is very pleased with the progress made to date with the improved trading being a direct result of the more focussed strategy and reduced cost base that have been implemented over the past two financial years the success in the year was initially down to sales of our ultra wide band integrated antennas to a tier  telecoms customer backed up by a growth in demand for a broader range of filter products across the telecommunications and public safety markets the markets we serve and the technologies we offer are changing rapidly product lifecycles are compressing and this means that we are constantly refining our product and operating strategies to adapt to the evolving environment to successfully develop the business we recognise that we must broaden our customer base enhance our product offerings and expand the market space we serve with an improved balance sheet we have been able to invest in these areas more than in recent years and we now have an exciting pipeline of new products and customer opportunities in a broader spread of market sectors financial performance summary group financial performance for the year ended ahead of our initial expectations with sales of gbpm  m an operating profit of gbpm  gbpm loss and an adjusted operating profit of gbpm  gbpm adjusted operating loss the consolidated income statement sets out the basis of calculation of the adjusted operating profit filtronic wireless business revenue was gbpm  gbpm with an operating profit of gbpm  m operating loss and an adjusted operating profit of gbpm  gbpm adjusted operating loss filtronic broadband business revenue was gbpm  gbpm with an operating loss of gbpm  gbpm operating loss and an adjusted operating loss of gbpm  gbpm adjusted operating loss the group had net cash of gbpm at the end of the year  gbpm net debt the cash generation in the year was a direct result of the improved trading performance the group maintains an invoice discounting facility in the uk with barclays bank plc of gbpm that was undrawn at the yearend and through the year had a facility of m with faunus group international inc fgi however the group decided to terminate the fgi facility in may  as the cost of the facility and its terms no longer met the business requirements we are currently reviewing our finance needs in the us with alternative debt providers to secure facilities should we need them that more closely match our needs dividend no dividend is proposed for the year  gbpnil the board periodically reviews its dividend policy and concluded that whilst cash reserves had increased substantially through the year shareholders interests would be better served by retaining the cash to fund our working capital and further investment plans than by distributing cash at this time outlook the progress made in fy has demonstrated the capability of filtronic to grow and deliver profit however the growth achieved has been with a concentrated number of customers and with relatively few products notwithstanding the growing opportunity and product pipeline we continue to remind shareholders that until there has been a further widening of the customer base growth will continue to be lumpy and difficult to forecast in the short term we also note that our major telecoms oem customers have downgraded their projections for the current financial year this underscores the importance for filtronic to continue to reduce dependence on these customers and to seek opportunities in other markets we are encouraged by the breadth of opportunities being generated and remind investors that the substantial multiyear contract win of a defence related programme underpins filtronic broadband business revenues for several years consequently the board continues to have a positive outlook for the longerterm prospects for the group the terms and impact of brexit remain unclear but the global nature of our trade should provide a good degree of shelter from the currently anticipated major changes that will likely flow from the uk leaving the european union finally i would like to thank our employees for all their hard work over the year in delivering a substantially improved performance and to thank our shareholders and bankers for their continued support reg gott chairman  july  chief executives statement fy was a strong recovery year for filtronic as the group increased sales revenues by  and returned to profitability the financial results stem from our strategic focus on servicing key markets with technically innovative products and excellence in execution to ensure we meet or exceed customer expectations for product quality and service our strategy and markets filtronic is a leading designer and manufacturer of components and subsystems used in advanced communication applications the group is organised into two independently managed business units filtronic wireless and filtronic broadband that respectively focus on rf conditioning and transceiver products our strategy is to profitably grow our business by focussing on supplying class leading rf communication components and subsystems for demanding applications across a number of target markets our key objectives are   to offer a growing range of technically advanced ultra wide band antennas mmwave transceivers and associated products  to expand our customer base within existing markets  to widen the number of markets we address our largest serviced market is the mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment market this market has seen robust levels of investment in increased capacity for glte in recent years as end user demand for services continues to grow however we note the recent reductions in current calendar year forecasts from both nokia and ericsson and we are a little more cautious regarding the short term as a consequence though remain confident in the midterm to longterm and continue to expect renewed demand growth from calendar  from the new spectrum releases the sector offers significant opportunities for volume deliveries but is highly competitive and price sensitive consequently we have focussed our efforts on offering products that are technically challenging and innovative to differentiate us from larger vertically integrated asian based suppliers in addition to the mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment market we have an established presence in public safety communications and have also recently won our first major contracts in the defence  aerospace and high speed wireless internet markets a number of new opportunities are opening up for mmwave products and these include applications in the industrial security satellite communication automotive and transportation sectors filtronic wireless filtronic wireless is a specialist designer and manufacturer of rf conditioning products supplying antennas and filters to the telecommunications infrastructure equipment and public safety communications markets the filtronic wireless business more than tripled sales revenue in the year to gbpm  gbpm with an even split of sales between antenna and filter products achieving an operating profit of gbpm  gbpm operating loss sales of ultra wide band antennas to our lead customer were particularly strong in the first half of the year as we successfully completed the majority of the orders announced in fy executing these contracts has demonstrated our ability to introduce new products and rapidly ramp to volume production whilst controlling costs to ensure that we make a healthy margin for the business disappointingly the followon demand for this product variant has been lower than initially forecast by our customer however this business has enabled us to gain good momentum into the antenna market and has established us as a credible player in the sector as confirmed by the growing number of trials underway with other customers filter sales in fy exceeded our expectations as we saw strong demand from both our main telecommunications original equipment manufacturer oem customers and in the public safety communications market demand was spread over several filter variants which delivered improved margins as a result of excellent work by our operations and engineering teams on cost reduction initiatives new product development within filtronic wireless is focussed on antenna products and filters that go into these antennas where we see greater longterm potential due to the trend towards integrated antenna and filter products in the industry during the year we launched products that support the newly released frequency spectrums in the us mhz and europe mhz and we are currently working on antennas that provide additional high and low bands in different configurations progress in filtronic wireless is expected to remain lumpy due to the high level of customer concentration with just over  percent of sales revenue being derived from our largest customer over the past few years filtronic wireless has focussed on supplying western oems who service the mobile telecommunications infrastructure market following a series of consolidations in the industry in recent years there are now only a handful of oems available for us to service filtronic wireless has therefore looked to broaden its customer base by expanding its exposure to the public safety communications sector and to reengage with mobile network operators mnos where there is no direct competition with our oem sales to execute this strategy we have reorganised and strengthened our sales function in emea and the us to augment our direct sales channels we have appointed agents and distributors in certain territories to enable us to gain traction without the high overhead associated with a direct salesforce the process of reintroducing filtronic as a supplier to mnos will take time to yield significant contracts however we are making good progress and we are starting to see some initial small successes with some orders for filter products and growing engagement with our antenna product development roadmap including the supply of sample antennas to mnos for evaluation we anticipate this area of activity will grow over the coming months filtronic broadband filtronic broadband is a specialist designer and manufacturer of high frequency transceivers subsystems and components for the mobile telecommunications backhaul defence  aerospace and other adjacent markets sales revenue in our filtronic broadband business was approximately gbpm for the year  gbpm giving year on year sales growth of  percent during the year the business reduced its operating loss to gbpm  gbpm operating loss whilst this financial performance is clearly unsatisfactory substantial progress has been made to diversify our customer base and the markets that we serve we saw good growth in demand for filtronic broadbands flagship eband transceiver product orpheus in the first half of fy however it became apparent that our lead customer has struggled to compete with its asian competitors and has sought price reductions from us that would have resulted in unacceptable margins we have therefore declined to meet the target prices set by this customer and have focussed our resources on gaining business from customers who value our products more highly consequently we saw a fall in demand from this customer in the second half of the year and we do not anticipate further significant volumes from them over the next year the prospects for orpheus remain positive where customers understand the true value of our offering recent developments in our technology have seen orpheus reliably operating at gb per second the superior specification and demonstrable value proposition that we offer has resulted in growing demand from several tier  clients and we are also pleased that orpheus has been selected by another tier  oem for their new backhaul eband radio we are further encouraged to note that we have been commissioned to develop a derivative of orpheus for a high speed wireless internet network in the us this client is planning to use eband as a lower cost and faster to install alternative to fibre optic cable and represents a clear sign that broadband networks of the future will include wireless technology filtronic broadband has also seen an increase in demand for legacy multichip package mcp assemblies at ghz and a new customer recently commissioned us to assemble ghz mcps for a g trial system during the year we completed the key milestones in the development of a long range km subsystem eband link that utilised orpheus transceivers and our recently developed cerus power amplifiers these subsystems are currently undergoing flight trials by our customer pending their decision to proceed with commercialisation of this technology our ability to develop complex eband subsystems capable of achieving long range high capacity data links opens up significant market opportunities in a number of adjacent sectors including satellite and battlefield communications where traditional frequency bands are capacity constrained entering the defence  aerospace market has been a key objective for filtronic broadband for several years and following a number of prototype builds we were pleased to announce that we were selected as a manufacturing partner for a tier  european defence equipment supplier to manufacture their advanced radar transmit receive modules the working capital for this initial programme is financed by our customer as they buy all material and they supply that material to us on a free issue basis for manufacture and test the demand for high frequency transceivers subsystems and components is set to grow rapidly in the coming years and the business is ideally placed to benefit from this growth we have further strengthened our sales team and attended several trade shows that have led to exciting new customer engagements that include major silicon valley technology companies who are seeing the value of our mmwave technology capabilities future trends in the telecommunications infrastructure sector we see several trends that are defining the market and directly impact on product and technology development the market data as set out in the market overview section of the annual report and accounts continues to indicate that future infrastructure expenditure will be driven by the need to increase capacity the development of g networks is a hot topic in trade and general press publications and considerable investment is being made by mnos and oems in preparation for g g promises a significant rise in capacity as data rates to devices are predicted to increase from their current mb per second to gbper second currently the applications that require these data rates have not been defined but industry speculation suggests driverless cars and other iot requirements will be sufficiently data hungry to require this capacity pre g gpp have now named g as gnr g new radio with a full specification expected to be announced in september  release  leading up to the release of these specifications and in order to excite the market both the oems and mnos are starting to beat the drum about g we are seeing a number of operators increasing their glte capacity and branding these updates variously as pre g and g evolution in addition there are a number of trials being undertaken of various enabling technologies that will be used in g although specifications have not yet been released there is an emerging consensus on the frequencies that will be required for the higher data rates that g envisages and oems are working on developing products and technologies accordingly true g to date the precommercialisation trials that have been announced are mostly being conducted at ghz and are based on pointtopoint broadband delivery systems only nonmobileno handsets it is our expectation that true g networks will not start to appear until  once the considerable technical challenges have been overcome and finance for the significant infrastructure investment that g will require is available we expect major metropolitan areas to see the first deployments the opportunities for filtronic wireless will commence in the pre g phase where customers are looking to combine traditional spectrum with sub ghz to achieve license assisted access backhaul capacity will continue to be stretched during this period and this is likely to lead to increased demand for eband backhaul that will benefit filtronic broadband true g will see an integration of radio antenna and backhaul as base stations become network access points as the specifications and technologies required for g are developed with our deep knowledge of high frequency subsystems integrated antennas and transceivers filtronic is well placed to play a part in this major market development rob smith chief executive officer  july  financial review revenues sales revenue for the filtronic group increased in the year by  percent to gbpm  gbpm filtronic wireless was the main driver of the growth with sales of gbpm  gbpm as the business successfully fulfilled orders of ultra wide band antennas to its lead customer and the filter product offering saw much stronger trading to oem customers in both the mobile telecommunications infrastructure and the public safety communications markets filtronic broadband saw revenue growth of  percent with sales increasing to gbpm  gbpm whilst this growth was modest it was very encouraging to see a large proportion of revenues coming from new products as the business continues to make significant progress in diversifying the customer base and the markets it serves operating costs operating costs reduced in the year as the group benefitted from cost reductions implemented in fy further to this we took the opportunity in the period under review to consolidate our operational footprint in the us down to a single site in salisbury maryland which has resulted in reduced property costs and associated overheads we continue to invest in product development engineering and customer support to grow our business whilst ensuring that we have an efficient operating structure in line with the size and nature of our business overheads excluding depreciation amortisation and share based payments reduced to gbpm  gbpm the average headcount during the year was    although a recent investment has been made to increase the size of the engineering and product development organisation to facilitate further organic growth adjusted operating profitloss adjusted operating profitloss the definition of which is referenced on the income statement was gbpm  gbpm loss filtronic wireless returned to profitability with an adjusted operating profit of gbpm  gbpm loss due to significantly higher revenues improved product margins and a r educed overhead cost base filtronic broadband posted an adjusted operating loss of gbpm  gbpm which whilst unsatisfactory represents a significant improvement on the prior year operating profitloss operating profit was gbpm  gbpm loss in the year the difference between adjusted operating profit and operating profit in the year being a charge for amortisation of development costs in the year of gbpm  gbpnil exceptional costs exceptional finance income of gbpm  gbpnil was credited to the income statement due to the revaluation of a us dollar denominated intercompany balance in the filtronic wireless uk entity this was a result of the us dollar strengthening against sterling during the year and the intercompany loan to the us subsidiary being worth more in sterling capital expenditure capital expenditure of gbpm  gbpm included gbpm for the filtronic wireless business  gbpm and gbpm for filtronic broadband  gbpm filtronic wireless invested in production tooling to enable cost savings to improve product margins whilst filtronic broadband invested in new test equipment to increase production capacity on the recently secured contract to supply a tier  european defence oem over the next eight years research and development costs total research and development costs in the year were gbpm  gbpm the group continues to invest in research and development for the future growth of the business through new and enhanced products to meet the expanding demands of customer programmes key areas of expenditure included the development of a wider portfolio of antennas and eband products both of which we expect to deliver significant future revenue opportunities the group capitalises its research and development costs in line with ias  no costs met the criteria for capitalisation in the current financial year  gbpm amortisation of intangible assets in the year relating to development costs previously capitalised was gbpm  gbpnil giving an underlying research and development charge to the income statement of gbpm  gbpm inventory provision inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value it is the groups policy to regularly review the carrying value of its inventories and to make a provision for excess and obsolete inventory as at  may  the inventory provision was gbpm  gbpm warranty provision in line with industry practice the group provides warranties to customers over the quality and performance of the products it sells the groups policy is to make a provision calculated as a percentage of sales revenue after reviewing costs associated with faulty products returned as at  may  the warranty provision was gbpm  gbpm the increase in provision at the yearend reflected the higher sales attained during fy funding and cash flow the group ended the year with net cash of gbpm  gbpm net debt cash generation from operating activities in the year included receipts from research and development tax credits of gbpm of which gbpm related to development activities in fy and gbpm to activities in fy the gbpm relating to fy was recognised in the income statement last year and a was a debtor on the balance sheet at  may  cash

barclays bank plc in the uk which was increased from gbpm during the year as at  may  gbpnil was drawn down against this facility  gbpm following the increase of the barclays facility and as a consequence of the groups improved balance sheet the board took the decision to terminate the fgi us debtor book facility as the terms of this facility no longer met the groups requirements we
