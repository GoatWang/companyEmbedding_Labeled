에이스테크놀로지  homeproducts rf product ace technologies corp provides total solution from component module such like tma to rrh system in mobile network based on  years technology knowhow active antenna system technology integrates several radio frequency rf components power amplifiers and transceivers with the antenna dipoles this enables the phase and amplitude of the signals from each dipole inside the antenna to be electronically controlled benefits include more flexible deployment improved capacity and coverage smaller installation and lower power consumption while also supporting a multitechnology network active antenna systems will boost existing base station site efficiency and performance the technology can even be used to create micro and macro cells simultaneously by using the same hardware located at the macro base station active antenna system technology is set to bring new levels of flexibility to the base station and create a customer experience matched to the needs of every individual various product types single filter diplexer duplexer and multiband filter per mobile telecommunication bandwidth umts gsm   etc can be realized to air cavity dielectric resonator and waveguide type we promise to supply the most suitable product based on product reliability provided to major oems during  years per various bandwidth dcs gsm upcs umts wibro and wifi we suggest the most optimum specification such as low cost light weight and provide the simulation considering customer’s requirements per bandwidth size connector type electrical specification mount spec outdoor application  mhz  ghz band design provides  low insertion loss high power handing high isolation low imd specificity  optimal hign “q” value design  out door application  light weight low cost the product which is necessary component for base station composition per frequency and product is possessed most of product is applied to low cost through die casting and can be supplied through mass product experience also optimized system for customized product is obsessed the product delay filter biast rf switchhigh power various delay filter product lineup to control group delay of amp feedforwarder type is possessed for gsm gsm upcs wcdma and wibro light weight and high power knowhow is possessed based on supplying experiences to worldwide amp companies most of delay filters are specified per customer demand however based on development experiences per frequency we promise to provide low cost and high speed delivery biast are segregated and composed with rf signal  dc supply  aisg modem signal in one feed cable existing between base station and ald besides lightning surge protection function is equipped vswr monitoring function and aisg modemook or fsk modem equipped products also possessed rf switch is mechanical device for the purpose of  ohm transmission line switching based on base station system’s necessity the first function is bypass relay to detour main path the second takes a role of switching combiner to combine amplified output signal when necessary the third is redundancy switch to back up power amplifier the frequency bandwidth of bypass relay and redundancy switch is dcghz and the frequency bandwidth of switching combiner satisfy pcs and cellular’s bandwidth           에이스테크놀로지  homeproducts commodity product various commodity products were
