lightron fiberoptic devices inc gbps hsfp with wavelength stackup technology lightron fiberoptic devices inc gbps hsfp with wavelength stackup technology march   author lightwave staff the gbps hsfp product line provides eight wavelengths within one nm cwdm spectrum short cwdm wavelengths beyond the dispersion penalty are available in gbps cpriobsai and ethernet as well hsfp highdensity sfp is an advanced cwdm bidirectional pluggable optics approach that enables users to experience a x or x increase in fiber line operation efficiencies thanks to its wavelength stackup technology lightron says its wavelength stackup technology provides two six or maximum eight adjacent wavelengths within a  nm tolerance in conjunction with its thermoelectrical cooling design from the companys cooled bosa bidirectional optical subassembly the technology enables cwdm links with   or more wavelengths operating over the industrial temperature range and its design reduces the effects of rayleigh backscattering and back reflection use of the technology also does not require the introduction of new passive modules into the network the company adds hsfp transceivers have already been deployed to support lte roll outs in korea enhanced versions that will support greater reach will widen the application space within wireless applications and  gigabit ethernet networks judges comment just making a wdm sfp is not innovative but this sfp solves an industry problem and has lots of innnovation such as bidi that works multiple channels squeezed into existing bands and compatibility with already
