earth station at the satellite communication facility in raisting bavaria germany visualization from the opte project of the various routes through a portion of the internet telecommunication is the transmission of signs signals messages words writings images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire radio optical or other electromagnetic systems telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology it is transmitted either electrically over physical media such as cables or via electromagnetic radiation such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing the term is often used in its plural form telecommunications because it involves many different technologiescitation needed early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals such as beacons smoke signals semaphore telegraphs signal flags and optical heliographs other examples of premodern longdistance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats lungblown horns and loud whistles th and st century technologies for longdistance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies such as telegraph telephone and teleprinter networks radio microwave transmission fiber optics and communications satellites a revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by guglielmo marconi who won the nobel prize in physics in  other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications include charles wheatstone and samuel morse inventors of the telegraph alexander graham bell inventor of the telephone edwin armstrong and lee de forest inventors of radio as well as vladimir k zworykin john logie baird and philo farnsworth some of the inventors of television contents  etymology

compound of the greek prefix tele τηλε meaning distant far off or afar and the latin communicare meaning to share its modern use is adapted from the french because its written use was recorded in  by the french engineer and novelist édouard estaunié communication was first used as an english word in the late th century it comes from old french comunicacion c modern french communication from latin communicationem nominative communicatio noun of action from past participle stem of communicare to share divide out communicate impart inform join unite participate in literally to make common from communis historyedit for more details on this topic see history of telecommunication beacons and pigeonsedit a replica of one of chappes semaphore towers homing pigeons have occasionally been used throughout history by different cultures pigeon post had persian roots and was later used by the romans to aid their military frontinus said that julius caesar used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of gaul the greeks also conveyed the names of the victors at the olympic games to various cities using homing pigeons in the early th century the dutch government used the system in java and sumatra and in  paul julius reuter started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between aachen and brussels a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed in the middle ages chains of beacons were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information so the meaning of the message such as the enemy has been sighted had to be agreed upon in advance one notable instance of their use was during the spanish armada when a beacon chain relayed a signal from plymouth to london in  claude chappe a french engineer built the first fixed visual telegraphy system or semaphore line between lille and paris however semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres six to nineteen miles as a result of competition from the electrical telegraph the last commercial line was abandoned in  telegraph and telephoneedit sir charles wheatstone and sir william fothergill cooke invented the electric telegraph in  also the first commercial electrical telegraph is purported to have been constructed by wheatstone and cooke and opened on  april citation needed both inventors viewed their device as an improvement to the existing electromagnetic telegraph not as a new device samuel morse independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on  september  his code was an important advance over wheatstones signaling method the first transatlantic telegraph cable was successfully completed on  july  allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time the conventional telephone was invented independently by alexander bell and elisha gray in  antonio meucci invented the first device that allowed the electrical transmission of voice over a line in  however meuccis device was of little practical value because it relied upon the electrophonic effect and thus required users to place the receiver in their mouth to hear what was being said the first commercial telephone services were setup in  and  on both sides of the atlantic in the cities of new haven and london radio and televisionedit in  james lindsay gave a classroom demonstration of wireless telegraphy to his students by  he was able to demonstrate a transmission across the firth of tay from dundee scotland to woodhaven a distance of two miles  km using water as the transmission medium in december  guglielmo marconi established wireless communication between st johns newfoundland canada and poldhu cornwall england earning him the  nobel prize in physics which he shared with karl braun however smallscale radio communication had already been demonstrated in  by nikola tesla in a presentation to the national electric light association on  march  john logie baird was able to demonstrate the transmission of moving pictures at the london department store selfridges bairds device relied upon the nipkow disk and thus became known as the mechanical television it formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the british broadcasting corporation beginning  september  however for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by karl braun the first version of such a television to show promise was produced by philo farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on  september  computers and the internetedit on  september  george stibitz transmitted problems for his complex number calculator in new york using a teletype and received the computed results back at dartmouth college in new hampshire this configuration of a centralized computer mainframe with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the s however already in the s researchers started to investigate packet switching a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe a fournode network emerged on  december  constituting the beginnings of the arpanet which by  had grown to  nodes arpanet eventually merged with other networks to form the internet while internet development was a focus of the internet engineering task force ietf who published a series of request for comment documents other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories such as the local area network lan developments of ethernet  and the token ring protocol  key conceptsedit modern telecommunication is founded on a series of key concepts that experienced progressive development and refinement in a period of well over a century basic elementsedit telecommunication technologies may primarily be divided into wired and wireless methods overall though a basic telecommunication system consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another a transmitter that takes information and converts it to a signal a transmission medium also called the physical channel that carries the signal an example of this is the free space channel a receiver that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back into usable information for the recipient for example in a radio broadcasting station the stations large power amplifier is the transmitter and the broadcasting antenna is the interface between the power amplifier and the free space channel the free space channel is the transmission medium and the receivers antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver next the radio receiver is the destination of the radio signal and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to sometimes telecommunication systems are duplex twoway systems with a single box of electronics working as both the transmitter and a receiver or a transceiver for example a cellular telephone is a transceiver the transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other this can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in watts or kilowatts but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the microwatts or nanowatts hence transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their highpower circuitry and their lowpower circuitry from each other as to not cause interference telecommunication over fixed lines is called pointtopoint communication because it is between one transmitter and one receiver telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous lowpower but sensitive radio receivers telecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems the sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver analog versus digital communicationsedit communications signals can be sent either by analog signals or digital signals there are analog communication systems and digital communication systems for an analog signal the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information in a digital signal the information is encoded as a set of discrete values for example a set of ones and zeros during the propagation and reception the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise the output of a transmitter is noisefree for all practical purposes commonly the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way this form of noise is called additive noise with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here on the other hand unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold the information contained in digital signals will remain intact their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals telecommunication networksedit a telecommunications network is a collection of transmitters receivers and communications channels that send messages to one another some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user an analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users for both types of network repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances this is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise another advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory ie two voltage states high and low are easier to store than a continuous range of states communication channelsedit the term channel has two different meanings in one meaning a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver examples of this include the atmosphere for sound communications glass optical fibers for some kinds of optical communications coaxial cables for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them and free space for communications using visible light infrared waves ultraviolet light and radio waves this last channel is called the free space channel the sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two radio waves travel through a perfect vacuum just as easily as they travel through air fog clouds or any other kind of gas the other meaning of the term channel in telecommunications is seen in the phrase communications channel which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously for example one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of  mhz megahertz while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of  mhz each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about  khz kilohertz centered at frequencies such as the above which are called the carrier frequencies each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by  khz and the difference between  khz and  khz  khz is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system in the example above the free space channel has been divided into communications channels according to frequencies and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves this system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called frequencydivision multiplexing another term for the same concept is wavelengthdivision multiplexing which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time a time slot for example  milliseconds out of each second and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot this method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called timedivision multiplexing tdm and is used in optical fiber communication some radio communication systems use tdm within an allocated fdm channel hence these systems use a hybrid of tdm and fdm modulationedit the shaping of a signal to convey information is known as modulation modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform this is commonly called keying – a term derived from the older use of morse code in telecommunications – and several keying techniques exist these include phaseshift keying frequencyshift keying and amplitudeshift keying the bluetooth system for example uses phaseshift keying to exchange information between various devices in addition there are combinations of phaseshift keying and amplitudeshift keying which is called in the jargon of the field quadrature amplitude modulation qam that are used in highcapacity digital radio communication systems modulation can also be used to transmit the information of lowfrequency analog signals at higher frequencies this is helpful because lowfrequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space hence the information from a lowfrequency analog signal must be impressed into a higherfrequency signal known as the carrier wave before transmission there are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this two of the most basic being amplitude modulation am and frequency modulation fm an example of this process is a disc jockeys voice being impressed into a  mhz carrier wave using frequency modulation the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel  fm in addition modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing fdm societyedit telecommunication has a significant social cultural and economic impact on modern society in  estimates placed the telecommunication industrys revenue at  trillion or just under  percent of the gross world product official exchange rate several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society economic impactedit microeconomicsedit on the microeconomic scale companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires this is selfevident in the case of online retailer amazoncom but according to academic edward lenert even the conventional retailer walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors in cities throughout the world home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage in bangladeshs narshingdi district isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods in côte divoire coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price macroeconomicsedit on the macroeconomic scale larshendrik röller and leonard waverman suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth few dispute the existence of a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal because of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this is known as the digital divide a  survey by the international telecommunication union itu revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every  people and onethird of countries have fewer than one landline telephone subscription for every  people in terms of internet access roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of  people with internet access from this information as well as educational data the itu was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies using this measure sweden denmark and iceland received the highest ranking while the african countries nigeria burkina faso and mali received the lowest social impactedit telecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships nevertheless devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device such as the ability to conduct business or order home services as opposed to the social dimensions it was not until the late s and s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements new promotions started appealing to consumers emotions stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends since then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important in recent years the popularity of social networking sites has increased dramatically these sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs events and profiles for others to see the profiles can list a persons age interests sexual preference and relationship status in this way these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to courtship prior to social networking sites technologies like short message service sms and the telephone also had a significant impact on social interactions in  market research group ipsos mori reported that  of  to yearold sms users in the united kingdom had used the service to coordinate social arrangements and  to flirt other impactsedit news source preference of americans in  local tv  national tv  radio  local paper  internet  national paper  survey

conforms to the international telecommunication regulations established by the international telecommunication union itu which is the leading un agency for information and communication technology issues in  at the atlantic city conference the itu decided to afford international protection to all frequencies registered in a new international frequency list and used in conformity with the radio regulation according to the itus radio regulations adopted in atlantic city all frequencies referenced in the international frequency registration board examined by the board and registered on the international frequency list shall have the right to international protection from harmful interference from a global perspective there have been political debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting the history of broadcasting discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting the onset of world war ii brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda countries their governments insurgents terrorists and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mids in  the bbc broadcast propaganda to the arab world to partly counter similar broadcasts from italy which also had colonial interests in north africa modern insurgents such as those in the latest iraq war often use intimidating telephone calls smss and the distribution of sophisticated videos of an attack on coalition troops within hours of the operation the sunni insurgents even have their own television station alzawraa which while banned by the iraqi government still broadcasts from erbil iraqi kurdistan even as coalition pressure has forced it to switch satellite hosts several times on  november  president obama recommended the federal communications commission reclassify broadband internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality modern mediaedit worldwide equipment salesedit according to data

na na       telephoneedit optical fiber provides cheaper bandwidth for long distance communication in a telephone network the caller is connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges the switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number once the connection is made the callers voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the callers handset this electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that persons handset the landline telephones in most residential homes are analog—that is the speakers voice directly determines the signals voltagecitation needed although shortdistance calls may be handled from endtoend as analog signals increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission the advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel sidebyside with data from the internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise mobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixedline subscriptions in many markets sales of mobile phones in  totalled  million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of asiapacific  m western europe  m cemea central europe the middle east and africa  m north america  m and latin america  m in terms of new subscriptions over the five years from  africa has outpaced other markets with  growth increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as gsm or wcdma with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as amps there have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes starting with the operation of tat in  the s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers the benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity tat itself was able to carry  times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and todays optic fibre cables are able to carry  times as many telephone calls as tat this increase in data capacity is due to several factors first optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies second they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable lastly improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre assisting communication across many modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as asynchronous transfer mode atm the atm protocol allows for the sidebyside data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph it is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway the traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection this is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate something that will ensure a callers voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely there are competitors to atm such as multiprotocol label switching mpls that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant atm in the future radio and televisionedit main articles radio television and broadcasting digital television standards and their adoption worldwide in a broadcast system the central highpowered broadcast tower transmits a highfrequency electromagnetic wave to numerous lowpowered receivers the highfrequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information the receiver is then tuned so as to pick up the highfrequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information the broadcast signal can be either analog signal is varied continuously with respect to the information or digital information is encoded as a set of discrete values the broadcast media industry is at a critical turning point in its development with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts this move is made possible by the production of cheaper faster and more capable integrated circuits the chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts for television this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures ghosting and other distortion these occur because of the nature of analog transmission which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output in a simplified example if a binary message  was transmitted with signal amplitudes     and received with signal amplitudes     it would still decode to the binary message  — a perfect reproduction of what was sent from this example a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission in digital television broadcasting there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide these are the atsc dvb and isdb standards the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map all three standards use mpeg for video compression atsc uses dolby digital ac for audio compression isdb uses advanced audio coding mpeg part  and dvb has no standard for audio compression but typically uses mpeg part  layer  the choice of modulation also varies between the schemes in digital audio broadcasting standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the digital audio broadcasting standard also known as the eureka  standard the exception is the united states which has chosen to adopt hd radio hd radio unlike eureka  is based upon a transmission method known as inband onchannel transmission that allows digital information to piggyback on normal am or fm analog transmissions however despite the pending switch to digital analog television remains being transmitted in most countries an exception is the united states that ended analog television transmission by all but the very lowpower tv stations on  june  after twice delaying the switchover deadlinekenya also ended analog television transmission in december  after multiple delays for analog television there are three standards in use for broadcasting color tv see a map on adoption here these are known as pal german designed ntsc north american designed and secam french designed it is important to understand that these are the ways of sending color tv and they do not have anything to do with the standards for black  white tv which also vary from country to country for analog radio the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers the choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude am or frequency modulation fm to achieve stereo playback an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo fm internetedit the osi reference model the internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the internet protocol any computer on the internet has a unique ip address that can be used by other computers to route information to it hence any computer on the internet can send a message to any other computer using its ip address these messages carry with them the originating computers ip address allowing for twoway communication the internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers it is estimated that the  of the information flowing through twoway telecommunications networks in the year  were flowing through the internet most of the rest  through the landline telephone by the year  the internet clearly dominated and captured  of all the information in telecommunication networks most of the rest  through mobile phones as of update an estimated  of the world population has access to the internet with the highest access rates measured as a percentage of the population in north america  oceaniaaustralia  and europe  in terms of broadband access iceland  south korea  and the netherlands  led the world the internet works in part because of protocols that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other the nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run moreorless independently of other protocols this allows lowerlevel protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higherlevel protocols operate a practical example of why this is important is because it allows an internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the internet through an ethernet or wifi connection protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the osi reference model pictured on the right which emerged in  as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite for the internet the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe this is because the internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used this leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation in practice most intercontinental communication will use the asynchronous transfer mode atm protocol or a modern equivalent on top of optic fiber this is because for most intercontinental communication the internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network at the network layer things become standardized with the internet protocol ip being adopted for logical addressing for the world wide web these ip addresses are derived from the human readable form using the domain name system eg  is derived from wwwgooglecom at the moment the most widely used version of the internet protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent at the transport layer most communication adopts either the transmission control protocol tcp or the user datagram protocol udp tcp is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas udp is used when it is merely desirable with tcp packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers with udp packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost both tcp and udp packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by because certain applicationlevel protocols use certain ports network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements examples are to restrict internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority above the transport layer there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers most notably the secure sockets layer ssl and transport layer security tls protocols these protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential finally at the application layer are many of the protocols internet users would be familiar with such as http web browsing pop email ftp file transfer irc internet chat bittorrent file sharing and xmpp instant messaging voice over internet protocol voip allows data packets to be used for synchronous voice communications the data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the realtime synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed ie file transfer or email or buffered in advance ie audio and video without detriment that prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the voip calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization ie a private corporate style network but the internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of voip calls over a private network and over the public internet local area networks and wide area networksedit despite the growth of the internet the characteristics of local area networks lanscomputer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct this is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more costeffective and efficient without them when they are not connected with the internet they also have the advantages of privacy and security however purposefully lacking a direct connection to the internet does not provide assured protection from hackers military forces or economic powers these threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the lan wide area networks wans are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers once again some of their advantages include privacy and security prime users of private lans and wans include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret in the mids several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the datalink layer and the application layer of the osi reference model these included appletalk ipx and netbios with the dominant protocol set during the early s being ipx due to its popularity with msdos users tcpip existed at this point but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities as the internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks the tcpip protocols replaced existing local area network technologies additional technologies such as dhcp allowed tcpipbased computers to selfconfigure in the network such functions also existed in the appletalk ipx netbios protocol sets whereas asynchronous transfer mode atm or multiprotocol label switching mpls are typical datalink protocols for larger networks such as wans ethernet and token ring are typical datalink protocols for lans these protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler eg they omit features such as quality of service guarantees and offer collision prevention both of these differences allow for more economical systems despite the modest popularity of ibm token ring in the s and s virtually all lans now use either wired or wireless ethernet facilities at the physical layer most wired ethernet implementations use copper twistedpair cables including the common baset networks however some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations especially highspeed ones use optical fibers when optic fibers are used the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and singlemode fibers multimode fibers can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer longdistance performance transmission capacityedit the effective capacity to exchange information worldwide through twoway telecommunication networks grew from  petabytes of optimally compressed information in  to  petabytes in  to  optimally compressed exabytes in  and to  optimally compressed exabytes in  this is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages per person per day in  and six entire newspapers per person per day by  given this growth
