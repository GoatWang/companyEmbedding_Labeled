technology today announced and is demonstrating its first gallium nitride gan power ic product offering using taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporations tsmcs  volt ganonsilicon process technology   the da together with dialogs patented digital rapid chargetm powerconversion controllers will enable more efficient smaller and higher power density adapters compared to traditional silicon fieldeffect transistor fet based designs today dialog is initially targeting the fast charging smartphone and computing adapter segment with its gan solutions where it already enjoys more than  percent market share with its power conversion controllers   the exceptional performance of gan transistors allows customers to deliver more efficient and compact power adapter designs that meet todays market demands said mark tyndall svp corporate development and strategy dialog semiconductor following our success in bcdbased power management ics pmics as an early gan innovator dialog once again leads the commercialization of a new power technology into highvolume consumer applications   gan technology offers the worlds fastest transistors which are the core of highfrequency and ultraefficient power conversion dialogs da halfbridge integrates building blocks such as gate drives and level shifting circuits with v power switches to deliver an optimized solution that reduces power losses by up to  percent with up to  percent power efficiency the product allows for a seamless implementation of gan avoiding complex circuitry needed to drive discrete gan power switches   the new technology allows a reduction in the size of power electronics by up to  percent enabling a typical  watt adapter design today to fit into a  watt or smaller form factor this reduction in size will enable true universal chargers for mobile devices   as dialogs strategic foundry partner for power management ics for many years we are delighted to have expanded our relationship to collaborate

driver dialog semiconductor plc fwbdlg a provider of highly integrated power management acdc power conversion solid state lighting ssl and bluetoothr smart technology today debuted its innovative solid state lighting ssl led driver platform designed to deliver the ultimate in dimmer performance and compatibility with an ultralow bill of materials bom cost for nextgeneration led bulbs the first led driver from this new platform  the iw  delivers smooth flicker and shimmerfree dimming supporting the widest range of phasecut dimmers it also enables manufacturers to drive down the manufacturing cost of led bulbs by using dialogs patented integrated digital control technology to eliminate more than  components including the external bleeder circuit the iw singlestage led driver is designed for applications up to w including astyle br candle gu and par bulbs and t led tubes as well as external lighting ballast drivers it uses dialogs patented intelligent digital dimming control technology to provide exceptional compatibility and performance with the most challenging triac and digital dimmers while dialogs patented sophisticated digital algorithms enable integrated active biasing for high performance dimming at a lower cost compared to conventional external bleeder circuits dialog invented digital adaptive control led driver ics to optimise ssl luminaire performance and to drive the cost of led lighting down to an affordable price point for mass consumer adoption explains davin lee senior vice president and general manager of the power conversion business group at dialog semiconductor our innovative iw led driver platform once again raises the bar and extends our lead in wide dimmer compatibility exceptional dimming performance and ultralow bom cost  sophistication and performance that can only be achieved with digital control triac dimmers require a minimum load current to maintain forward conduction this is a problem for highly efficient lowpower led bulbs since they may fail to draw enough current through the triac to clear the holding current threshold resulting in flicker and shimmer in dimmable led bulbs many lowpower bulb designs address this issue by using an external bleeder circuit to draw extra current through the triac while it is conducting however the disadvantage is these bleeder circuits require additional external components and dissipate additional power inside the bulb significantly raising the internal temperature and shortening the led bulb operating lifetime the iw eliminates the cost of up to  external components in the bulb design including as many as  required for the external bleeder circuit and instead uses dialogs integrated digital algorithms that modulate primary fet switching to draw extra current during dimming this ensures the input current continuously stays above triac biasing thresholds during forward conduction eliminating the need for an external bleeder circuit the iw further reduces bom costs by simplifying the emi filter circuit and integrating the current sink switching and vcc charging circuits additional savings come from the iws advanced ic power management and voltage sensing which allow the use of lowcost offtheshelf inductors the iw integrates dialogs patented overtemperature protection otp derating technology to address led bulb lifetime issues caused by excessive heat otp technology monitors the temperature inside the sealed ssl bulb and seamlessly dims light output if the temperature rises above a safe operating threshold then restores brightness as temperature falls this results in cooler operation avoids exceeding the temperature rating of the electrolytic capacitors and helps ensure a predictable and safer bulb operating life iw key features  singlestage with up to w output power  digital algorithms provide exceptional dimmer compatibility  triac and digital  highest performance phasecut dimming  immune to noise and instability  no
