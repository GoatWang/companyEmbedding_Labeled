announced the launch of dreamwevr™ an extensive product line targeted at next generation ultrahd and k resolution virtual reality vr and augmented reality ar platforms the product line includes four new chips new vrspecific connectors and three new headmounted display hmd interconnect configurations to support highbandwidth lowlatency vr hmds and ar glasses when used together these products deliver a more realistic immersive comfortable and excitingvr experience for consumers the industry is currently at the dawn of vr and ar adoption and deployment in a market that according to digicapital is expected to grow to usd billion in  while todays vr experiences are immersive and impressive next generation systems promise to deliver significantly lighter weight higher cpugpu performance and dramatically higher bandwidth feeding next generation ultra high resolution multidisplay systems   advanced display and gesture chips these next generation systems require low latency interconnect technology that is dramatically faster yet thinner and lighter in order to meet industrial design and performance goals the performance improvement made by adopting k and k mobile display technology is stunning given it can be fed with ultra thin wearable interconnects spectra’s new products achieve these requirements across the multiple display and interconnect protocols shown below vr  hdmi  embedded cable processor  delivers hdmi bandwidth of up to gbps at k resolution vr  displayport hbr embedded cable processor  delivers displayport bandwidth of up to gbps at k resolution vr  displayport hbr embedded cable processor  delivers hdmi bandwidth of up to gbps at k resolution for stunning  million pixel cinema grade video and vr  usb  gen  embedded cable processor  delivers up to gbps of sensorcamera data for positional tracking and gesture recognition the company’s new display chips allow vr and ar oems to deliver content over ultrathin lowlatency cables at up to  higher bandwidth than first generation systems for greater vr immersion through higher resolution color depth and frame rates each of the four new chips feature spectra’s new spectralinear™ eq architecture that builds on previous advanced patented analog equalization technology developed by the company while incorporating a high linearity output driver that works in a highly collaborative way with device systemsonachip soc and enables the highest total link performance   vr  ar connector the company is also pleased to announce its new microchroma™ vrar connectors which are designed specifically for the vrar market existing generic connectors do not meet the precise needs of this new application space due to limited pin count limited power delivery and bulky size as many as four discreet connectors would be required to deliver what spectra’s microchroma™ connector provides in a single latching consumer connector for nextgeneration hmds measuring just mm high by mm wide the pin microchroma™ connector is ideally suited for thin light highperformance consumer vr interconnects it has an extensive feature set for high speed signal integrity low cost and high reliability   advanced interconnects spectra has shipped over  million active consumer cables to date the company is pleased to announce the immediate availability of three dreamwevr™ purposebuilt interconnects for vr and ar applications the vrdx vrdx and vrdx these new products are engineered specifically for vr and ar applications where high speed thinness low latency light weight and reliability are critical these products support hmd systems that connect to either standard or proprietary hosts such as game consoles mobile phones laptops or the new generation of pocketconsole™ graphic processing units gpu’s these dreamwevr™ interconnects transport either standard or proprietary signaling and power and may be tethered to or removable from the hmd configuration options include vrjunction™ vrcontrol™ and vrquickrelease™ for ease of use and enhanced functionality the race for the most immersive wearable experience is on  across both the vr and ar market segments  and display resolution weight and latency are the key differentiators said tony stelliga ceo of spectra our new dreamwevr™ products provide these burgeoning markets with what we believe to be bestinclass performance in these categories these new products deliver resolution and speed improvements of up to   across interconnect systems that are up to  thinner and lighter  made possible from the constant innovation and
