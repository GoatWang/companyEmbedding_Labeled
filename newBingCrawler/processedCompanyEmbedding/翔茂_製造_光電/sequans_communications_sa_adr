from those contained in the projections or forwardlooking statements some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements contained herein include without limitation i the contraction or lack of growth of markets in which we compete and in which our products are sold ii unexpected increases in our expenses including manufacturing expenses iii our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall iv delays or cancellations in spending by our customers v unexpected average selling price
