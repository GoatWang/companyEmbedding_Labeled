industry the company has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity subject to the availability of such opportunities economic conditions and other factors the

company will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to the company and its shareholders the activities of the company are subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the company has no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which will in all probability act without the consent vote or approval of the companys shareholders sources of opportunities it is anticipated that business opportunities may be available to the company from various sources including its officers and directors professional advisers securities broker dealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals the company will seek a potential business opportunity from all known sources but will rely principally on personal contacts of its officers and directors as well as

reorganizations if management deems it in the best interests of the company such firms may be retained in some instances the company may publish notices or advertisements seeking a potential business

opportunity or enter into a business in any industry and in any stage of development the company may enter into a business or opportunity involving a start up or new company the company may acquire a business opportunity in various stages of its operation in seeking a business venture the decision of management of the company will not be controlled by an attempt to take advantage of an anticipated or perceived appeal of a specific industry management group or product or industry but will be based upon the business objective of seeking longterm capital appreciation in the real value of the company in analyzing prospective business opportunities management will consider such matters as the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and other financial requirements  the history of operations if any prospects for the future the nature of present and expected competition the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of the management the potential for further research development or exploration the potential for growth and expansion the potential for profit the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products services trade or service marks name identification and other relevant factors generally the company will analyze all available factors in the circumstances and make a determination based upon a composite of available facts without reliance upon any single factor as controlling methods of participation of acquisition specific business opportunities will be reviewed and on the basis of that review the legal structure or method of participation deemed by management to be suitable will be selected such structures and methods may include but are not limited to leases purchase and sale agreements licenses joint ventures other contractual arrangements and may involve a reorganization merger or consolidation transaction the company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership corporation or other form of organization procedures as part of the companys investigation of business opportunities officers and directors may meet personally with management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business opportunity visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided check references of

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern however the company has incurred losses since its inception and has not yet been successful in establishing profitable operations further the company has current liabilities in excess of current assets and has no working capital to pay its expenses these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern in this regard management is proposing to raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations through loans or through sales of its common stock or through a possible business combination with another company there is no assurance that the company will be successful in raising this additional capital or achieving profitable operations the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties f gtm holdings inc    sp global ratings’ credit
