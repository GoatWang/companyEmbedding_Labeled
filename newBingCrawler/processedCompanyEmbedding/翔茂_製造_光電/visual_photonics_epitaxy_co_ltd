superior rf performance of gaas hbts gaas hbt has become the main stream technology for mobile handset pas and wlan gaas material has higher bandgap energy and higher breakdown voltage as compared to si material devices this makes gaas material more suitable than si for high voltage rf component application some applications include rf device testing equipment and base stations for wireless communication infrastructurebased on mocvd epitaxial growth core technology vpec has developed high voltage gaas hbt epitaxial wafers the basecollector breakdown voltage is over  volts and collectoremitter breakdown voltage is over  volts the rf and dc performance of high voltage gaas hbts are more suitable for applications in g handset base stations and other high voltage rf components than si because of the high quality high dc and rf performance reliability and consistency of vpec’s high voltage gaas hbt epitaxial wafers vpec’s high voltage gaas hbt epitaxial wafers has been
