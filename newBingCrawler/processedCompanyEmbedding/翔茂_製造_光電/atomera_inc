extend moores lawin cmos boosting performance sansscaling r colin johnson  am edt  comments no ratings saveslogin to rate tweet lake wales fla — moores law could be extended again sans scaling according to robert mears mears invented the erbium doped fiber amplifier edfa — the first commercial and still popular method of amplifying optical signals without having to convert them into electrical signals and back again now mears believes he has invented an equally industrychanging technology for cmos called the mears silicon technology mst at atomera inc los gatos calif originally nanovis llc at atomera our vision was how to structure silicon so it had electrical properties that would allow it to work with other types of materials it was created in computer simulations then realized on wafers mears told ee times our whole purpose at first was to boost electron and holemobility simultaneously but then we discovered all these other advantages that went along with it a crosssection image of the mears silicon technology mst where oxygen superlattice layers in the channel of a transistor red increase mobility and drive current while lowering leakage source atomera mst epitaxy inserts oxygen submonolayers between the transistor channels crystalline lattice layers as they grow see figure mears claims that the result not only enhances carrier mobility but also provided higher drive current and lower leakage current by as much as  the oxygen does not bond with the channel material making an insulating oxide but rather acts as a superlattice that invokes quantum confinement principles to enhance performance the performance improvements can also be tradedoff for smaller chip area at the same performance but lower cost as well as reduced supply voltage for a power reduction at the same performance the mst process is an epitaxial grown silicon step put down during silicon deposition using standard equipment mears told us during growth we stop at periodic interval and put down a monolayer of oxygen creating a very subtle disturbance in the silicon lattice for conditional confinement that squeezes that conduction region ending up reducing the scattering of electron and holes atomeras mst quantum confinement superlattice layers right compared to a normal cmos transistor left source atomera claimed performance enhancements mears team discovered also include improved reliability and reduced variability for higher yields and better transistor matching respectively due to a more ordered steeper retrograde wellchannel profile for better channel doping the amount of performance enhancement depends on many factors according to chief executive officer ceo president and board director scott bibaud but ranges between and percent the good news is that mst can be applied at any node — from legacy  nanometer nodes to mainstream  nanometer nodes to the most advanced to nanometer nodes for instance atomera published a paper on nextgeneration srams in the april  issue of the ieee transactions on electron devices titled analysis of nm bulksi finfet technologies for tsram scaling there they stated that using a mst punchthrough stop layer facilitates reductions in sram minimum operating voltages by  and area savings of  in the sram cell we make a technology that adds to the cmos process mobility enhancements plus many other side benefits including higher performance lower power consumption better yields and lower costs bibaud told ee times use our technology to increase performance by the same amount as going to the next design node — rather than continuing to shrink with mst we believe that  nanometer will be the most popular node for the next decade because only very large dies make it worth the move to  nanometer mears invented mst just after the turn of the st century and has been hard at work with his team at atomera ever since perfecting the technique and proving the concept for microprocessors drams srams flash other memory technologies powermanagement chips radiofrequency rf analog and mixed‐signal devices the companys business plan is to license its technology — which is protected by  us patents and over  international patents — to every major semiconductor maker after all all fab owners want more bangfortheirbuck and atomera promises to deliver it chief executive officer ceo president and board director scott bibaud is ringing the nasdaq opening bell on august   as the newly public company atomera inc atmr source nasdaq the company went going public at this time because they have three legacy node makers of analog and mixed signal chips which atomera anticipates will allow their names to be used as licensees by  also pushing atomera to go public on nasdaq as atmr there are three ways mst can solve moores law bibaud told us for legacy nodes for analog and power devices such as   and nanometer they can shrink their die size while getting the same performance at   and nanometer mst can give a new level of performance and lower power at the same node allowing fabs to be productive longer and at very advanced node like   and nanometers finfets using mst will allow fabs to continue using bulk silicon rather than going to other materials like iiiv channels atomera is keeping its hand closetoitsvest on its future growth opportunities — besides saying that it hopes to work its way up from legacy silicon nodes to popular and then advancednodes however it claims to have even higher goals in sight for instance mears photonicsamplifier fame has gotten his mental gears turning on how to enhance optical and solar devices with mst and according to bibaud the company also has improvements of magnetic materials for nextgeneration advanced memories in sight so far however the company is only revealing how standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos fabs can easily integrate mst into the conductive channel of their transistors one paradox however is that on the one hand it emphasizes how easy it is to merely modify a fabs epitaxial layer design on the other hand it claims their adopters will also need consulting services to to optimize the oxygen superlattice layer for particular applications one thing is for sure atomera needs that revenue stream to get it out of the red since mass production could be years away the company recently went public as atmr and now has to answer to stockholders accordingly it is hoping to cash in on licensing and consulting for the  billion semiconductor market prompting nasdaq to allow bibaud to ring the exchange opening bell on august   on the positive side atomera says their costperwafer is lower than alternative cmos enhancement techniques that extend the lifetime of a fabs infrastructure including stress memorization embeddedsige dual stress liner soi silicon on insulator and hkmg highk metal gate on the negative side atomera claims to have taken their technology to most big fabs but have only convinced three legacy fabs to signon and what is even more curious claims to have never briefed any analysts i could interview to get an unbiased evaluation of mst for more information read atomeras

semiconductor industry it developed mears silicon technology which increases performance and power efficiency in semiconductor transistors the company was founded by robert mears in april   and is headquartered in los gatos ca senior vice president    klatencor corp klatencor was formed in april  through the merger of kla instruments kla and tencor instruments tencor two longtime leaders in the semiconductor equipment industry prior to the merger both businesses served a segment of the inspection and metrology area with kla focused on defect inspection solutions and tencor placing its emphasis on metrology solutions merging together in a onetoone stock swap valued at  billion klatencor became the most important process control player in the industry bringing to market a complete line of yield management products and services from a single company kla was named after its founders ken levy and bob anderson the word “tencor” came about because the founder of tencor karel urbanek wanted a two syllable name that would be easy to remember kla instruments was first established in  with its first product emerging on the market in —an automated inspection system that reduced photomask inspection time from eight hours to  minutes shortly thereafter kla instruments went public and expanded its inspection product portfolio to include patterned wafer inspection systems two years later kla further broadened its offerings into the wafer metrology business through optical overlay and linewidth measurement systems during the subsequent few years the company expanded its product base through the development of software solutions to help integrate inspection and measurement data for analysis—ultimately forming the industry’s first yield management software services group to provide customers with expertise in yield enhancement through engineering consulting services  tencor instruments established its name and first introduced its yield management product—the alphastep stylus surface profiler—just seven months later this yield management solution provided significant improvement in stepheight measurement a critical parameter in measuring film layer thickness in  tencor instruments launched its first surfscan product—a particle and contamination defect system based on laser scanning technology which soon became the production standard by the late s tencor had broadened its yield management product offerings to also include defect review and data analysis tools following an initial public offering in  tencor then acquired prometrix a leading supplier of thinfilm measurement solutions and further expanded its yield management product offering at the time of its merger with kla tencor had revenues of approximately  million and  employees

estimated offering expenses of  the net proceeds of this offering will be approximately  we intend to apply the estimated net proceeds of the offering as follows amount percent development engineering     business development sales and marketing     research     working capital     total net proceeds     we intend to apply approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering towards development engineering which will consist primarily of our further development and qualification of mst® and the evaluation testing and engineering involved in the formal product qualification process undertaken by our potential customers as our marketing and business development efforts lead to a significant indication of interest on the part of a potential customer we will engage in development engineering for purposes of characterizing our solution to the goals and needs of the customer and work with customer to tune our mst® to their unique production process and equipment we intend to apply approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering towards business development marketing and sales in the initial stages of our marketing and business development we expect to spend a significant amount of time and capital in defining the benefits of mst® for each target customer including simulation modeling data collection marketing costs market research partnership development and business development efforts we intend to apply approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering towards research spending including longterm investigation into additional advanced materials and techniques for our platform efforts with our academic and scientific partners and maintenance of our patent portfolio the net proceeds allocated towards working capital will be applied towards our costs of facilities information technology public company related costs including accounting and legal along with normal recurring general and administrative expenses our estimated use of proceeds is based on our current assumptions and estimates concerning the costs and timelines of securing one or more idms or fabless semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license mst®technology and start fullscale industrial production of a device that incorporates our mst® technology if our assumptions or estimates prove to be inaccurate we may require additional funds in order to carry out the activities described above in addition the expected allocation of net proceeds set forth above represents our best estimates based upon our present plans and our assumptions regarding industry conditions and our anticipated future revenues and expenditures we may find it necessary to reallocate some of the proceeds within the abovedescribed categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes in order to carry out our business plan if those assumptions change if the underwriter exercises its right to purchase additional  shares of common stock to cover overallotments we may receive up to an additional  after deducting  for underwriting discounts we intend to apply any net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option to working capital pending the uses described above we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing securities such as money market accounts certificates of deposit commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the us government our lead product mst® is a proprietary and patent protected performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry we compete with idms oems foundries fabless manufacturers of semiconductors and semiconductor ip licensing companies for the development and commercialization of technologies that improve the performance of semiconductors historically when a new fabrication process proves to be a lowcost improvement to the standard fabrication process and is additive rather than in place of other performance technologies it has been successfully adopted industrywide good examples of such advances have been strained silicon such as sige we believe that mst® has the potential to be one of these lowcost additive technologies in which case mst® would not be subject to significant direct competition from other technologies company description we are engaged in the business of developing commercializing and licensing proprietary processes and technologies for the  billion semiconductor industry our lead technology named mears silicon technology™ or mst® is a thin film of reengineered silicon typically  to  angstroms or approximately  to  silicon atomic unit cells thick mst® can be applied as a transistor channel enhancement to cmostype transistors the most widely used transistor type in the semiconductor industry mst® is our proprietary and patentprotected performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry we believe that by incorporating mst® transistors can be smaller with increased speed reliability and energy efficiency in addition since mst® is an additive and low cost technology it can be deployed on an industrial scale with machines commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing we believe that mst® can be widely incorporated into the most common types of semiconductor products including analog logic optical and memory integrated circuits we do not intend to design or manufacture integrated circuits directly instead we intend to develop and license technologies and processes that will offer the designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits a lowcost solution to the industry need for greater performance and lower power consumption in the mids our founder dr robert mears was part of a team that reengineered silica optical fiber to invent the erbiumdoped fiber amplifier or edfa a technology that increased the bandwidth of optical fiber more than  times the invention of edfa helped to revolutionize the development of broadband and to this day remains a key technology in the optical communications industry dr mears anticipated scaling problems for silicon semiconductors and founded atomera incorporated in order to address those problems for the semiconductor industry over the last ten years we have undertaken significant laboratory testing and engaged with a range of semiconductor industry and academic technology leaders to evaluate mst® performance on test chips in industrial fabrication environments we believe this testing has demonstrated that mst®offers performance benefits beyond and in most cases additive to those provided by already successful semiconductor performance enhancement technologies such as dual stress liners and sourcedrain channel stressors such as esigeesic and can be implemented without significant additional cost or significant modification to the current semiconductor fabrication process we are now in the process of transitioning mst® technology toward commercial adoption we are currently in the early stages of process qualification with leading integrated device manufacturers or idms and foundries the idms and foundries are our intended customers and by way of the process qualification stage they test and evaluate the potential incorporation of our mst® technology into the integrated circuits they produce we are also partnering with manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication equipment and developers of modeling tools these parties are part of a semiconductor infrastructure supporting the industry with manufacturing capital equipment for transistor production and transistor process modeling software and we are in discussions with certain equipment manufacturers and tool developers concerning their incorporation of our mst® technology into the equipment and tools they offer to the industry assuming the timely and successful completion of process and subsequent product qualification by customers and partners we expect mst®enabled product revenue in   atomera incorporated was formed as a
