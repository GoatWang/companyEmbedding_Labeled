soaring timothy green tmfbargainbin jul   at pm what happened shares of semiconductor substrate manufacturer axt inc nasdaqaxti jumped on thursday following the release of the companys secondquarter report revenue was ahead of analyst expectations while earnings were inline which was enough to send the stock about  higher by  pm edt so what axt reported secondquarter revenue of  million up  year over year and about  million higher than the average analyst estimate axt ceo morris young pointed to record revenue from indium phosphide substrates as well as improvements in semiinsulating gallium arsenide semiconducting gallium arsenide and germanium substrates as the main drivers of growth image source getty images earnings came in at  per share up from  per share during the prioryear period and in line with analyst expectations higher revenue a basispoint improvement in gross profit and a drop in total operating expenses drove the bottomline increase substrate gross margin was higher than the companywide gross margin offset by a lower gross margin from raw materials now what young expects  to end up being a good year for the company as he stated in the release  is shaping up to be a solid year of growth for axt across our portfolio we are seeing emerging technologies and strengthening demand from established applications that are driving growth in each of our substrate product

catalysts make this  tech stock attractive  axt inc nasdaqaxti  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»axt inc a cash hoard share buybacks and other potential catalysts make this  tech stock attractivejan  about axt inc axti hawkinvest value growth at reasonable price contrarian growtheditors note this article covers a stock with less than a  million market cap please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks axt inc nasdaqaxti is a small tech company that appears to have been through some real highs and lows in the early s this stock was trading for over  the financial crisis took the stock down to about a buck in may  but it then surged to nearly  in january  as most investors know its not uncommon for tech stocks to go through these boom and bust cycles its also well known that it can really pay off big to buy at the lows if the company has the potential for another up cycle this company primarily designs and manufactures semiconductor substrates which are often used in wireless communication products fiber optics and led applications axt inc has annual revenues of about  million and the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels due to a large amount of cash plus there is always the potential for the company to reinvent its business model while it is hard to say if this stock is poised for a significant move higher any time soon there are some factors that make this stock worth considering or at least watching as the chart shows this stock has been in an uptrend in recent months it bottomed out at about  per share in october and then went up to about  in early  the recent market pullback seems to have put pressure on this stock however this could be an ideal buying opportunity as the light blue line on the chart shows this stock remains in an uptrend and it is now resting at the low end of the recent trading range in the past few months investors who have bought the stock when it traded near the blue uptrend line were rewarded and it has also paid to sell when it touched the high end of the recent trading range which is now around  per share as indicated by the purple trend line its never a sure thing but these patterns are certainly worth considering for a company with a market capitalization of about  million this one has a cash hoard it has just over  million in cash which is equivalent to around  per share and no debt on the balance sheet this is a considerable amount of cash for a stock trading at just over  per share it also appears undervalued based on book value which is around  per share when you factor in the cash and that it has no debt it shows that the enterprise value is right around  million this is another sign the company is undervalued especially when considering the annual revenues of nearly  million the cash hoard reduces downside risks for investors and gives the company flexibility to develop new products and invest in marketing one potential downside risk that needs to be considered is the fact that this company has recently posted losses for the third quarter of  it lost  million or about  cents per share the loss was partially due to a decline in gross margins from  in the second quarter to  in the third quarter this gross margin decline was due to a change in the product mix sold in that quarter however the potential downside risks from a small quarterly loss seem minimal for a stock trading at these levels especially since the company has plenty of cash clearly the company needs to increase sales or increase profit margins in order to return to a level of solid profitability another option would be to invest in new product lines and adapt to new market demands in order to create shareholder value in addition to its main line of business this company owns stakes in five joint ventures it is the majority owner in three of these ventures which gives it board level control in one company nanjing jin mei gallium co ltd which produces n n ga and b gallium it owns an  stake the stakes in these businesses may have more value than the current stock price indicates the  stake in the company that produces gallium seems most interesting since gallium can be used like liquid chocolate in d printers while this has not hit the mainstream yet it could be a potential future business opportunity d printing could revolutionize manufacturing and allow individuals to have a mini factory in their homes while most d printers use thermoplastics other materials like gallium allow printers to make metal products an article from extremetechcom explains the potential for gallium in d printing which states gallium is the chocolate of metals with a melting point of  degrees the stuff will literally melt in your hand and then solidify when you put it down this melting point can be lowered by alloying with indium to make a nontoxic substitute for mercury in applications like thermometers and tilt switches gallium has another trick up its sleeve in which it rapidly forms an oxide skin when exposed to air this property has recently been exploited by researchers at nc state to do something pretty incredibleprint stable d structures using room temperature liquid metal its far too early to know if gallium usage will grow and if this company will capitalize on d printing in the future but it sure seems to be an interesting point to consider as it could be a game changer as a high tech company axt inc could be positioned to benefit from this potential in the future if the market for gallium in d printing grows that is a big if but the fast growth in the emerging d printing industry is bound to create many opportunities that the market is not fully aware of now that potential makes this stock worth watching the cheap valuation a cash hoard and the recent pullback make it a stock to consider buying as a turnaround play management also seems to think the shares are trading at bargain levels and worth buying since it authorized a  million stock buy back just last year here are some key points for axt inccurrent share price the  week range is  to annual dividend na data is sourced from yahoo finance no guarantees or
