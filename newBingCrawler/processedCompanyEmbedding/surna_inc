touting srna from various stock promotersthe recent financials of the company appear to be very bleakshares of the company are held by third parties and are ready to be dumped into the marketwe have not contacted the company regarding the claims in the articlenote this article is about a nanocap stock also referred to as a penny stock while all investments are risky nanocap stocks are among the most risky among nanocap stocks the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns such as srna they are also among the most illiquid stocks usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment quite often it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position srna is no exception to that srna is a nanocap stock which is traded on the otc markets and priced well below the  mark the readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article introduction srna otcqbsrna is a publicly traded company which has experienced a sharp increase in trading activity during the last few days in this article we will outline the facts which are in our opinion related to the sudden increase in the volume of this usually thinly traded low volume stock the promotion during the last few days we have received several promotional emails from various stock promoters touting the stock obviously we do not consider the emails being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and trading activity to be a coincidence emails received on srna the reality zero revenue negative income bright future as often happens with aggressively promoted companies a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture it seems that surna inc is of no exception to that rule in our opinion it is clear that the price of srna has nothing in common with the stocks true value if we take a look at srnas income statement we would see that the companys revenue has remained exactly zero during the entire year of  while its net income has been negative during all of it moreover if we check the latest q form filed on  we would see that the company is actually classified as a going concern with all the attendant circumstances finally if we take a look at the q form filed on the th of november  we will see that during the second half of  the company has been issuing shares on a massive scale to different third parties amounting to a total of just over  million shares the stated reason is for the most part consulting services taking into consideration the ongoing promotion and concluding from the aforementioned facts we firmly believe that srnas current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at overinflated prices rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market but why you ask the reason why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised that is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock the answer for this hides of course in the small print let us have a look at the disclaimer found in the promotional emails touting srna which weve received and in simple plain english someone  may it be the promoter sending out the email message or a third party which had paid the promoter in cash for sending the message  is holding shares of srna and plans to get rid of them dump them in the open market therefore our conclusion is that the promotional emails sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices while the promoters or third party unload their shares upon them conclusion it is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article that we hold the opinion that srna shares are essentially worthless we believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock this practice is well known and is done exclusively for one reason only  so the insiders can unload dump their shares which they had previously acquired almost for free in the free market onto unsuspecting investors while taking advantage of the stocks inflated price in view of that we hold the opinion that any investor who had purchased shares of the company should consider liquidating his entire position immediately even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing our view we must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation  ivan illich for longs if you are long the stock we believe you should consider getting out immediately it is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stocks price is likely to be temporary as it will never repeat its previous highs we believe srna has a price target of around  which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks or months at most if you have already accrued losses on the stock it may be a good idea to sell now so as to avoid additional losses do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many we believe srnas stock price will drop  or more in the following weeks it may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now a man must be big enough to admit his mistakes smart enough to profit from them and strong enough to correct them  john c maxwell for shorts bearing the aforementioned facts in mind we believe sophisticated investors will quickly comprehend the idea that shorting srna may be a lucrative opportunity as we are convinced that the potential downside for srna is substantial if you are able to locate borrows we believe shorting srna may prove to be profitable as its price may prove to be highly inflated
