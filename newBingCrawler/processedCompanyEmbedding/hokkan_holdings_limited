younger people in particular already demanding conveniently packaged healthy products  dairy products such as drinkable yoghurts are already one area that has been positively impacted by the emerging trend with singleserve onthego rigid plastic formats performing particularly well currently  from our experience injapan we know that aseptic technology can achieve lightweight bottles a flexible bottle design and long product shelf life  aseptic technology offers us numerous opportunities for making quality products said masaaki ikezawa president of pthokkan indonesia   although the purchase of healthy beverages such as sour milk drinks and sports and energy drinks is not yet common practice amongst other indonesian consumers increasing awareness of health issues accompanied with rising disposable income is set to spark a change in habits  pthokkanindonesiaexpects naturally healthy and fortified products including speciality asian drinks bottled water powder concentrates fruit and vegetable juices functional drinks and rtd teas to grow significantly in sales over the coming years  packaging formats in the country tend to be singleserve now with most drinks packaged in pet bottles  demand for returnable glass bottles has declined substantially over the last couple of years mainly through one producer switching production from glass to oneway pet bottles the increasing use of pet is down to a number of factors  its  recyclability excellent barrier material properties that allow extended shelf life bottle design freedom and the greater brand recognition possibilities offered by the package transparency being resealable light and compact the pet bottles are also more convenient for the customer as they do not have to be consumed at one time and are far more suited to the dynamic urban lifestyles of younger indonesian consumers   an understanding supplier the philosophy driving pthokkan indonesiais the pursuit of the best possible quality for its customers  the transfer of the experience and knowledge of aseptic production gained by the group injapanwas seen as key in providing safe packaging technology and optimum product quality in the new plant in indonesia rather than gaining market share from existing suppliers to the indonesian market hokkan sees itself attempting to create a new aseptic market in which it strongly believes for the indonesian consumer with the experience of nihon canpack gained injapan the group felt comfortable that sidel fully understood its focus on product quality  cost of course was important although not its priority as the group was intent on quality and fast startup of the installation  being a copacker flexibility of the line  especially in the design and format of the bottles produced  was also an important consideration   the experience and expertise to respond to market demands the manufacturing plant which is located jus t kilometres to the south of central jakarta has ample supplies of fresh natural water drawn from three wells  it is also close to sukabumi city and benefits from an established distribution network in nearby jakarta  pthokkan indonesia made the decision to invest in a pet aseptic line including a wet aseptic combi sensofill fma the combi pet systems combine blow moulding filling and capping in a single integrated system they optimise layouts by eliminating conveying empty bottle handling accumulation and storage and therefore have a smaller footprint  they improve packaging hygiene ensuring food safety  a single enclosure making it easier to keep hygiene under control along with other hygiene options the flow meter sensofill™ fma filler can handle a broad variety of products  including both high and low acid products still beverages or products with pulps  in containers from  ml to l it manages all bottle finishes and accommodates both flat and sport caps the line was also equipped with sidels eit™  efficiency improvement tool  the automated data acquisition and information system which enables instantaneous remote connection to the plant floor in order to make it possible to monitor closely and analyse production data   the choice of the combi sensofill fma to blow fill and cap the drinks produced was partly influenced by the small compact footprint of the machinery as well as the energysaving possibilities reduced manpower and lightweighting benefits of the sidel equipment  pthokkanindonesiawas also pleased with the collaboration with the sidel team on the design and development of the new bottles  we let the professionals do the job of bottle design sidel studied market trends and came up with a good solution that met customer needs and matched the indonesian market culture said david chendra general manager of pthokkan indonesia  the customer alone could not have researched local market trends and the most practical designs to fulfil consumer demand due to time and cost implications  conversely sidel had the experience and expertise to respond quickly in handling the research and turning around the designs in a relatively short time the supplier did so successfully meeting the different cultural approaches and needs of the market to deliver a professional solution  the finished designs evaluated and tested well before production started   providing the right solutions the hokkan group sees sidel as the company leading innovation flexibility and production rates in pet bottling  in thefar east just as in the west there is growing concern about the costs  both financial and environmental  of raw materials and power consumption the group therefore looks to sidel to provide solutions in reducing the use of materials and energy in increasing savings extending the possibilities of lightweighting retaining quality and extending the shelflife of its sensitive products  in our view sidel is a company that leads the field of innovation bottle design flexibility and services  we will continue to work with them to find ways to further reduce energy consumption and they have presented a highly innovative solution for using biomaterial  at pthokkan indonesia we appreciate this partnership said ikezawa   new business opportunities based on this success following the success of the first aseptic line pthokkan is now evaluating investment in a second looking into the possibility of using a combi predis fma  this system is configured with predis sidels dry preform decontamination technology integrating all the preform decontamination blowing filling and capping functions into a single production enclosure predis enhances production flexibility by replacing wet bottle sterilisation with dry preform decontamination removing the need for rinsing water it helps to protect liquid packaging from microorganisms preserving sensitive drink integrity and lengthening shelf life this second aseptic line equipped with the proven dry preform decontamination solution from sidel would be designed to further extend the capacity that pthokkan indonesia has for producing sensitive beverage products   first move into foreign markets in  the hokkan group first joined up with nestlé with the intention of expanding their beverage commissioned business by forming nihon canpack malaysia limited to take advantage of the growing market insouth east asia  ten years later the group also entered the vietnamese market as a contracted filling company  its subsidiaries hokkai can company and nihon canpack limited both follow the established strategies of comprehensive contracting manufacturing and filling of pet bottles for the soft drinks market  the manufacturing capacity of the hokkai can company is also used in tandem with product development capabilities of nihon canpack to undertake contracted manufacturing of food and beverage products for local producers  as well as those in europe th eunited states and japan   partnering with toyota
