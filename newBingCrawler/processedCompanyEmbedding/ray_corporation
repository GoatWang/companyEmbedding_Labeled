stability and high rigidity gantry structure and high safety based on european standards bfxinline d axi for semiconductor power module inspection enable broaden range of inspection from semiconductor to igbt power module adopted  kv and kv micro focus xray open tubes bfx can inspect and detect various objects such as flip chip soldering void in tsv and lth in semiconductor field and also igbt power module soldering in power device field saki corporation has successfully developed planar ct technology which can accurately reconstruct d shape based on transmission images scanned from various angles by using micro focus xray open tube and high definition flat panel in combination scanning is performed at accurate position by high rigidity gantry to create pct reconstructed images of very high definition when nanofocus high definition kv type xray source and high definition flat panel are used in combination fine structure inside semiconductor can be analyzed also when high power kv

bfxinline d axi for pcb inspection inline machine optimized for pcb assembly line which combines micro focus closed type xray source and high definition flat panel detector bga ball’s head in pillow defects which are said to be one of the most difficult inspection items can be detected automatically without fail bfx can perfectly separate top and bottom side of printed circuit board bfx can also measure solder joint structure of assembled qfns and bgas as well as lamination state of pops with high definition in d bfx automatically corrects pcb warpage and position misalignment and creates d data for entire sample by connecting partially reconstructed d data by doing so it supports inspection data generation for microchips large ics and connectors without requiring a user to intentionally execute a special operation for fov size various necessary functions such as stabilization method of xray intensity and automatic calibration method are properly equipped with the machines to assure
