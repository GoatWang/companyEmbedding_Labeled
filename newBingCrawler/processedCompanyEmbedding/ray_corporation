print reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia published rd march  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers marketing mix is a general phrase used to describe the different kinds of choices organizations have to make in the whole process of bringing a product or service to market the  ps is one way  probably the bestknown way  of defining the marketing mix and was first expressed in  by e j mccarthy what is marketing putting the right product in the right place at the right price at the right time when we talk about marketwhether you are a small business or a large corporation you need a good marketing strategy there are many ways to market your business the question is which ways are the most effective for your product or service rayban is a eyewear companythis company just make sunglasses the  ps of rayban marketing decisions generally fall into the following four controllable categories product price place distribution promotion product productservice the term product refers to tangible physical products as well as services here are some examples of the product decisions to be made brand name functionality styling quality safety packaging repairs and support warranty accessories and services rayban have a eyewear productsrayban become a good brand in eyewear industry rayban know what does the customer want from the product and what needs does it satisfy rayban just selling googols but in many models rayban giving guaranty on some googols glasses for screech rayban produces a product which is stylish and different from others eyewear companies like fastrackrayban also selling its classics googols because rayban know that customer like classical model to wear at present time where the fashion change day by day but rayban producing their old models and selling rayban selling their product at high price because company giving some features like u v protection and rayban sunglasses never give bad effect on eye side so these type of products features helps to meet customers wants and needswhat these type of features may be customer dont want or actually use for example if we talk about rayban glasses the most of customer when they wearing googols they are driving car or some time in party how and where will the customer use it when rayban company started in  the most of consumer wearing this just for protect their eyes from sunraysbut now its become part of fashionif somebody wearing a branded cloths and if he also wearing a branded sunglasses not anyone its give a good impressionrayban sunglasses comes in only three colors like black silver and golden rayban have many models in this three colorsrayban sunglasses wearing by most famous personalities in whole woldits become a symbol of living statuesand rayban company never try to sell their product at low price because of competition these all things create a branded product to rayban in market place when we talk about place the first thing is where do buyers look for your product or service rayban sunglasses is a world wide productrayban selling sunglasses in rayban show rooms and optical shopsrayban opened their showrooms in big cities and also selling in small citiesrayban sell their product in super moles and shopping complex rayban set a special shop in moles and also use net to sellso if somebody wants to purchase rayban sunglasses so he have all type of option for purchasingraybans product only for those consumer who have high purchasing powerso it is a product who shows your status in societies who want to use it for feel proud he purchase it by giving a high pricethere is no neet of any type of sales force price price decisions some examples of pricing decisions to be made include pricing strategy skim penetration etc suggested retail price volume discounts and wholesale pricing cash and early payment discounts seasonal pricing bundling price flexibility price discrimination rayban using skimming strategy for pricingbecause rayban company build their image as a good brand so company use it and skimming the market sharethere is no price flexibility company use same price strategyin winter company give some discount what is the value of the product or service to the buyer promotion in the context of the marketing mix promotion represents the various aspects of marketing communication that is the communication of information about the product with the goal of generating a positive customer response marketing communication decisions include the rayban brand then becomes meaningless as whole and its meaning is diffused and fragmented over the millions of viewers who are individually making up the rayban brand meaning hotmails approach kept the power of the brand and therefore its meaning equity and potential for building preference in its message and provided a way through a hotlink in which consumers could immediately subscribe and get more information on hotmail and its brand with rayban if one reads the comments posted on sites like youtube concerning their viral videos very few even know what they are really watching most think only they are good videos with the discussion centering around how the videos were made not about rayban its never hide campaign or even sunglasses so what is rayban trying to do brand must retain control what marketers must remember is that for any brand to be successful the brand must control the flow content and meaning of the message it conveys if it wants to increase market share and allimportant preference the power of any good brand lies in its ability to connect with the target audience on a highlycharged emotional level this connection and meaning however can only be molded and derived from the brand itself not from individual consumers rather than a single cohesive and comprehensive brand meaning the brand would have as many meanings as there are current and potential customers a marketing model that is inefficient and prohibitively expensive rayban is not alone in jumping on the viral marketing bandwagon while the promise still exists to exploit this kind of marketing in a way that is truly brandcentric and can unleash the true power of brand marketers have yet to uncover the formula for most brands viral marketing is a virus brands can still do without key points the marketing mix of rayban define the marketing elements for successfully positioning rayban product market offer one of the best known models is the four ps which helps define rayban price strategy marketing options in terms of product place and promotion request removal if you are the original writer of this essay and no longer wish to have the essay published
