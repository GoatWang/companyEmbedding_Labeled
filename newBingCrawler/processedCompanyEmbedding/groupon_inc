receive a group discount founder eric lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on group buying born from the point groupon was launched in november  the name groupon is a blend

which has ties to comcast corp the firm was founded by former comcast chief financial officer michael angelakis who launched the firm earlier this year with more than  billion in committed capital from comcast in late october  groupon announced that it is acquiring dailydeals provider livingsocial businessedit business modeledit when it first launched the company offered one groupon per day in each of the markets it served the groupon worked as an assurance contract using thepoints platform if a certain number of people signed up for the offer then the deal became available to all if the predetermined minimum was not met no one got the deal that day this reduces risk for retailers who can treat the coupons as quantity discounts as well as sales promotion tools in the early years before revenue splits began to adjust as necessary groupon made money by keeping approximately half the money the customer pays for the coupon currently that split can vary depending on many factors for example in a  revenue split if  worth of home painting services are purchased by the consumer for  through groupon then the business gets  and groupon keeps  there are certain businesses to which groupon initially did not offer its services including shooting ranges and strip clubs however shooting ranges have been featured on groupon  unlike classified advertising the merchant does not pay any upfront cost to participate consumers are able to search and browse deals via web or mobile and can subscribe to receive emails featuring deals they are interested in based on preferences they input groupon employs a large number of copywriters who draft descriptions for the deals featured by email and on the website groupons promotional text for the deals has been seen as a contributing factor to the popularity of the site featuring a distinctive mix of thorough factchecking and witty humor groupons customer base primarily is female and has a college education there are potential problems with the business model for example a successful deal could temporarily swamp a small business with too many customers risking a possibility that customers will be dissatisfied or that there wont be enough product to meet the demand gap a large clothing retailer was able to handle  coupons in a national deal although it experienced server problems at one point but a smaller business could become suddenly flooded with customers one coffee shop in portland oregon struggled with an increase in customers for three months when it sold close to  groupons on the one day it was offered according to one report in response to similar problems groupon officials state that deals sold will be capped in advance to a number that the business can service effectively groupon encourages new customers to try local businesses  of merchants agree that their groupon deal brought in new customers and  of customers say they are likely to return to the merchant again in a  techcrunch analysis of groupon writer rakesh agrawal predicted that over time groupons merchant customer base would contract to only those businesses that could profitably exploit its business model such as yoga studios or other services that could offer customers longterm subscriptions not bound by the groupon terms when the company reported in the second quarter of  that its revenues had declined along with customer growth and the amount of money existing customers spent on the site slate tech journalist farhad manjoo said agrawal had been vindicated agrawals prediction however did not hold true as a

social media toolkit  pros and cons of using groupon group buying may be all the rage among consumers but does is really make good business sense yes it can if you design the promotion just right for your company by carolyn m brown  comments credit getty groupon the group buying site offering daily deals has proven to be wildly popular with consumers great discounts are given for restaurants retail stores spas theaters and much more whats more appealing than scoring a  massage for  or grabbing a meal valued at  for  people love discounts especially during hard times when money is tight investors also are enamored with groupon google famously offered to buy the site for  billion but got rejected now all eyes are on the chicagobased firm to file for an initial public offering before the year ends a groupon ipo will likely generate a fortune for early investors according to market analysts launched in  groupon is a fast growing company having transformed the world of online shopping it has boosted the number of markets where it operates to  and has  million subscribers it has a staff of  working at locations in cities throughout the us and across  countries the company is rumored to have generated  million in revenue for  up from  million in  whos not loving groupon it appears to be merchants a study by rice universitys jesse h jones graduate school of business surveyed  small to midsize businesses in  cities spanning  product categories findings revealed  percent of the merchants said the groupon promotions were profitable while  percent said they were not more than  percent of the companies wouldnt run a groupon offer again restaurants fared the worst among service businesses with groupon deals while spas and salons were the most successfulthe real deal is that any business looking to use groupon or one of its competitors like livingsocial must have a much broader perspective you dont want to devote a lot of your budget to these daily deal sites such a promotion has to be part of your overall marketing plan along with how you are using facebook twitter google adwords and so on you can make a deal as long as its the right one for your line of businessthe problem is that businesses often go into a promotion without a good understanding of what they want to accomplish the rice study found that the ability of employees to handle the surge of business from bargain shoppers for example was critical to the success of that companys particular promotion the way it works is that groupon offers different deals each day for a local good service or event in a city where it operates discounts range from  percent to  percent off the promotion is only valid if a certain number of consumers purchase the deal within  hours groupon keeps  percent of the revenues from each coupon dealwhat happens is that the groupon promotion runs and then there is a flood of customers coming to their store says the studys author and jones school associate marketing professor utpal dholakia business owners dont think through their costs and how they are going to make money on the promotion so in turn they end up losing a lot of money they dont recover it from customer behavior he explainstake for instance a massage therapist who complained that everyone who came in for his promotion got a massage and then walked out most of them didnt spend anything beyond getting the freebie he lost money on the promotion itself and there was no way to recoup that lost dholakia suggests that instead of promoting a particular service such as a massage or a facial the owner should have promoted a particular dollar amountin other words he might have offered  worth of services for  this increases the chance that the consumer will come in and buy more than just one item now a newbie might come in to get a massage but then decide to get a facial as well you have to take advantage of an opportunity to crosssale other products and services you have to prepare your staff to engage customers you have to be careful how you structure the promotion says dholakia groupon has its pros and cons so you need to decide if this is something worth your business getting into here are five reasons in favor of and five reasons against group buying promotions dig deeper  tips for using groupon couponspros     it attracts a lot of consumers you can reach new customers by appealing to those who are looking for inexpensive deals and a chance to save money you get to charge lower prices to new customers who arent willing to pay more existing customers are willing to pay full price for products or services dholakia says that groupon promotions offer the most benefit for businesses in which the promotion does not cannibalize sales to existing customers     it advertises your business a groupon promotion can be a way to announce the existence of your business to consumers who are unfamiliar with your products or services you get to entice potential customers to try your goods the idea is that they are going to like it so much that they will come back and buy from you again you must make your promotion grab consumers but at the same time increase your potential conversion rate for repeat customers says dholakia    it helps move inventory use groupon deals to sell slow moving items in your inventory or unutilized services discounts seem to be most compelling for merchants with low cost of goods sold use price deals to promote a product that is not that expensive a groupon type promotion should be something that you do once in a while for a specific narrow limited reason adds dholakia    it builds relationships use price promotion deals for building customer relationships rather than just creating onetime buys recommends dholakia meaning instead of a restaurant owner offering  worth of food for  parcel it out to offer  worth of food for  over the customers next three visits dont offer discounts on a total bill rather offer a specialized discount for various products or services     it generates incremental revenue if you have a lowcost or fixedcost structure you can make money on promotions take an owner of a rockclimbing business that has existing equipment and a storefront the operating costs dont change based on the number of people who show up a coupon deal can actually generate some extra cash by getting more bodies into the facility customers paying  for a  service still nets the owner  per voucher dholakia says each merchant must know their costs factor in a price that draws customers project the number of costumers that will buy the coupon and estimate incremental revenuesdig deeper how groupon works for small businesses cons    deals attract lowend bargain seekers because the groupon customer base is made up of dealseekers and bargain shoppers they might not be willing to purchase beyond the value of the coupon so there are low rates of spending and low rates of return one problem with price deals is diminishing returns thus merchants need to put a cap on the number of deal coupons that are to be sold says dholakia     deals hurt the brand the obsession with price doesnt necessarily make for a lot of brand loyalty or even brand awareness one negative aspect of daily deal sites is that price promotions usually hurt the brand of the company offering it says dholakia it makes customers price sensitive when they get something at a much lower price they then become less inclined to pay full price for that same product or service in the future     deals dont generate repeat customers groupon has a low conversion rate for repeat customers according to marketing experts you may never see the person again once they use your coupon or that person may not be willing to buy from you again without a coupon in hand the percent of new customers that redeem the voucher that becomes repeat visitors of the business is estimated at around  percent it varies by product categories     deals are not profitable another problem is the split groupon keeps  percent of the revenues from each coupon deal if you do the math merchants need to gross margins well in excess of  percent for groupon to work for them the promotion is very steep usually  percent or more most businesses are built on margins of  percent which means if the customer just comes in and buys the deal the owner is going to loose money says dholakia restaurants usually have higher margins by offering huge discounts and giving  percent to groupon they just arent earning enough to cover the cost of serving that customer     there are better deals out there daily deals sites are not the only game in town you can run a similar promotion for less money there are plenty of marketing programs you can use does it make sense to use this one asks dholakia for example you can offer a discount or promotion on a facebook fan page its an effective way to engage new and existing customers at a very low cost he adds dig deeper how groupon can boost your companys exposurethe bottom line is that a good deal or promotion should attract customers give them the flavor for your companys products and services and then let them buy whatever they want at full price published on apr
