reblogsharetweetshareoceanside camarketwired  may    therapeutics solutions international inc otc pink tsoi announced today an exclusive licensing agreement with its subsidiary emvolio inc the patent outlicensed today to emvolio titled targeting the tumor microenvironment through nutraceutical based immunoadjuvants is an important and complimentary product to our previously announced licensing of stemvacs to emvoliothis product is being developed to allow clinicians to treat innate immune suppression by administration of oral apigeninpterostilbene cancer detox product in order to decrease immune suppressive toxic molecules made by the tumor and tumor microenvironment specifically the product is designed to inhibit the enzyme indolamine  deoxygenase ido which is responsible for breaking down tryptophan in the vicinity of the tumor and generating byproducts such as kynureninethe central role of ido in immune suppression has been demonstrated in tumors and pregnancy the parallels between stimulation of immunity to cancer and the natural pathological process that occurs in victims of recurrent spontaneous abortion provide a means for identifying and assessing molecular targets various herbal compositions containing apigenin have previously been shown to inhibit successful pregnancy accordingly we disclose the novel use of applying apigenin alone or in combination with metformin for stimulation of antitumor immunity in part through derepression of ido activity that is associated with tumors or with the tumor microenvironmentit is with great excitement we license this patent to emvolio today cancer metabolic detox is an integral part of emvolios overarching approach to treating cancer cancer is known to compromise the immune system at different levels we believe cancer treatment must attack cancer at different levels and emvolio with tsois assistance is developing products that can be used together as well as to be used alone or in combination with existing therapies said timothy dixon president and ceo of therapeutic solutions internationalthe unfortunate reality of cancer immunotherapy is that the immune system does not work in isolation as we have seen with the advent of checkpoint inhibitors although some advanced cancer patients undergo terrific responses the majority still have a mediocre or suboptimal response we believe that by developing combination approaches that target different aspects of the cancerimmune interaction we may be able to successfully increase the percentage of responders a similar combination approach was successfully used in hiv patients which resulted in patients living decades after infection said dr thomas ichim ceo of emvolio and director of therapeutic solutions internationalabout therapeutic
