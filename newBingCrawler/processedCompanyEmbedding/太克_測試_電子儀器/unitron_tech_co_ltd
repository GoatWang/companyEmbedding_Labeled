development neu nanofiber electrospinning unit the neu nanofiber electrospinning unit uses electrospinning techniques to safely and easily produce nanofibers with diameters of  to  nm this device is widely used in the automotive industry for research and development of filters and fuel cells the neu nanofiber electrospinning unit is capable of producing  to  nm diameter fibers the device’s biggest feature is the ability to produce nanofibers easily from a small amount of various polymers using an electrospinning technique currently use of nanofibers in raw materials it biotechnology and healthcare industries is expected to increase dramatically as manufacturers look to take advantage of increased surface area and finer fiber materials neu nanofiber electrospinning unit features nanofiber manufacturing principles as shown in the diagram the electrospinning device consists of a pointed positive electrode capillary and a flat negative ground electrode high voltage is applied between the two electrodes and the charged molten polymer or polymer solution coming from the capillary is attracted through the electric field toward the negative electrode at this point polymers with low molecular cohesion become a spray and those with high molecular cohesion are further separated into fibers that are attracted to the negative electrode where they form a thin layer of fibers development history despite active studies into electrospinning only handmade devices were available although researchers at drexel university attempted to manufacture a lab prototype no company capable of producing a device with high accuracy could be found in the us however kato tech co ltd in japan undertook the development of an electrospinning device for lab use and created a system that included a voltage generator and nozzle roller movement a quantitative syringe pump and a draft function this device largely featured the ideas of drexel university’s dr frank ko a leading authority on electrospinning and made it possible to create nanofibers easily using electrospinning yoshihiro yamashita associate professor at osaka seikei college neu nanofiber electrospinning unit
