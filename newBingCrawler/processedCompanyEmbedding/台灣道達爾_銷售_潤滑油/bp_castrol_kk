account the companys earnings per share and book value per share the graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock according to the theory any stock price below the graham number is considered undervalued and thus worth investing in as of today the stock price of bp castrol kk is  bp castrol kks graham number for the quarter that ended in mar  was na therefore bp castrol kks price to graham number ratio for today is na during the past  years the highest price to graham number ratio of bp castrol kk was  the lowest was  and the median

sqrt of tangible book per shareeps without nri ttm sqrt of  na  all numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio all numbers are in their local exchanges currency explanation ben graham actually did not publish a formula like this but he wrote in the intelligent investor  version regarding to the criteria for purchases current price should not be more than  times average earnings of the past three years current price should not be more than  times the book value last reported however a multiplier of earnings below  could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets as a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed  this figure corresponds to  times earnings and  times book value it would admit an issue selling at only  times earnings and  times asset value etc unlike valuation methods such as dcf or discounted earnings the graham number does not take growth into the valuation unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone it takes into account the earnings power therefore the graham number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation in general the graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock it cannot be applied to companies with negative book values bp castrol kks price to graham number ratio for today is calculated as price to graham numbershare price todaygraham number q mar   na na  all numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio all numbers are in their local exchanges currency be aware please keep these in mind  graham number does not take growth into account therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth we feel that if the earnings per share grows more than  a year graham number underestimates the value  graham number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings therefore an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of graham number  graham numbers underestimates companies that are light with book related terms eps without nri intrinsic value projected fcf intrinsic value dcf fcf based intrinsic value dcf earnings based tangible
