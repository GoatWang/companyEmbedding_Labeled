in malaysia it was royal dutch shell that began the oil exploration in sarawak then under the white rajahs at the end of the th century in  the first oil well was drilled in miri sarawak this became the first oil producing well known as the grand old lady shell was still the only oil company in the area in  when the federation of malaya having achieved independence from britain six years before united with sarawak and sabah both on the island of borneo and became malaysia the authorities in the two new states retained their links with royal dutch shell which brought malaysias first offshore oil field onstream in  meanwhile the federal government turned to esso continental oil and mobil licensing exploration off the state of terengganu in the malay peninsula the most populous region and the focus of federal power by  however only esso was still in the area it made its first discoveries of natural gas in that year and then rapidly made terengganu a bigger producer of oil than either sarawak or sabah by  malaysias output of crude oil stood at about  barrels per day  md setting up a state oil and gas company sedit several factors converged in the early s to prompt the malaysian government into setting up a state oil and gas company as first proposed in its five year plan published in  former chief minister of sarawak tun abdul rahman yakub was one of the people who proposed the idea of malaysia setting up their own oil company these were years in which power in the world oil industry began to shift away from the majors which then controlled more than  of the oil trade toward the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec as well as a proliferation of new private and state companies joining in the search for reserves by  the majors reduced in number from seven to five were producing less than  of the world total it seemed that malaysia would either have to join the trend or continue to leave its oil and gas entirely to royal dutchshell and esso multinational corporations necessarily attuned to the requirements of their directors and shareholders rather than to the priorities the government of a developing country might seek to realise further an agreement between malaysia and indonesia signed in  had settled doubts and disputes about each countrys claims over territorial waters and offshore resources at a time when both were heavily indebted to organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd governments and banks as well as to the international monetary fund imf and the world bank setting up a state oil and gas company through which the government could get international capital but avoid tangling with foreign oil companies or governments had worked for indonesia why not for malaysia as well the oil crisis of – made the government even more aware of malaysias dependence on foreign oil and foreign capital in general another factor in the decision was that the technology had recently been developed for extensive exploration and drilling offshore the local geography included a combination of broad basins of sedimentary rock with calm and shallow waters around the sunda shelf making exploration for gas and oil relatively easier and more successful than in most areas of the world malaysian crude turned out to be mostly high quality with low sulphur content a final and crucial factor in the creation of petronas and its continuation in much the same form since has been the political stability of malaysia since the restoration of parliament in  the country has been ruled by the national front barisan nasional the heirs to the alliance party which had been dominant from  to  and the originators in  of the new economic policy which was designed to improve the economic position of bumiputras—native malays and other natives in sabah and sarawak—relative to chinese and indian malaysians and to foreign corporations the difficulties this policy has caused for foreign companies and investors are outweighed by the benefits they believe they gain from malaysias political stability the malaysian government chose to create a state company rather than using taxes production limits leasing or other familiar instruments of supervision the government wanted and needed the cooperation of the majors but also sought to assert national rights over the use of the countrys resources a state company having both supervisory powers over the majors and production activities of its own was a workable compromise between allowing the majors full rein and excluding them along with their capital and expertise altogether petronas was established in august  and operates under the terms of the petroleum development act passed in october  it was modelled on pertamina the indonesian state oil and gas company founded in  in succession to permina which had been set up in  according to the  plan petronas goals would be to safeguard national sovereignty over oil and gas reserves to plan for both present and future national need for oil and gas to take part in distributing and marketing petroleum and petrochemical products at reasonable prices to encourage provision of plant equipment and services by malaysian companies to produce nitrogenous fertilisers and to spread the benefits of the petroleum industry throughout the nation on  september  malaysias then prime minister tun abdul razak announced the appointment of tengku razaleigh hamzah as chairman and chief executive of petronas tun razak said from among the new blood i intended to bring tengku razaleigh into the cabinet however i have an important job for him a job as important as that of a cabinet minister i have decided to appoint him as chairman and chief executive of petronas which is equivalent to being a cabinet minister subsequently razaleigh had to relinquish his job as chairman of pernas which he held from  but retained the chairmanship of bank bumiputra having created petronas the government had to choose what forms its dealings with private oil companies would take starting with its legal monopoly on oil and gas activities and resources it had several options it could simply award concessions without taking part in production management or profits it could try offering services at the supply end or it could make contracts to cover profitsharing productionsharing joint ventures—sharing both profits and costs—or all stages of the process under carriedinterest contracts petronas first move was to negotiate the replacement of the leases granted to royal dutchshell on borneo and to esso in the peninsula with productionsharing contracts which have been the favoured instrument alongside joint ventures ever since these first contracts came into effect in  allowing for royalties to both federal and state governments and for cost recovery arrangements they laid down that the remainder would go  to petronas and  to the foreign company esso began oil production in two offshore fields in  exporting its share of the supply unlike petronas whose share was consumed within the country petronas went downstream for the first time in  when it was chosen by the association of south east asian nations asean to begin construction on the second asean joint industrial project a urea plant the subsidiary asean bintulu fertiliser abf is based in sarawak and now exports ammonia and urea all over the world also in  malaysia became a net exporter of oil but exports were at such a low level as to make the country ineligible to join opec this situation benefited malaysia and petronas by allowing the company a degree of commercial and political flexibility and reinforcing petronas chief purpose malaysian selfreliance petronas supervised its foreign partners oil activities taking no direct role in production until  when the government saw to the creation of a subsidiary for oil exploration and production petronas carigali it began its work in an oil field off the peninsula petronas retained its supervisory powers over all oil and gas ventures particularly on issues of health and safety and environmental control battling oil depletion the late sedit this

template message fortunately for malaysia exploration was by no means at an end and could yet produce more reserves the seligi field which came onstream at the end of  and was developed by esso production malaysia was one of the richest oilfields so far found in malaysia waters and further concessions to the majors would encourage exploration of the deeper waters around malaysia where unknown reserves could be discovered meanwhile computerised seismography made it both feasible and commercially justifiable to reexplore fields which had been abandoned or were assumed to be unproductive over the past century in  petronas invited foreign companies to reexplore parts of the sea off sabah and sarawak on the basis of new surveys using uptodate techniques another way to postpone depletion was to develop sources of oil and of its substitute natural gas outside malaysia late in  the governments of vietnam and myanmar burma invited petronas carigali to take part in joint ventures to explore for oil in their coastal waters in  a new unit petronas carigali overseas sdn bhd was created to take up a  interest in a field in myanmars waters being explored by idemitsu myanmar oil exploration co ltd a subsidiary of the japanese firm idemitsu oil development co ltd in a production sharing arrangement with myanma oil and gas enterprise thus began petronas first oil exploration outside malaysia in may  the governments of malaysia and thailand settled a longrunning dispute over their respective rights to an area of  square kilometres in the gulf of thailand by setting up a joint administrative authority for the area and encouraging a joint oil exploration project by petronas the petroleum authority of thailand and the us company triton oil in a separate deal in october  the petroleum authority of thailand arranged with petronas to study the feasibility of transferring natural gas from this jointly administered area through malaysia to thailand by way of an extension of the pipelines laid for the third stage of the peninsular gas utilisation project that project was on course to becoming a major element in the postponement of oil depletion contracts for line pipes for the second stage of the project were signed in  with two consortia of malaysian japanese and brazilian companies this stage completed in  included the laying of  kilometres of pipeline through to the tip of the peninsula from where gas could be sold to singapore and thailand the conversion of two power stations—port dickson and pasir gudang—from oil to gas and the expansion of petronas output of methyl tertbutyl ether mtbe propylene and polypropylene which were already being produced in joint ventures with idemitsu petrochemical co of japan and neste oy of finland the third and final stage of the project was to lay pipelines along the northwest and northeast coastlines of the peninsula and was completed in  another new venture in  was in shipowning since petronas existing arrangements with misc and with nigerias state oil company would be inadequate to transport the additional exports of lng due to start in  under the contract with saibu gas petronas did not lose sight of the governments commitment to malaysian selfreliance and the companys second refinery at malacca completed in  with a capacity of  barrels per day  md promoted the same policy the fact that it was built in a joint venture with samsung of korea the chinese petroleum corporation of taiwan and caltex of the united states did not negate the policy for the subsidiary company petronas penapisan melaka had a decisive  of equity while sharing the enormous costs of and gaining advanced technology for the project more to the point a side effect of the refinerys completion was that petronas was able to refine all of the crude oil it produced instead of being partially dependent on refining facilities in singapore petronas with its policies of promoting selfreliance helping to develop associated industries and varying the sources and uses of oil and gas played an important role in the malaysian economy as a whole under governments which—by current if not historical western standards—were strongly interventionist the contribution of oil taxes to the federal governments revenue hovered at around  to  until  when it showed a marked increase to
