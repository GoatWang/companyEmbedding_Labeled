in other economic sectors services mining and electricity the company is majorityowned by antarchile sa which functions as the holding company for the interests of the angelini group big fuel distributor  compania de petróleos de chile sa was founded in  by a team of chilean entrepreneurs with the goal of importing and distributing fuels in the national territory the objective was to assure the flow of these supplies which had been undermined by the scarcity of chilean currency that occurred with the onset of the great depression although faced by competition from the major world oil companies copec was able to establish a national distribution network with service stations and storage tanks and to make itself the national leader in its field copecs first venture outside its original business started in  when it began selling vehicles machinery and tires and accessories in  when fuel supply shortages began to bite again due to world war ii the company created sociedad de navagación petrolera sonap which acquired an oil tanker the first to sail under the national flag in  in collaboration with two other oil companies it formed the pipeline company sonacol the following year copec joined with mobil oil corp to construct a modern plant for the manufacture of lubricants with the purpose of producing and distributing a complete line of fats and oils under the mobil name in  the company took a stake in abastible sa an enterprise distributing liquid natural gas to homes and industry it gradually took control of this company which eventually became abc comercial ltda through successive augmentations of capital copec in  joined with the chilean subsidiaries of essothat is standard oil co of new jerseyand shell oil the royal dutchshell group to establish sociedad de inversiones de aviacion ltda siav dedicated to the supply of fuels lubricants and other aviation products by this time copec was by far the richest commercial company in chile forestry foremost  in  the government of chile had established the corporación de fomento de la producción corfo a state body to plan and direct the nations industrial development aside from providing subsidies to private companies and protecting them from foreign competition with high tariffs corfo took a considerable stake in many enterprises especially in sectors such as electricity steel and petroleum following the military coup that overthrew the leftwing socialist government of  a wide program of privatizing state enterprises was instituted the nations largest holding company of this period representing the cruzat and larraín families took control of copec they put the company into the forestry business by purchasing governmentowned empresa forestal arauco ltda and industrias de celulosa arauco sa in  for  million this network of forest tracts sawmills and cellulose woodpulp plants was augmented in  by the purchase from corfo of celulosa constitución sa which was merged with celulosa arauco to form celulosa arauco y constitución sa at the same time four new forestry subsidiaries were established to develop forestry resources in southern chile for parent copec which was now the largest privately owned enterprise in the nation the chilean forestry industry was being aided by climatic conditions that were thought to foster the rapid growth of the radiata pine which was introduced into the country from the monterey peninsula of california these conditions included large shifts in temperature each day nutrientrich soil an environment relatively free from disease steady and reliable rainfall and proximity to the sea a government forestry official told shirley christian of the new york times here the radiata pine has found a better place to grow than its place of origin in addition the forestry industry was diversifying its roster of customers once heavily dependent on argentina chile was selling forestry products to more than  countries in  by  copec also had branched out into computation tourism and durable goods in that year it purchased a fishery pesquera guanaye ltda and two electricity suppliers and distributors sociedad austral de electricidad sa saesa and empresa eléctrica de la frontera sa frontel the following year it invested in coal deposits in farsouthern chile a joint venture with british investors that gave rise to compania de carbones de chile cocar sa but the severe financial crisis that ensued and that affected all of latin america found copec hobbled by bad financial investments and high foreigncurrency debt in the wake of the virtual collapse of the chilean peso the cruzatlarraín group could not pay its debts and had to surrender the enterprise anacleto angelini fabbri owner of the fourth largest group in chile acquired  percent of the companys shares in  including corfos  percent holding angelini was an italian immigrant who after arriving in chile in  founded a paint factory with a few machines and  in capital and later established a construction firm in collaboration with chilean associates he acquired in  a fishery pesquera eperva sa in  this company bought for only  million the states controlling interest in pesquera indo sa which became the first modern enterprise in chile for the largescale production of fishmeal and fish oil in  eperva and indo bought the governments  percent share of pesquera iquique a fish processor dating from  iquique became the second largest company in its field and grew sevenfold between  and  the largest was pesquera chilemar sa a fishing fleet that dated from  and also was owned by angelini angelini entered the forest products business in  by means of an investment in the company sociedad maderas prensadas cholguán sa twenty years later forestal cholguán sa was split off from this company to take charge of the strictly forestry end including  hectares  acres of pine plantations angelini was financially prudent and thus in a position to acquire the interests of the debtridden conglomerates such as cruzatlarraín that emerged in the privatizations of the s but failed in the s he was allowed to do so even in basic resource industries although as of  he had not taken chilean citizenship not wanting to renounce his italian nationality his partner in copec was carter holt harvey holdings ltd a new zealand conglomerate that converted  million of chilean debt that it held into equity and added  million of its own cash angelini and carter holt harvey jointly held  percent of copec through a holding company inversiones y desarrollo los andes sa with  affiliates copec was the major holding company in chile at the end of  angelini was chosen as the entrepreneur of the decade by the business magazine gestion angelini more or less ignored the petroleumdistributing aspects of copec to concentrate on export growth in the forestry and fishing sectors to provide more raw material for paper copec opened the most modern cellulose plant in chile in  and it united two fisheries in  to form pescuera iquiqueguanaye sa igemar the largest in chile eperva acquired chilemar in  and indo in  subsequently absorbing both companies copec established aserradores arauco sa in  to consolidate its sawmill activities and added paneles arauco sa in  to produce wood strips and panels celulosa arauco y constitución bought argentinas largest woodpulp producer and its only woodpulp exporter alto paraná sa in  that year copec entered gas distribution in santiago by taking a stake in metrogas sa which had become the principal company in this field the conglomerates holdings in electricity distribution became larger with the acquisition in  of empresa energía río negro sa which was active in southern argentina from  to  copec had entered mining by organizing a company to explore hydrocarbon deposits in colombia and by taking a majority share of compania minera cancan sa which began mining metals in  raising the stakes  by  copec was valued on chiles stock market at more than  billion it held nearly half of the fuel distribution market in chile with about  service stations which included cafeterias stores and minimarkets and its own credit card tct but the chief enterprise in importance was celulosa arauco y constitución representing  percent of its profit and exporting to  countries in  it was chiles largest exporter outside of the mining sector despite low prices for wood pulp arauco as the lowestcost producer in the world was earning a profit perfectly symmetrical rows of fastgrowing pine trees from the companys more than one million acres of forest were being sent to sawmills and factories for conversion to bleached pulp and eventually into paper products particle board and furniture relations with carter holt harvey had deteriorated after international paper co purchased majority control of the new zealand firm in  in  international papers stake in copec was purchased by antarchileangelinis holding companyfor  billion to pay for this antarchile raised  million by a public offering of stock and also took out a fiveyear  million loan also in  copec purchased angelinis forestal cholguan for  million this brought the company  acres  acres of forest a sawmill and two processing plants one of them making a highly soughtafter woodandfiber panel called trupán in  copec earmarked  billion for a second huge cellulose plant in valdivia and the following year it opened two woodpanel plants one in chile and one in argentina to help pay down the debts it had incurred copec shed its electricity distribution interests in  including the sale of its longtime distributors saesa and frontel for some  million by  copecchosen company of the year by the chilean business magazine capitalwas the worlds sixth largest producer of cellulose turning out more than  million metric tons of pulp a year its  sawmills had a capacity of almost  million cubic meters per year the five woodpanel plants had a combined capacity of nearly one million cubic meters the valdivia cellulose plant scheduled to come on line in  with capacity to produce  metric tons a year was to be accompanied by sawmills and other works copec already had in mind still another cellulose plant in itata that could be operating at the end of  wood pulp had become chiles second largest export after copper but commodity prices often fluctuated as for example when the  financial crisis in asia seriously reduced demand from some of the products chief customers copec and its chilean competitors had by then begun focusing on turning out wood products of greater added value and less price volatility copecs wood panels and moldings for example were strips of pine highly prized for their clear knotfree wood despite strong results copec was finding that investing in the forestry sector was expensive given that new plantings of trees were continuously required but could not be harvested for at least  years copecs purchase of alto paraná was attractive because land was cheaper in argentina trees grew faster there were fewer environmental regulations and no problemsas in chileof conflicts with indians who lived in the most heavily forested zones chilean forestry companies also were being courted by uruguay in  copec owned  hectares  million acres of forests in chile  hectares  acres in argentina and  hectares  acres in uruguay about twothirds of these holdings in chile and about half in argentina and uruguay were in plantations chiefly of radiata pine or eucalyptus copecs fuel distribution business had  service stations in  plus an industrial channel that was supplying fuel to  construction electrical fishing forestry and mining customers the company also held  percent of metrogas and through abastible remained in the business of distributing liquid natural gas fishing was a poorperforming sector of copecs holdings although it held  percent of the world fishmeal market but in  igemar returned to the black after years of incurring losses in all copec earned clp  billion  million on revenues of clp  trillion  billion in  fuels accounted for  percent of sales but only  percent of profit forestry for only  percent of sales but  percent of profit the companys longterm debt at the end of the year was clp  trillion  billion at  years of age in  anacleto angelini rated the fourth richest man in latin
