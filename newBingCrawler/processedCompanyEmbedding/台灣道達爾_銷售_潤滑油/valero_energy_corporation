owns and operates  refineries with a combined capacity of  million barrels per day about  percent of this capacity is in the gulf coast region through refineries in texas louisiana and aruba the remaining refineries are on the west coast the midcontinent region and in the northeast valero also markets refined products on a wholesale basis through a bulk and rack marketing network and via more

marketing reach extends to  us states canada latin america and the caribbean region the company also owns a  percent interest in valero lp a publicly traded limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined product pipelines refined product terminals and crude oil storage facilities mainly located in texas oklahoma new mexico colorado and california valero energy was founded as a natural gas pipeline on the first day of  in an effort to diversify itself into a broadbased energy firm the company purchased a petroleum refinery shortly after its inception renovation and startup of this facility in a difficult world petroleum market nearly put valero out of business the company subsequently sold off its natural gas properties to a limited partnership to retain financial stability and concentrate on its refining activities conditions in the petroleum industry repaid this gamble and valero energy thrived in the late s and early s from there the valero of the early st century was largely engineered through acquisitions from  to  the company acquired  of the  refineries it now operates the biggest of these deals came in december  when valero bought ultramar diamond shamrock corporation for about  billion in cash stock and assumed debt thereby gaining six refineries and vastly enlarging its retail operations gas gathering pipeline beginnings as coastal states spinoff the company was created by the texas railroad commission the states energyregulating authority to rectify the misdeeds of the lovaca gathering company one subsidiary of the coastal states gas corporation valeros corporate precursor in the s coastals chairman oscar s wyatt jr had signed contracts to deliver gas to many customers including several large texas cities at low prices with the expectation that costs for gas would not rise by  and  however gas prices had risen dramatically and the company was not able to fulfill its contracts the texas regulatory board allowed coastal to pass on its higher prices to customers and to make a small profit rather than see the company go out of business the question of the penalty for coastals broken contracts became a matter of litigation that stretched through the mids finally in december  the commission ruled that coastal would have to refund  billion—more than the company was worth—to its customers to satisfy this ruling coastals intrastate texas gasgathering pipeline was spun off into a new company valero former coastal customers were awarded  percent of the new companys equity while the other half went to coastals shareholders with the exception of wyatt in addition coastal was ordered to spend  million exploring for new gas over the next decade and a half any new gas found would be sold to valero at a rate  percent below the current market price valero also got a  million chunk of coastal stock thus at its birth valero became the largest intrastate pipeline in texas with  miles of transmission lines assets worth  million and startup revenues exceeding  billion in addition valero had the right to charge customers ten cents per million cubic feet mcf over its cost of gas in its first year and  cents over mcf in its second guaranteeing the company a profit of at least  million valeros stock was slated to be listed on the new york stock exchange shortly after its formal inaugural to separate itself from its corporate parent valero chose to locate its headquarters in san antonio the city was both the companys largest customer and an outpost  miles from coastals houston home the companys name was taken from the mission of san antonio de valero the original name of the alamo as its president the company chose bill greehey formerly the courtappointed head of lovaca greehey had been instrumental in negotiating the outofcourt settlement that resulted in valeros formation beyond valeros basic gas business greehey planned to expand into gas storage and oil and gas exploration as well as coal and oil refining he planned to make valero a fully integrated energy company as he told a fortune correspondent in january  in its first year of existence valero moved quickly to solidify its position and expand into the nonregulated areas of its industry the company tapped into new supplies of gas signing contracts in mexico and texas and also added new storage facilities announcing that it would spend  million expanding its production of natural gas liquids—which at the time were selling at high prices—the company planned to build a  million processing facility and construct a mile pipeline valero also spent  million on tentative moves into the gas exploration and drilling business first move into refining early s valero made its most significant investment late in  when it bought a onehalf interest in saber energy inc a small marketer of gasoline for  million with its new partner valero planned to turn sabers tiny gasolineproducing operation in corpus christi texas into a stateoftheart specialized refinery the facility was designed to use the product at the bottom of a barrel of crude oil—a highsulfur tarlike substance known as atmospheric residual oil abbreviated resid—as its raw material or feedstock resid was obtained as a byproduct of the processing of raw crude oil and generally cost significantly less than a barrel of crude which was the feedstock of a conventional refinery by cracking resid in a complicated and expensive process sabers refinery would create highquality gasoline in the saber partnership the company made its bid to become a broadbased energy concern in  valero embarked on the construction of the new refining facility which was slated to cost  million in addition the company revamped its somewhat ineffective exploration and production operation moving aggressively to get underway and opening regional offices in midland and houston texas denver colorado and new orleans louisiana by the end of the fiscal year valeros net income had risen to  million an increase of more than  percent from the previous year by  texas was in the grip of a severe recession and valeros outlook was growing less rosy the companys earnings from its core businesses—gas sales and transportation of other peoples gas through valeros pipelines—went into decline in an effort to counteract losses valero joined in industry efforts to encourage the shipment of gas directly to large commercial customers which helped somewhat to prop up its earnings in its new endeavors valero had mixed success although the company had spent  million on exploration it had yet to benefit from these efforts valeros natural gas liquids business however proved prosperous the company had increased its gas liquids capabilities by  percent building eight plants at a cost of  million to stockpile ethane butane and propane and these facilities contributed significantly to valeros profits if not for gas liquids greehey told business week in  we would have been in trouble mids travails the biggest problem proved to be valeros large investment in the saber gasoline refinery two years into the project estimated costs had reached  million the most ever spent per barrel of oil on a refinery valero had taken on  million in debt to finance construction and by  the project was behind schedule experiencing difficulties meeting federal air pollution standards the company was forced repeatedly to postpone full startup of the facility in addition the economics of the refinery had shifted significantly since the projects inception when valero had started out resid had been very cheap while gasoline the refined product had been selling at a relatively high price this justified large expenditures to convert one into the other by  however the cost of valeros raw materials had risen and an oversupply of gasoline had driven prices for its end product down dramatically reducing the potential profitability of the refinery the cost of raw materials for valeros refinery was driven up further in  when great britain suffered a coal strike unable to use coal as a fuel british industry turned to resid instead driving the demand and the cost of valeros feedstock to unexpected heights which at times exceeded the cost of straight crude oil as a result of this stroke of bad luck valeros saber refinery had still not become profitable by the middle of  company perspectives valero is a premier refining and marketing company that leads in shareholder value growth through innovative efficient upgrading of lowcost feedstocks into highvalue highquality products valero had certified to its lenders that the refinery was up and running two months after it had originally planned but even after this step was taken low gasoline prices meant that the plant was operating at a loss in august  heavy trading of valeros stock prompted speculation that the company would be the target of a takeover saber posted losses of  million in the first half of  and by that fall its rapidly weakening financial condition had obligated valero to buy out its partner in doing so valero added sabers substantial debts to its own large tally of borrowed funds doubling its overall level of longterm indebtedness as a result the company was forced to omit a dividend to its shareholders in the quarter in which the consolidation was made to placate its worried bankers valero agreed to limit its spending on other areas of its business while it postponed payments to the bank on its loans with this news the price of the companys stock sank to its lowest point as investors anticipated the companys possible bankruptcy in an effort to shore up its financial condition in february  valero entered into an agreement with techniques davant garde group sa known as tag a holding company controlled by saudi arabian akkram ojjeh tag invested  million in valero as part of an agreement that the saudi investor would raise its interest in the company to onethird if valero could locate a cheap source of raw materials for its refinery in a second bid to raise funds valero sold off a  percent interest in its west texas pipeline system to internorth an energy company based in omaha nebraska the sale brought the financially beleaguered company  million by late spring of  more favorable conditions in the energy industry as a whole had begun to lift valeros prospects as costs for crude oil byproducts fell and the price of gasoline rose the saber refinery was able to increase its earnings posting a small operating profit for march despite this good news the company temporarily suspended its production of gasoline at the saber facility resuming operations in june the following month valeros agreement with tag the saudi investor was called off at the end of  valero reported losses of  million by early  valero was also suffering from a glut in its original field natural gas unable to sell the gas it had contracted at its founding in  to buy from its corporate parent coastal valero refused to fulfill its contracts and in january was sued by coastal for  million in the first of a number of takeorpay suits over gas purchase agreements that would not be resolved until the end of the decade in an effort to strengthen its financial position valero restructured  million of its debt in april  and got out of the coal business by selling off the mine it owned in indiana unable to make its expensive saber refinery profitable given conditions in the world oil market valero began to informally hunt for a buyer for the facility despite the drain on funds by the unprofitable refinery however improved performance in valeros pipeline operations enabled the company to finish the year in the black posting profits of  million restructuring and turnaround in the late s faced with the problem of a profitable gas business that was carrying a moneylosing refinery valero significantly restructured itself in early  the company spun off its natural gas pipeline and natural gas liquids businesses into a limited partnership valero natural gas partners lp in which it would hold a  percent share for this portion valero turned over  million of its own money as well as  million contributed by public equity investors the remainder of the gas partnerships funding was raised through the issuance of  million in notes in addition to these moves valero abandoned its attempts to find oil and gas reserves shutting down its exploration activities with the money from the divestiture of its gas assets valero was able to reduce its dangerously crippling debt load by more than  million restoring its balance sheet to relative health this meant however that the core of the company was its moneylosing refinery valero lost  million in the first six months of  on its refining and gasoline marketing activities key dates  valero energy corporation is formed as a spinoff of coastal states gas corporation specifically coastals intrastate texas gasgathering pipeline based in san antonio valero moves into refining by acquiring an interest in saber energy inc which operates a small refinery in corpus christi texas  valero begins a massive expansion of the corpus christi facility into a stateoftheart refinery  the expanded corpus christi refinery is up and running  valero spins off its natural gas pipeline and natural gas liquids business into valero natural gas partners lp in which it holds a  percent share company shuts down its exploration activities  company buys the  percent of valero natural gas partners it

diamond shamrock corporation is acquired in a  billion deal  a refinery in st charles parish louisiana is purchased from orion refining corporation  valero acquires el paso corporations aruba refinery  valero announces a definitive agreement to acquire premcor inc for  billion in cash and stock by  however the climate for petroleum refining had improved and valero began to see a turnaround in its fortunes lower prices for its raw materials coupled with reduced gasoline inventories and growing customer demand enabled the company to turn a profit of  million in the first half of the year noting that the recent turmoil in the oil and gas industry had put many refineries out of business valeros leaders were confident that domestic demand for gasoline would continue to exceed refining capacity keeping prices high in addition the company counted on the fact that the product it refined was highquality highoctane cleanburning unleaded gas for which it anticipated a growing demand on the supply side valero noted that prices for resid had fallen as stockpiles had grown and the company moved to upgrade its refinery increasing capacity to assure future steady supplies of raw materials the company sought to take on a foreign petroleum producer as a joint owner in the refinery valero ended  with  million in posted profits the companys fortunes continued to improve in the following year valeros halfowned natural gas operations had profited from the deregulation of the gas industry it increased its sales by adding customers outside texas the company was able to transport through interstate gas pipeline linkups and sell gas to clients in other states and in mexico its number of gas processing plants had grown to  valero also continued to upgrade its oilrefining facilities the company added a device that enhanced the octane level of the gas it produced and also constructed a natural gas processing plant that split the gas into products to be used in petrochemicals or oil refining activities in  valero announced that it would own a  percent stake in a planned  million plant for processing gases given off in the refining process in corpus christi texas these measures along with the reduction in valeros debt load allowed the company to reduce its breakeven point for a barrel of refined oil from  when the plant had started up to  in  as a result of refinery upgrades and the strengthened market valero was able to restore its dividend payment in a sign of fiscal health in the second quarter of that year the company finished  with profits of  million continuing recovery in the early s valeros recovery from the severe difficulties it had experienced in the mids continued as the company moved into the s the world oil industry was thrown into turmoil in august  when iraq invaded major oil producer kuwait driving up the prices of both crude oil and refined petroleum products with this increased activity valero contracted for an additional  million investment in its refinery facilities the company ended the year with earnings of  million nearly double those of the year before in a reversal of earlier conditions petroleum refining accounted for a vast portion of the profits while the companys interest in its natural gas partnership contributed only  percent of the companys returns the launching of the allied offensive in the persian gulf in early  immediately drove petroleum prices down in anticipation of this effect however valero had sold much of its first quarter production in advance at inflated prices and added  million to its balance sheet although valero lost money when it was forced to shut down part of its production to make improvements to its plant the company completed  with record profits of  million looking to profit from the general move toward more environmentally conscious cleanerburning fuels such as natural gas and the highoctane products refined at its corpus christi facility valero continued to upgrade its plants in  in addition the company expected that by  their entire gasoline output would be made up of reformulated gasoline with an eye to further expansion the company solidified its balance sheet by repurchasing the outstanding shares of an old stock offering and sought permission to raise money for expansion by issuing new stocks valero also opened an office in mexico city in an effort to enhance its relationship with the mexican government and assist it in its search for clean energy in may  the company bought the  percent of valero natural gas partners it did not already own for about  million valero said that it wanted to expanded the natural gas business but that the limited partnership structure inhibited growth valero soon began seeking a buyer for the business however an effort that continued into  late s separation of natural gas operations launch of refining acquisition spree late in  valero officially announced plans to split the company up in order to concentrate solely on oil refining and marketing in mid valero completed a transaction whereby it sold its natural gas business to pge corporation for  million in stock and the assumption of  million in debt the deal was structured such that valeros oil refining and marketing unit was first spun off to existing shareholders prior to consummation of the pge transaction this spunoff unit retained the valero energy corporation name and the old valero energy was then merged into pge the  billion valero gained thereby was immediately leveraged to begin a massive multiyear acquisition spree that would catapult the company into position as one of the largest refiners in the united states the first acquisition of this buying binge also occurred in  valero bought the basis petroleum inc oil refining unit of salomon inc for about  million in cash and stock basis operated three refineries on the us gulf coast two in texas in texas city and houston and one in louisiana in krotz springs the three refineries had a combined capacity of  barrels per day more than doubling valeros existing output from its original refinery although the basis refineries had been operating at a loss for salomon this was in a way a positive for valero the facilities were in need of improvements giving valero an opportunity to overhaul the refineries just as it had done with the corpus christi plant already in late  the company announced plans to increase capacity at all three basis facilities after losing out to fellow san antonio refining company tesoro petroleum corporation in the bidding for a shell oil company refinery in anacortes washington valero succeeded in a september  deal that saw it acquire a mobil corporation refinery in paulsboro new jersey purchased for about  million the refinery was located about  miles south of philadelphia on the delaware river and produced  barrels per day increasing valeros refining base by  percent the deal geographically diversified valeros production facilities and provided it with entrée into the markets of the northeast a blockbuster deal and blockbuster earnings in the early s after seeing its bottom line suffer in the late s because of low crude oil prices valero along with the rest of the us refining industry entered a new era of fat profits in the new century soaring crude oil prices surging demand for refined products and refineries operating at or near their capacities produced a volatile mix leading to higher prices at the pump and soaring net income for the refiners as this new era began valero accelerated its strategic spending spree which centered on buying plants for a slim fraction of their replacement value in  the company gained further geographic diversity by buying exxon mobil corporations refinery in benicia california for  million the barreladay refinery located near san francisco was a very good fit for valero because it could process heavy crude oil and nearly  percent of its output was cleanerburning gasoline specifically the reformulated gasoline required by the california air resources board the deal also marked valeros entry into the retailing market as it included about  gasoline stations mainly in northern california valero envisioned the gasoline retailing business providing it with a buffer against the more volatile refining sector it soon debuted the valero retail brand at some of the acquired stations valero truly catapulted itself into retailing—and into the ranks of the major players in the us oil industry—through its unexpected acquisition of ultramar diamond shamrock corporation uds in a deal completed on the last day of  the price was shocking for a company that just a few years earlier had only one refinery about  billion in cash and stock and the assumption of  billion in debt valero gained from uds six refineries with a combined capacity of  barrels per day they were located in wilmington california three rivers and mckee texas ardmore oklahoma denver colorado and quebec canada the deal also included udss nearly  retail gasoline stations operating under such names as diamond shamrock ultramar and beacon valero also gained control of shamrock logistics lp soon renamed valero lp which owned and operated a mile network of crude oil and refined products pipelines valero was now the top independent refiner in the united states and one of the leading gasoline retailers as well with the completion of the uds deal valero saw its revenues soar jumping from  billion in  to  billion the following year to gain regulatory approval for the uds acquisition valero had to sell udss golden eagle refinery located in the san francisco area along with  northern california service stations these assets were sold to tesoro petroleum in  for  million the integration of uds into valero was completed without layoffs—a hallmark of the way greehey did business even when greehey sold the natural gas business to pge he insisted on extracting a promise from the acquirer that none of his former employees would be laid off although in each of the several huge mergers that rocked the oil industry in the late s and early s thousands of employees had lost their jobs as a result greehey according to the san antonio expressnews simply said thats not the valero way the company under greeheys leadership was also well known for its generous corporate giving program two more refinery acquisitions followed in the wake of the uds deal in july  valero spent about  million for a refinery in st charles parish louisiana that had daily capacity of  barrels purchased from the financially troubled orion refining corporation for  percent of its replacement cost this refinery located adjacent to the mississippi river was again a perfect fit for valero in that it could process cheaper heavy sour crude oil while meeting environmental regulations in march  valero bought a barrelperday refinery located on aruba from el paso corporation for  million plus about  million for working capital—a price that represented only about  percent of the replacement cost this refinery too was capable of processing heavy sour crude valeros strategy of basing its feedstock largely on sour crude oil which was selling at a large discount to sweet crude oil—the discount having averaged more than  per barrel in —paid off big in  and  after posting profits of  million on  billion in revenues in the former year valero then nearly tripled its profits one year later making  billion on revenues of  billion by  the company every day was turning two million barrels of crude oil into  million gallons of gasoline which amounted to  percent of the us supply while there were many skeptics who believed the next oil industry bust was right around the corner greehey for one remained quite optimistic contending that the conditions that had created the boom—high crude oil prices increasing demand for refined products and refinery utilization at or near capacity—were likely to continue he told the san antonio expressnews in july  i think at least for the next four or five years the refining business is going to be absolutely the best business to be in underscoring this conviction and catapulting it into the lead in domestic crude oil refining the company inked a deal in may  to acquire premcor inc by the end of the year for  billion in cash and  billion in stock valero was likely to pursue additional acquisitions of refinery assets as well as increase the capacity of a number of its existing refineries in the years to come principal

articles  essays order papers hire writer login valero energy corporation strengths are the one component of internal analysis the component describes any resources and capabilities that support a company to achieve its competitive advantage such as patents excellent reputation low cost structure and many more concerning the strengths of valero i see that the company has maintained continual efforts in developing every single company’s division to have competitive advantage over their rivals in this situation i see that the major strength of valero is the company’s position as the largest refiner in north america with extensive throughput capacity about   million barrels per day in addition valero also has distinctive strengths in the number of distribution outlets which outpaces the company’s rivals in the company official web site www valero com the company says that they have become a leader in its respective market with over  retail sites branded as ultramar valero beacon and diamond shamrock in major states in the u s  canada latin america and the caribbean in addition other key strengths of valero that stand the company out of the refineries industries include need essay sample on valero energy corporation we will write a custom essay sample specifically for you for only page proceed • listed as the world’s top refiner in  and  platts top  global energy company awards • mentioned by industryweek magazine as one of the world’s  bestmanaged companies this recognition is because valero has recorded and maintained excellent performance over years • acknowledged as the company who conduct best points of light foundation excellence in corporate community service award one of just nine u s companies honored in  this achievement should strengthen the valero’s brand equity in consumers’ mind and therefore it is very beneficial to the company’s competitive advantage read full documentthis is because consumers are likely to buy any product or service that is perceived to be high quality i  key weaknesses of valero the second internal factor in a swot analysis is weaknesses this is simply in contrast to the strengths of a company in which the weaknesses are shown in the absence of specific strength that lead to weaknesses of the company the weaknesses also include a lack of patent protection highcost structure and many more concerning the valero’s weaknesses i see that the company inability to manage their knowledge skills inventory was one obvious weakness the inability to manage the business was drawback to valero’s business since valero as major refiner in the u s and in the world needs to have human resource hr that meet the challenge in fastchanging and volatile valero’s oil refineries business in this situation hr division of valero should understand that corporate laborsupply chain department is key actor in supplying labor solutions that will include the likes of fulltime employees both us citizens and foreigners however in recent months i notice that valero has taken appropriate strategy to turn the company’s weakness into company’s strength the strategy was to recruit a hr human resource professional named dan hilbert about two years ago since the appointment of hilbert valero has conducted some suitable initiatives in their hr department including recruitment strategy process engineering and workforce planning to name a few i  core competencies of valero and initiatives to leverage the competencies the core competencies of valero are easily obtained from the company’s products and mission statement since they represent valero’s current competencies and initiatives that valero has taken to achieve it in the description of valero’s products i notice that valero has wide range of products including the production of premium environmentally save products such as california air resources board carb phase ii gasoline lowsulfur diesel and oxygenates based on the range of products that valero offers i can analyze which product or service that valero excels its competitors the analysis takes into account the valero’s mission statement since it explains the actions valero does to achieve the company’s goals that are to place their various products in most competitive position in the respective markets in the official website of valero i notice that the company’s mission statement comes in eight initiatives as shown below   to encourage any acts that increases the safety of our employees and our operations as a core business value in this first mission statement valero clearly defines that safety become their core competence  to produce environmentally clean products in clean facilities this statement also become competence of any oil companies since they are determined to produce clean products that do not harm our environment  to pursue growth opportunities both domestically and internationally this statement merely emphasize the financial objectives of valero and cannot be considered as valero’s competences since every company aims to achieve it  to develop all employees and regard them as our numberone asset this statement clearly become one of valero’s core competences this is because a refiner like valero needs to respond to the fastchanging oil refineries industry by acquiring and training their employees to keep to with the challenges  to provide a challenging rewarding environment that facilitates creative thinking teamwork and opens communications this is simply a statement that encourages internal elements employees managements and shareholders to serve the best  to improve customers’ satisfaction by providing reliable and responsive products and services there are no report providing facts about the comparison of level of satisfaction in oil refineries so that i do not consider this statement as core competence of valero  to ensure a positive retail experience for consumers by focusing on convenience value and quality service this can be considered as one of valero’s core competences since the company no only deals with oil production and refineries but also oil distribution in the case of oil distribution the major need of consumers is to have best quality of gasoline the statement about this quality of services is important since it describes the valero’s initiatives in delivering best quality of gasoline in their over  distribution outlets  to take a leadership role in our communities by encouraging employees’ involvement this is not a statement of valero’s core competences in fact it reveals valero’s commitment to serve communities as part of its corporate social responsibility csr program concerning the valero’s competence to develop all employees and regard them as our numberone asset the fourth number in the above list i notice that valero has carried out appropriate strategy to achieve it one of them is through the appointment of new manager of employment service named dan hilbert hilbert’s arrival in valero has significantly helped the company to improve and maintain its core competences since previously knowledge skills inventory became a weakness of valero some initiatives that support valero’s competence in human resources include acquisition of talents in oil industry process engineering and appropriate planning in workforce forman  says that those initiatives are proven beneficial for valero since it helps valero to grow into a great company by conducting proper transformation in valero’s staffing organization i  generic competitive strategy pursued by valero discussing valeros’ competitive strategy should address what the market needs current market situation in oil refinery industry is very challenging since the rising in the oil price will lead to negative impacts on a country’s economy in general and decrease company’s profits since customers must not accept the increase of gasoline price the rise of oil prices has increased industrial costs as a refiner valero needs to consider the impact of oil price rising since valero cannot change their gasoline price many times however the decision to keep the market price of gasoline in steady state might lead to the decrease of valero’s profit margin concerning the issue i notice that the generic competitive strategy that valero pursues is by carrying out a series of mergers and acquisition ma or in other terms valero do proper vertical integration by definition vertical integration is the practice to integrate various parts of business upstream and downstream in order to increase the effectiveness of a company for example an oil company that deals with the exploration of crude oil might decide to do vertical integration by doing merger and acquisition with a refineries and distribution network companies the reason of conducting these initiatives is they give valero possibility to control oil price and reduce supplier power that can increase the gasoline price based on the market condition therefore by building a company that operates the oil exploration to gasoline distribution valero gains advantages of delivering competitive pricing scheme in his historical journey i notice that valero has evolved from a gas exploration company into a comprehensive energy company that does not only deal with the exploration but also the refineries and distribution of energy below are some mergers and acquisitions that mark the development of valero into an energy company • in  valero commenced its first vertical integration initiative through the expansion into energy sector the expansion was carried out by acquiring a small crude refining operation in corpus christi texas in order to speed up the production at that time valero decided to spend over  billion to develop the stateoftheart refining unit in the u s • in  the acquisition of mobil’s paulsboro the process to achieve the vertical integration objectives of valero also happened in  when the company decided to acquire mobil’s paulsboro refinery by completing the important acquisition valero became the u s second largest independent refiner with a total production about  bpd • in  the acquisition of exxonmobil corporation the vertical integration process continues in  when valero acquired exxonmobil corporation’s benicia california the acquisition gave valero with additional store retail distribution chain and  companyoperated retail sites this acquisition is the example of the integration that enriches the process of the company’s sales and distribution network • in june  the acquisition of corpus christi refinery moreover in june  valero also committed to buy a refinery in corpus christi previously owned by subsidiaries of el paso corporation • in dec   the acquisition of san antoniobased ultramar diamond shamrock corporation late  became the historical date for valero as the company completed its largest transaction by doing a merger with san antoniobased ultramar diamond shamrock corporation the ‘married’ company greatly adds valero strengths as a company that grows through a series of vertical integration since valero became one of the nation’s top three refining and marketing companies at that time i  valero’s competencies and the pursue of the generic competitive strategy as mentioned at previous section i notice that the generic competitive strategy that valero is the initiatives to carry out a series of mergers and acquisition ma or in other terms valero do accurate vertical integration process in order to become the best energy company in the u s and in the world to pursue this generic competitive strategy i notice that the company’s four competencies are in line with the chase of the competitive strategy for example valero’s competencies to provide safetyworking environments to their employees are advantageous when valero acquires a company and set the same rules in addition valero’s competency in producing environmentally clean products in clean facilities is also supportive to the achievement of valero’s competitive strategy this is because to become the most preferred gasoline retailers valero needs to produce clean products that do not harm environment moreover valero’s competency in developing all employees’ skills also complies with this statement clearly become one of valero’s core competences this is because a refiner like valero needs to respond to the fastchanging oil refineries industry by acquiring and training their employees to keep to with the challenges imagine if valero has unmatched labor skills because of acquisition over other companies it could hurt valero i the long term since there is no standard requirement for their employees in compliance with the generic competitive strategy to be the best energy company valero also strengthen its competency to ensure a positive retail experience for consumers by focusing on convenience value and quality service the competencies that valero has and the competitive strategy that valero attains have put the company to be one of oil refiner that listed in fortune  company and becomes a company that has the largest number of refineries in north america filling stations nationwide and  employees part  external analysis ii  valero’s key opportunities the first external factor in swot analysis is opportunities these elements provide specific opportunities that may help a company to gain more profit and achieve sustainable growth they include unfulfilled customer need new technologies elimination of trade barriers and so on concerning the valero’s opportunities i see that market needs for highqualityrefined oil at affordable price becomes the key opportunities for valero this is due to valero has facilities from oil exploration to distribution therefore it has ability to control costs while its retailer competitors will hardly have similar condition since they depend on the price from refiners that account for  of total retail price figure  shows the cost to produce a gallon of oil in  and  figure  composition of oil retail price source energy information administration  a primer on gasoline prices another opportunity is the fact that current technology can only afford to produce about  barrels of gasoline from every  barrels of crude oil it means that valero could research some way to increase the efficiency of oil production so that they will have greater margin when the retail price is high and have no loss when the price is low ii  valero’s key threats in addition threats describe any changes in the external factors that may put any company in unsafe position in the market they include a change in consumer tastes new substitute products new regulations and many more in valero case i notice that the main threat is the volatility of crude oil price as shown in the figure  the price of crude oil accounts for  of total retail price in  therefore the increase in oil price still becomes critical and major problems of world economy and for an energy company like valero it could be a disaster since sometime they make profit but in other time they loose money its negative impacts seem to be the factors that haunt either industrialized countries or the developed ones another threat for valero is the natural disaster like hurricane katrina such disaster is potential to destroy valero’s major oil pipelines that will result in the higher costs to deliver oil to refineries ii  valero and environmental opportunities and threats the demand for producing environmentalfriendly gasoline becomes great opportunities for valero its series of acquisition over refineries in the united states gives benefits for valero since they are able to find the best method to produce the demanded gasoline as affordable price however the situation could be potential threat since in some states like california it is needed to produce reformulated gasoline to sell to customers in urban areas where the cost of production of such gasoline is much higher than that of regular gasoline in addition refiners also face some restriction in some states in which in the  states there are prohibition to use gasoline additive mtbe since the additive is found to be responsible of groundwater contamination for this reason federal bureau of land management is to issue environmental impact statement so that refiners like valero have the certainty whether to use oxygenated like mtbe ii  porter’s five forces of valero at the heart of this analysis is the industry analyzing model known as porter’s five forces model which details the threat of new entrants power of buyers power of suppliers rivalry among existing competitors and the threat of substitute products for energy industry that satisfies following diagram figure  porter’s diagram of five forces a degree of rivalry rivalry in energy industry is intense as there are about  outlets across the united states each of them might offer customers with highquality gasoline in much competitive price therefore a refiner and distributor of gasoline that could not fulfill this market requirement will be set aside from the competition figure  shows the various pricing of gasoline in some states in the u s the figure suggests that refiners and distributors like valero should keep up with the average market price by keeping their costs below the price figure  motor gasoline prices at retail outlets  dollars per gallon including taxes source energy information administration  a primer on gasoline prices b new entrants the threat of new entrants rises as the barrier to entry is reduced in a marketplace as more firms enter a market we will see rivalry increase and profitability will fall theoretically to the point where there is no incentive for new firms to enter the industry one of common barriers to enter an industry is brand loyalty in case of valero i notice that the threat of new entrants is quite low since within the past  years there are no new refineries due to state restriction for fear of damaging impact on environment however this situation could be overcome immediately if federal bureau of land management is finished to report about refinery’s impact on underground water sources and endangered species related essay samples energy crisis gas prices have become uncontrollable

carmakers energysummaryvalero energy’s throughput volumes and refining margins grew in the second quarter utilization rate was improved refined products demand a tailwind in the second half of valero provides better yield than peers and has disciplined capital management strategy with a focus on returning value to shareholdersvalero energy nysevlo posted strong results for the second quarter of  beating both eps and revenue estimates excluding the impact of an inventory valuation adjustment in the second quarter of  valeros eps grew  year over year in the second quarter of  higher refinery throughput slightly improved refinery margin and higher utilization rate drove the earnings growth source valero energy reports the refinery throughput increased in q as the above graph shows the throughput margin per barrel for the refining segment rose to  from  the refinery utilization rate was  compared to  in the yearago quarter valero energys midstream segment valero energy partners nysevlp too posted growth valero started reporting midstream as a separate segment from q source valero reports vlp segments operating income increased compared to q based on the companys adjusted numbers for q for comparable vlp operations valeros midstream operations should provide it some stability in periods when refining margins remain stretched source valero reports the yearoveryear decline in the above graph is attributed to the effect of the inventory valuation adjustment in q across refining and ethanol segments the ethanol segment margins were further pressured due to both higher energy costs and strong ethanol production by the industry improved refined products demand there were a couple of important positive developments that joseph w gorder vlos chairman and ceo discussed during the q earnings call emphasis added moving on to the refined products markets were pleased to see a rebound in distillate demand in addition to the strong gasoline pull by domestic and export customers downward trends and product inventories and structural shortages in the primary export markets for the us gulf coast provide an encouraging backdrop as we move into the second half of the year on the crude supply side were seeing the impact of the opec cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts but increased us drilling activity and crude production have supported attractive domestic sweet crude discounts relative to brent in the second quarter as a result we switched our refining system to a maximum light crude slate in june with current market conditions operating a system with flexibility to process a broad range of feedstocks is very beneficial positive movement in distillate and gasoline demand combined with downward trends in product inventories bode well for valero the second important point is valeros ability to process a range of feedstocks as required by market dynamics rfs costs biofuel blending costs was  million higher than in the second quarter of  valero expects this to improve in future joseph w gorder had to say this on the higher renewable identification numbers or rins prices we have been continuing to work this very actively and really the administration has been very receptive to conversations around this they are trying to do whats right and to fix broken processes and so we remain hopeful that point of obligation is dealt with properly and we also are hopeful that the epa uses its authority to adjust the rbos to be sure that the blend wall doesnt become a chronic problem going forward attractive yield valero energy has a long track record of consistent dividend increases its  yield is on the higher side compared to peeraverage source investor presentation valeros consistent per share dividend growth is partly attributable to companys share repurchases in second quarter alone the company bought back  million shares for  million this is reflected in the downward trend in the companys outstanding shares over the years in the graph below source valero reports i think the biggest factor contributing to valeros consistent dividend growth over the years was its disciplined capital management the company focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet its capital management strategy is summarized in the below slide source investor presentation valero energy is trading at an ltm pe of x this is lower
