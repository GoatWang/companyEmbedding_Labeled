wikipedia bull from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see bull disambiguation a charolais bull a bull is an intact ie not castrated adult male of the species bos taurus cattle more muscular and aggressive than the female of the species the cow the bull has long been an important symbol in many cultures and plays a significant role in both beef ranching and dairy farming and in a variety of other cultural activities contents  nomenclature  characteristics  reproductive anatomy  behavior  management  beef production  temperament and handling  handling  artificial insemination  uses  significance in human culture  see also  references  external links nomenclatureedit the female counterpart to a bull is a cow while a male of the species which has been castrated is a steer ox or bullock although in north america this last term refers to a young bull and in australia to a draught animal usage of these terms varies considerably with area and dialect colloquially people unfamiliar with cattle may refer to both castrated and intact animals as bulls a wild young unmarked bull is known as a micky in australia improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer also known as a stag in australia canada and new zealand in some countries an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig or ridgling the word bull also denotes the males of other bovines including bison and water buffalo as well as many other species of large animals including elephants camels elk moose and whales see also list of animal names characteristicsedit a scottish highland bull bulls are much more muscular than cows with thicker bones larger feet a very muscular neck and a large bony head with protective ridges over the eyes these features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd giving the winner superior access to cows for reproduction the hair is generally shorter on the body but on the neck and head there is often a mane of curlier wooly hair bulls are usually about the same height as cows or a little taller but because of the additional muscle and bone mass they often weigh far more in horned cattle the horns of bulls tend to be thicker and somewhat shorter than those of cows and in many breeds they curve outwards in a flat arc rather than upwards in a lyre shape it is not true as is commonly believed that bulls have horns and cows do not the presence of horns depends on the breed or in horned breeds on whether the horns have been disbudded conversely in many breeds of sheep indeed only the males have horns castrated male cattle are physically similar to females in build and horn shape although if allowed to reach maturity they may be considerably taller than either bulls or cows with heavily muscled shoulders but not necks reproductive anatomyedit see also cattle § anatomy the reproductive system of a bull bulls become fertile at about seven months of age their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches  centimetres  in that of a fully adult bull may be over  centimetres  in bulls have a fibroelastic penis given the small amount of erectile tissue there is little enlargement after erection the penis is quite rigid when nonerect and becomes even more rigid during erection protrusion is not affected much by erection but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure bulls are occasionally affected by a condition known as corkscrew penis the penis of a mature bull is about – cm in diameter and – cm in length the bulls glans penis has a rounded and elongated shape behavioredit a common misconception widely repeated in depictions of bull behavior is that the color red angers bulls inciting them to charge in fact like most mammals cattle are redgreen color blind in bullfighting it is the movement of the matadors cape and not the color which provokes a reaction in the bull managementedit beef productionedit other than the few bulls needed for breeding the vast majority of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years except where they are needed castrated as work oxen for haulage most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef a bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female and produces proportionately more leaner muscle frame score is a useful way of describing the skeletal size of bulls and other cattle frame scores can be used as an aid to predict mature cattle sizes and aid in the selection of beef bulls frame scores are calculated from hip height and age in sales catalogues this measurement is frequently reported in addition to weight and other performance data such as estimated breed value ebv temperament and handlingedit a bull paws up dust in a threat display a warning sign for a bulloccupied field adult bulls may weigh between  and  kilograms  and  lb most are capable of aggressive behavior and require careful handling to ensure safety of humans and other animals those of dairy breeds may be more prone to aggression while beef breeds are somewhat less aggressive though beef breeds such as the spanish fighting bull and related animals are also noted for aggressive tendencies which are further encouraged by selective breeding it is estimated that  of all livestockrelated fatalities in canada are a result of bull attacks and fewer than one in twenty victims of a bull attack survives dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers in some parts of the united states the need to move a bull in and out of its pen to cover cows exposes the handler to serious jeopardy of life and limb being trampled jammed against a wall or gored by a bull was one of the most frequent causes of death in the dairy industry before  as suggested in one popular farming magazine handle the bull with a staff and take no chances the gentle bull not the vicious one most often kills or maims his keeper handlingedit a bull with a nose ring tethered to a picket it is traditional in many areas to place rings in bulls noses to help control them the ring is usually made of copper and is inserted through a small hole cut in the septum of the nose it is used by attaching a lead rope either directly to it or running through it from a head collar or for more difficult bulls a bull pole or bull staff may be used this is a rigid pole about  metre  ft long with a clip at one end this attaches to the ring and allows the bull both to be led and to be held away from his handler an aggressive bull may be kept confined in a bull pen a robustlyconstructed shelter and pen often with an arrangement to allow the bull to be fed without entering the pen if an aggressive bull is allowed to graze outside additional precautions may be needed to help avoid his harming people one method is a bull mask which either covers the bulls eyes completely or restricts his vision to the ground immediately in front of him so he cannot see his potential victim another method is to attach a length of chain to the bulls nosering so that if he ducks his head to charge he steps on the chain and is brought up short alternatively the bull may be hobbled or chained by his ring or by a collar to a solid object such as a ring concreted into the ground in larger pastures particularly where a bull is kept with other cattle the animals may simply be fed from a pickup truck or tractor the vehicle itself providing some protection for the humans involved generally bulls kept with cows tend to be less aggressive than those kept alone in herd situations cows with young calves are often more dangerous to humans in the off season multiple bulls may be kept together in a bachelor herd artificial inseminationedit bullfighting see also frozen bovine semen many cattle ranches and stations run bulls with cows and most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one if not several bulls for purposes of herd maintenance however the problems associated with handling a bull particularly where cows must be removed from its presence to be worked has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination ai of the cows semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen where it is kept until it can be sold at which time it can be very profitable in fact many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose ai is also used to increase the quality of a herd or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines some ranchers prefer to use ai to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright ai may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds usesedit a bull used in heraldry coat of arms of mecklenburg region germany an aurochs bull in a cave painting in lascaux france aside from their reproductive duties bulls are also used in certain sports including bullfighting and bull riding they are also incorporated into festivals and folk events such as the running of the bulls and were seen in ancient sports such as bullleaping though less common than castrated males bulls are used as draught oxen in some areas the oncepopular sport of bullbaiting in which a bull is attacked by specially bred and trained dogs which came to be known as bulldogs was banned in england by the cruelty to animals act  significance in human cultureedit bulls have held a place of significance in human culture since before the beginning of recorded history they appear in cave paintings estimated to be up to  years old the mythic bull of the heavens plays a role in the ancient sumerian epic of gilgamesh dating as far back as  bc the importance of the bull is reflected in its appearance in the zodiac as taurus and its numerous appearances in mythology where it is often associated with fertility see also korban in hinduism a bull named nandi usually depicted seated is worshipped as the vehicle of the god shiva and depicted on many of the images of that god symbolically the bull appears commonly in heraldry and in modern times as a mascot for both amateur and professional sports teams see alsoedit cowcalf operation referencesedit  delbridge a et al macquarie dictionary the book printer australia   sheena coupe ed

and medium size private chinese companies is becoming very aggressive many of our competitors have certain advantages over us such as · greater financial resources · much longer operating history · stronger name recognition and · superior marketing resources we may not be able to compete successfully against such established competitors also new competitors will consistently enter our market because of the lower entrance barrier competitive pressures may also force us to lower our service prices any price reduction could reduce our revenues and profitability we do not provide legal advice nor do we act as an investment advisor we are not registered as a broker dealer in addition there are law firms and investment that are presently organizing business services designed for the chinese marketplace this could negatively affect our ability to secure customers any inability to secure or maintain customers would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and realize profits to compete successfully we plan to market our services to a small and select group of china companies specifically those being attracted to our reduced service fees or our acceptance of their stock as our compensation further from the initiation of the proposal of the project we will build a trust relation with our clients in china it is important to build trust first before you want the payment sometimes people will select the trust relation rather than the brand name in picking up the financial consultants as andrew chien has worked in this area since  he already built some trust relations with some local chinese financial consultants which will help him to get customers we believe that once the client has worked with us because of our personalized service and lower fees he will likely become a repeat customer and may also refer other companies to us company description china bull management inc was incorporated in the state of nevada on december   for the purpose to engage in the
