involved in any legal action or proceedings since becoming incorporated has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets nor has it been involved in any mergers acquisitions or consolidations sigmabroadband co is not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in rule a of regulation c of the securities act of  since it has a specific business plan purpose and substantial assets   since our inception we have been engaged in business planning activities including researching the industry identifying target markets for our services and developing our sigmabroadband co models and financial forecasts performing due diligence regarding potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for establishing our offices and identifying future sources of capital   currently sigmabroadband co has officers and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning development and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages of the

 million americans do not have broadband at home today and most of them are living in rural communities across america we intend to be a leading provider of costeffective and reliable technology services for home small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve and to create value to our shareholders   we intend to deliver innovative communications information and entertainment our

presence in the tripleplay broadband cable and telecom industry in america   plan of operation   we are a development stage company incorporated on october   and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations however we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve  months our auditors’ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations the opinion results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than operations our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company table of contents        our officers and directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when these controls are implemented they will be responsible for the administration of the controls should they not have sufficient experience they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the securities and exchange commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment   since incorporation the company has financed its operations originally through private capital and then loans from stockholders and executives of the company as of june   we had  cash on hand  we had total expenses of  which were related to general and administrative costs see “financial statements”   to date the company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic business plan sigmabroadband co is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued operations     our intended plan of operations is to offer voice data and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue if sigmabroadband co does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next  months the company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern there are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that if needed sufficient financing can be obtained or if obtained that it will be on reasonable terms without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety   sigmabroadband co currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary capital for its business     our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve  months as needed currently the company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time   the company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors  additionally sigmabroadband co believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next twelve months   the company has no plans to seek a business combination with another entity in the foreseeable future   impact of inflation   we believe that the rate of inflation has had negligible effect on us  we believe we can absorb most if not all increased noncontrolled operating costs by operating our company in the most efficient manner possible   results of operations   we have generated no significant revenues since inception we have incurred operational expenses for the six months ended june   and  in the amounts of  and  respectively these expenses were attributed to continuing startup costs including general and administrative expenses   general trends and outlook   we believe that our immediate outlook is extremely favorable as we believe the competition is very limited in our market niche for broadband voice data and video in the rural markets and only a limited number of companies competing with us in the marketplace however there is no assurance that such national competitor will not arrive in the future we do not anticipate any major changes in the tripleplay telecommunications industry we believe that  and beyond will be a significant growth years for us as we gain strength and stability in the regional rural markets we intend to expand our influence in markets throughout the us table of contents        liquidity and capital resources   the financial statements have been prepared assuming the company

contents        plan of operation   we are a development stage company incorporated on october   and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations however we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve  months our auditors’ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations the opinion results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than operations our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company   our officers and directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when these controls are implemented they will be responsible for the administration of the controls should they not have sufficient experience they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the securities and exchange commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment   since incorporation the company has financed its operations originally through private capital and then loans from stockholders and executives of the company as of march   we had  cash on hand  we had total expenses of  which were related to general and administrative costs see “financial statements”   to date the company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic business plan sigmabroadband co is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued operations     our intended plan of operations is to offer voice data and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue if sigmabroadband co does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next  months the company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern there are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that if needed sufficient financing can be obtained or if obtained that it will be on reasonable terms without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety   sigmabroadband co currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary capital for its business     our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve  months as needed currently the company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time   the company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors  additionally sigmabroadband co believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next twelve months   the company has no plans to seek a business combination with another entity in the foreseeable future   impact of inflation   we believe that the

of  and  respectively these expenses were attributed to continuing startup costs including general and administrative expenses the decrease in  depreciation and the increase of  in expenses offset the operational expenses   general trends and outlook   we believe that our immediate outlook is extremely favorable as we believe the competition is very limited in our market niche for broadband voice data and video in the rural markets and only a limited number of companies competing with us in the marketplace however there is no assurance that such national competitor will not arrive in the future we do not anticipate any major changes in the tripleplay telecommunications industry we believe that  and beyond will be a significant growth years for us as we gain strength and stability in

timely basis the reasons described in reasonable detail here in this annual report form k could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense   part i   item  business background sigmabroadband co is a registered georgia company the company has certain technology assets which had been fully impaired as of december   the company is to be engaged in the business of providing voice data and digital video as a triple play bundled service to rural markets in the united states of america we plan to offer our customers traditional cable video programming internet services telephone services and iptv as well as advanced video services such as on demand high definition “hd” television and digital video recorder “dvr” service we plan to provide national and international long distance service our business plan include goals for increasing customers and revenue to reach our goals we will actively invest in our network and operations in order to improve the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer   sigmabroadband co has never declared bankruptcy it has never been in receivership and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings since becoming incorporated has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets nor has it been involved in any mergers acquisitions or consolidations sigmabroadband co is not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in rule a of regulation c of the securities act of  since it has a specific business plan purpose and substantial assets   since our inception we have been engaged in business planning activities including researching the industry identifying target markets for our services and developing our sigmabroadband co models and financial forecasts performing due diligence regarding potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for establishing our offices and identifying future sources of capital   currently sigmabroadband co has officers and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning development and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages of the company other than the officersdirectors and other management team there are no employees at the present time we do anticipate hiring regular employees when the need arises   sigmabroadband co is currently is engaged in talks with several other companies for a possible merger or acquisition also we may pursue other strategic acquisitions that complement our current business model within the technology industry which may allow us to expand our activities capabilities advance our production and revenue   sigmabroadband co’s fiscal year end is december           industry background   approximately  million americans do not have broadband at home today and most of them are living in rural communities across america we intend to be a leading provider of costeffective and reliable technology services for home small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve and to create value to our shareholders   we intend to deliver innovative communications information and entertainment our voice data and video products and services offer over intelligent wireless wireline cable fiber broadband and global ip networks that meet customers growing demand for speed mobility security and control as a committed corporate citizen we use our advanced communications services to address important issues confronting our society today especially in rural america we plan to follow a strategy of being first to our regional markets with technology and services first introduced in metropolitan areas by national service providers   we intend to be a full service facilitiesbased cable operator local exchange and interexchange carrier serving both residential and commercial customers by providing voice data and digital video services we intend to employ the newest technology available in the marketplace today which provides quality of service qos reliability security redundancy and continuity of service always in the future we will be recognized as a leader in the data network ip telephony and cloudbased services our potential customers are located in some of the country’s largest cities to families living in rural communities we intend to establish a dominant national presence in the tripleplay broadband cable and telecom industry in america   plan of operation   we are a development stage company incorporated on october   and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations however we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve  months our auditors‟ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations the opinion results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than operations our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company   our officers and directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when these controls are implemented they will be responsible for the administration of the controls should they not have sufficient experience they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the securities and exchange commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment   since incorporation the company has financed its operations originally through private capital and then loans from stockholders and executives of the company as of december   we had  cash on hand we had totaled operating expenses of  which were related to general and administrative costs see “financial statements”   to date the company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic business plan sigmabroadband co is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued operations   our intended plan of operations is to offer voice data and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue if sigmabroadband co does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next  months the company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern there are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that if needed sufficient financing can be obtained or if obtained that it will be on reasonable terms without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety   sigmabroadband co currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary capital for its business   our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve  months as needed currently the company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time          the company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors additionally sigmabroadband co believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next twelve months   the company is plans to seek a business combination with another entity in the foreseeable future under the right circumstances   our mission   to be a leading provider of costeffective and reliable technology services for home small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve and to create value to our shareholders our vision   to be a force in the technology industry that will transform the way of life in our communities   our commitment to customers   to provide optimum support and service using stateoftheart technology and innovative customer care building long standing partnerships with our customers ensuing mutually beneficial returns   the market   fcc broadband report synopsis as per the us federal government broadband is the great infrastructure challenge of the early st century like electricity a century ago broadband is a foundation for economic growth job creation global competitiveness and a better way of life it is enabling entire new industries and unlocking vast new possibilities for existing ones it is changing how we educate children deliver health care manage energy ensure public safety engage government and access organize and disseminate knowledge   but broadband in america is not all where it needs to be according to the fcc broadband report synopsis a pproximately  million   americans do not have broadband at home  broadbandenabled health information technology it can improve care and lower costs by hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming decades yet the united states is behind many advanced countries in the adoption of such technology broadband can provide teachers with tools that allow students to learn the same course material in half the time but there is a dearth of easily accessible digital educational content required for such opportunities a broadbandenabled smart grid could increase energy independence and efficiency but much of the data required to capture these benefits are inaccessible to consumers businesses and entrepreneurs and nearly a decade after  our first responders still lack a nationwide public safety mobile broadband communications network even though such a network could improve emergency response and homeland security   sigmabroadband co was created to take advantage of the market demand for communications and entertainment bundled services priced within the reach of all consumers we are deploying voice data digital video and other broadband related services to rural america we are positioned to provide services to  homes in arizona and another  homes in missouri we plan to extend the missouri network to another  homes bringing the total in our franchised area to  our intended  per month tripleplay service standard package of voice data and digital video will provide a compelling offer that will attract many new subscribers and be a competitive advantage going forward none of our known competitors have such an offer and if they choose to follow they will erode their existing revenue base   market pricing strategy   our key market pricing strategy is to bundle our services to provide a more price competitive package to the customers  the all inclusive and flat rate billing we promote allow customers to plan for and budget a fixed price for all their monthly telecommunication services this billing strategy sets us apart from all of our existing competitors we intend to provide optimum support and service using stateoftheart technology and innovative customer care building longstanding partnerships with our customers ensuing mutually beneficial returns          services and product   our technology allows us to provide broadband tripleplay services to any market nationwide our core business objective is to offer a bundling of services to include telephone service internet access cellular and cable television nationwide and also providing cloud based and iptv services the bundled service or t triple play will be made available to the public at a prepaid fixed cost of  permonth with no taxes no contract no deposit and no credit needed to the low income families retirees unserved underserved underprivileged and rural communities in order to help bridge the technology usage gap in these areas the potential customer base is extensive as it literally consists of businesses residential and rural customers throughout the  of the us covered by our network infrastructure   competition   across the united states multiple systems operators msos compete with direct broadcast satellite dbs providers and incumbent telecom companies we believe that we compete with other providers in three product categories video voice and data   we are poised to compete with any competitor that enters our market in terms of price quality of service and no term contract since our operations are in rural areas we may not have to compete with any regional and national carriers except for local independent operators and dbs providers   market strategy  rural vs urban markets   in rural markets cable and dbs are often the only providers of video services recently cable companies have been losing video share to dbs primarily due to the fact that dbs has a greater number of highdefinition channels and provides better customer service we are trying to make up ground by pushing bundled services to customers hsd and telephony the current trend of rbocs providing fttn or fttp will mostly affect competitive dynamics in urban markets not in rural markets as the high amount of capex being spent can only be justified in areas with high density   we will be the only major triple play service provider in all of our rural markets where our cablehubs infrastructure will be located at present time the competitive dynamics between rbocs and cable msos in rural areas where fttn and fttp are not available favors cable we will continue to have a competitive advantage in high speed data voice and digital video traditional rboc services generally do not include video which will allow us a large bundling advantage wireless substitution is most likely to continue though the rate of substitution will be less in rural areas where users are more likely to keep wireline phones because of cellular signal issues we believe that cable msos like sigmabroadband co operating primarily in rural markets will face more favorable competitive dynamics than those in urban markets   our triple play price strategy and differences   we set ourselves apart from the competition not only by providing a superb customer care and quality of service but also offers our customers a flat rate service at month including all applicable taxes and without any term contract ever for the exact same services that the competition may provide in areas we serve   operating strategy   sigmabroadband co offers a quality consumer experience at a reasonable price for entertainment communications and all broadband services we intend to always value our customer’s needs and their requests while balancing the requirement to meet our financial responsibility our focus will be greater than customer service it will be on serving the customer and our strategic assets   our key to success is to bring the strength of our business development experiences well trained personnel and cuttingedge technologies in every segment of our core businesses to increase profit margin and increase investors‟ satisfaction while we deliver value from diversity and promote sustainability for economic and social development   regulation challenges   there are multiple and intense regulatory battles over tripleplay services as incumbent telephone companies and incumbent cable operators attempt to keep out new competitors  since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies regulatory capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service cable providers want to compete with telephone companies for local voice service but want to discourage telephone companies from competing with them for television service incumbent telephone companies want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators both industries cloak their demands for favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor the public interests          business challenges   the challenges in offering tripleplay are mostly associated with determining the right business model backend processes customer care support and economic environment rather than technology for example using the right billing platform to address a variety of subscriber demographics or having the appropriate subscriber density to financially justify introduction of the service are a few factors that affect decisions to offer tripleplay services   in addition to the challenges mentioned above there are a number of technical challenges with regards to the rollout of triple play services broadband voice digital video and high speed data all have different characteristics and place different burdens on the network that provides access to these services voice services are greatly affected by jitter whereas packet loss has a greater effect on digital video and data services in order to use a shared network resource such as cable or dsl we may use network equipment that employs qualityofservice mechanisms to adjust to the requirements of the different services   sigmabroadband co creates a bridge between local exchange carrier and cable service provider all into one network and from one provider which in turns help reduce the customer’s cost better quality of service and best customer service experience   the other challenge for us is to provide superior service at a price value point that will attract customers away from existing telecom and cable operators in areas where we compete we are confident that we will be very competitive with our multiple channels of basic video a minimum d mbps internet connection together with an unlimited localdomestic long distance package all for  per month and no other hidden cost to the customer in one network will attract many customers to our company   our financial forecasts reflect a rigorous marketing approach that takes advantage of being the newest broadband tripleplay provider in the market we serve this will create a baseline for a significant marketing program should we reach the top of the interest curve   our technology   we intend to operate class  voice switching routers digital multiplexers among others and a cable network which allowing us to lower the cost of ip and tdm voice termination to our customers to date we have access from  headend locations capable of serving well over  rural counties and communities the current network without expansion spans  linear miles covering more than  square miles utilizing  miles of fiber optic cable or  million feet of fiber infrastructure   employees   sigmabroadband co with the exception of its officers and directors has no other employees however works with several outside consultants who have substantial industry experience and who have dedicated time and effort on behalf of the company   the company may be required to hire an attorney on a consultancy basis to navigate permit and licensing requirements but otherwise sigmabroadband co‟s officers and directors intend to do whatever work is necessary to bring the company to the point of earning revenues from the sale of our services or further acquisitions all operational functions such as customer service representatives telemarketing warehousing and fulfillment are planned to be outsourced human resource planning will be part of an ongoing process that will include constant evaluation of operations and revenue

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements see the “liquidity and capital resources” section under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this item of this report and the other risks and uncertainties that are set forth elsewhere in this report or detailed in our other securities and exchange commission reports and filings we believe it is important to communicate our expectations however our management disclaims any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise   general overview   we are a development stage company incorporated on october   and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations   we intend to engage in the business of providing voice data and digital video services as a triple play bundled service to rural markets in the united states of america   since our inception we have been engaged in business planning activities including researching the industry identifying target markets for our services and developing our sigmabroadband co models and financial forecasts performing due diligence regarding potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for establishing our offices and identifying future sources of capital   currently sigmabroadband co has officers and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning development and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages of the company other than the officersdirectors there are no employees at the present time we do anticipate hiring employees when the need arises   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve  months our auditors‟ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations the opinion results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than operations our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company          results of operations   our officers and directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when these controls are implemented they will be responsible for the administration of the controls should they not have sufficient experience they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the securities and exchange commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment   since incorporation the company has financed its operations through private placement capital as of december   we had  cash on hand for the years ended december   and  we had total operating expenses of  and  respectively which were related to general and administrative costs see “financial statements”   to date the company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic business plan sigmabroadband co is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued operations   our intended plan of operations is offer voice data and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue if sigmabroadband co does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next  months the company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern there are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that if needed sufficient financing can be obtained or if obtained that it will be on reasonable terms without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety     sigmabroadband co currently does own significant plant or equipment that it may seek to sell in the near future   our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve  months as needed currently the company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time   the company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors additionally sigmabroadband co believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next twelve

accounting principles applied on a consistent basis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements in general managements estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates   intangible assets   there were

not currently have the funding to fully implement its business plan future losses are anticipated in the continued development of its business raising substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its

loans from directors or stockholders or through debt or equity financings   the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
