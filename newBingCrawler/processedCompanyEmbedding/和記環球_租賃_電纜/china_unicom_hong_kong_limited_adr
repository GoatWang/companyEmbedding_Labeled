from china’s economic slowdown  etf daily news  part  how to profit from china’s economic slowdown china mobile ltd adr china unicom hong kong limited adr march   pm etf basic news moe zulfiqar there’s a significant amount of pessimism towards the chinese economy these days and the reasons behind this are very understandable the economic data suggests the country is headed toward an economic slowdown in  china’s gross domestic product gdp grew by —barely better than the previous year and the estimates that were calling for the lowest growth rate since  source yao k and wang a “china’s  economic growth dodges year low but further slowing seen” reuters january   keep in mind that despite beating the estimates this gdp growth rate is much lower than the country’s historical average this isn’t all a credit crunch is also in the making we are now hearing how companies in china will have troubles paying their interest on the bonds they have issued so far we have seen one default on payment by shanghai chaori solar energy science  technology co this solar company based in china defaulted on a million interest payment on bonds it issued two years ago source wei l mcmahon d and ma w “chinese firm’s bond default may not be the last” the wall street journal march   before this default there was a slight hope that the government would come in and bail out the troubled companies—something that happened in the us economy during the financial crisis in  now with this default there are speculations that we will see more of the same furthermore there are concerns that property values in the chinese economy are going to see a correction over the past few years there has been the mass development of ghost towns—these are cities that have been built with massive infrastructure yet very few people are living there it shows there’s a massive amount of supply in the property market—which of course results in lower prices in addition to all this production in the country is declining in february the indicators of manufacturing activity in china like the hsbc china manufacturing purchasing mangers’ index declined to an eightmonth low showing there’s an outright contraction in the sector source “hsbc china manufacturing pmi pmi signals modest deterioration of business conditions in february” markit march   in spite of the negativity towards china in the mainstream i remain bullish on the country and believe investors may do very well there let me explain… certainly there are troubles that will come in the way in the near future but the longterm perspective looks good many investors forget that china has the biggest population in the world and the middle class in the country continues to grow the recent troubles according to my analysis will create havoc in chinese stocks in the short term but they will also create buying opportunities in the wellknown names that have massive market share take china mobile limited nysechl for example since the third quarter of  the company’s stock price has declined roughly  recently the stock broke below its longterm support level and it may go down further china mobile has more than  million subscribers to put this into perspective that’s more than twice the size of the american population as more economic news comes out of china investors should make a list of major companies that operate in china and trade on the key stock indices here in the us when there’s a selloff certain companies get punished for no apparent reason—and that’s when they are worth buying chinese companies will be no different this article is brought to you courtesy of moe zulfiqar from the daily gains letter read next no related posts get free updates join over  investors who get the latest
