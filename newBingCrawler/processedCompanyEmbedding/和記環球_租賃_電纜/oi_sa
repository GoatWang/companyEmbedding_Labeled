and breton un one as a numberedit one sometimes referred to as unity is the first nonzero natural number it is thus the integer before two and after zero and the first positive odd number any number multiplied by one remains that number as one is the identity for multiplication as a result  is its own factorial its own square its own cube and so on one is also the result of the empty product as any number multiplied by one is itself it is also the only natural number that is neither composite nor prime with respect to division but instead considered a unit as a digitedit the glyph used today in the western world to represent the number  a vertical line often with a serif at the top and sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom traces its roots back to the indians who wrote  as a horizontal line much like the chinese character  the gupta wrote it as a curved line and the nagari sometimes added a small circle on the left rotated a quarter turn to the right this lookalike became the present day numeral  in the gujarati and punjabi scripts the nepali also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small this eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the roman numeral i in some countries the little serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke sometimes as long as the vertical line which can lead to confusion with the glyph for seven in other countries where the  is written with a long upstroke the number  has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line while the shape of the  character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually is of xheight as for example in  the hour tower clock

the maximum possible value in the range of parameters likewise vectors are often normalized to give unit vectors that is vectors of magnitude one because these often have more desirable properties functions too are often normalized by the condition that they have integral one maximum value one or square integral one depending on the application because of the multiplicative identity if fx is a multiplicative function then f must equal  it is also the first and second number in the fibonacci sequence  is the zeroth and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences  is neither a prime number nor a composite number but a unit like − and in the gaussian integers i and −i the fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees unique factorization over the integers only up to units for example    but if units are included is also equal to say − ×  ×  among infinitely many similar factorizations the definition of a field requires that  must not be equal to  thus there are no fields of characteristic  nevertheless abstract algebra can consider the field with one element which is not a singleton and is not a set at all  is the only positive integer divisible by exactly one positive integer whereas prime numbers are divisible by exactly two positive integers composite numbers are divisible by more than two positive integers and zero is divisible by all positive integers
