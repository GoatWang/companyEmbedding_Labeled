laithe star petaling jaya sedania innovator bhd’s sib recent proposed acquisition of sedania as salam capital sasc for rmmil is a leap into the fintech sector as the company believes in its potential growth in the islamic banking space the technology company’s rational for the acquisition seems rather clear sasc provides the assidq system and is currently utilised by  financial services companies in malaysia while founder and managing director datuk azrin mohd noor believed the proposed acquisition will obtain shareholders’ approval he said valuation wise sasc should be worth much more than the  times forward pricetoearnings pe since it is already profitable and offer high margins “but given the potential complications that might derail the deal it was agreed that the deal be sealed at  times” he explained since its inception in  sasc has been providing the assidq which is a tawarruq commodity trading system that utilises prepaid telecommunication airtime credit as the traded commodity based on syariah principles the system also complies with the international standards set by the accounting and auditing organisation for islamic financial institutions aaoifi based in bahrain aaoifi consists of about  country members with assidq azrin said buying and selling of commodities using tawarruq islamicbased finance disbursement allowed customers to receive their money in less than  hours “the solution automates buying and selling of mobile prepaid airtime as the commodity used in the transactions between the customer the bank the commodity supplier and the buyer “in this case the customer is purchasing the commodity as the underlying asset from the bank the commodity or asset is then sold for cash to a party other than the original seller” he said the system has processed about rmbil worth of personal financing transactions under islamic banking to date islamic banking’s personal finance is projected to have a market size of rmbil in  on feb  sib inked a share sale agreement with sedania corp sdn bhd sedaniacorp to buy sasc for rmmil the purchase consideration will be satisfied via rmmil cash and rmmil via the issuance of  million new ordinary sib shares at an issue price of  sen per share according to sib’s filings the issue price of  sen per share represents a premium of rm or  after taking into consideration of the fiveday volume weighted average market price of sib shares up to feb  close of rm being the last market day before the share sale agreement the rmmil cash payment would be staggered over three tranches namely rmmil in the first tranche and rmmil in the subsequent two tranches upon fulfilment of profit guarantee sasc will provide a profit guarantee of rmmil per year for the financial years ending december   fy and fy the deal was sealed at  times forward pricetoearnings pe to enable sib derive the best benefits from its future growth sasc is owned by sedaniacorp where azrin holds a majority stake of  making this a related party transaction the remaining shares are owned by azrin’s spouse datin noraida saludin “the assidq system is already present in  financial institutions and access to  cooperatives in the country “sasc’s acquisition will not only boost customers’ confidence in its product offering but it will also create value for our shareholders” said the yearold law graduate sasc posted a net profit of rmmil and revenue of rmmil in fy from a net profit of rm and revenue of rmmil a year ago this was due to higher transaction volume as more personal financing applications were approved by financial services companies as well as the offering of a new product in fixed deposit in the year “it will be a significant contributor to our financials which more than offset the dilution effect from the increase in share base” he noted he added that the proposed acquisition is expected to increase sib’s share capital from rmmil in fy to rmmil in fy azrin believed the acquisition would be worthwhile since there are other untapped segments that sib could penetrate via the assidq system such as hire purchase mortgage credit card and deposits mortgage offers the highest utilisation rate of rmbil by  followed by hire purchase at rmbil “the potential is huge in the islamic banking space due to the growing awareness of syariahcompliant products among muslims as well as those seeking personal
