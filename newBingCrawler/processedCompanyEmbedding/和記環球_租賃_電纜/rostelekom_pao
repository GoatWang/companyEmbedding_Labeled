president strategy and media so the order of todays conference call will be the same as usual so well have a short presentation from our speakers and then followed by qabefore we begin let me remind you of our disclaimer statements any information provided during this call may contain projections and other forwardlooking statements while we believe that these projections are reasonable and are based on our current trends market and industry trends we wish to caution you that actual results can differ materially from these projections we have no intention to update these projections or reflect the occurrence of unexpected events so now we are ready to begin and sergey please go aheadsergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language good evening dear colleagues spoken in foreign language as you will appreciate we want to update our results for the third quarter  spoken in foreign language and the information were about to share well at least we feel sort of  moderately optimistic about it and hopefully you will feel the same once we share the results with you spoken in foreign language its good to mention that as usual we continued to increase the number of users of our pay tv our broadband internet and also were finishing building the optic fiber network in the areas where we didnt have it yet spoken in foreign language and this good growth of new products and services brought about some very good financial resultsspoken in foreign language our revenues grew by  spoken in foreign language we have great ebitda and ebitda margin similar to what we had a year ago spoken in foreign language we inaudible that we were able to almost double our net profit yearonyear which is good news spoken in foreign language but importantly the numbers that ive just shared demonstrate that the digital transformation that we have started a while ago is now bringing results that we like spoken in foreign language for example in cloud services and product we grew by more than  spoken in foreign language thats what helped us compensate the lost revenue that we didnt receive because of the budget cuts that resulted in lower payments under the bdd project spoken in foreign language im also pleased to say that the projects that have been started just recently for example the rostelecoms production system are also using some very good results already spoken in foreign language for example in novosibirsk obvious where we piloted it productivity grew by  and profitability grew by  spoken in foreign language we also see the positive performance of nps or net promoter score we also see the reduction in the financial markets we can see that the reduction is by several clients spoken in foreign language i would also like to mention that the company has adopted an new longterm incentive program that will be in operation in   and  spoken in foreign language it is very much different from the previous programread morespoken in foreign language we believe that the new program is similar to what it companies or engineering technology companies would have spoken in foreign language importantly almost any employee can become part of the program spoken in foreign language and an important principle is that employees will totally invest together with the company spoken in foreign language so that we have that share matching plan which is part of the program and importantly the people such as programmers system architects and engineers will be getting more share from the company as a result of their coinvesting efforts than others so in that way we will stimulate the most productive the most technologically intensive and the most creative people and professions spoken in foreign language i also like to mention that as part of this program people who are responsible for developing the production system as well as cutting cost are also entitled for having opportunities to get more shares from the company than perhaps some other people spoken in foreign language i would also like to mention that we have launched a fullfledged mvno almost across the whole of russia spoken in foreign language and currently we see that our initial ambition to have  of penetration into our client base through basically mobile coverage seems to be quite reasonable spoken in foreign language and it is perhaps a bit early to talk about that but just on the preliminary data we see that this sort of cozy and full play offering indeed helps reduce customer churn spoken in foreign language including in fixed telephony and thats basically all i wanted to sayand with that i am happy to turn it over to vladimirvladimir kirienko rostelecom pjsc  svp for business development and operations thank you very much sergey hello to everyone who is on the line today i am delighted to have joined by an experienced and professional management team we have a bright future ahead of us and i am looking forward to contribute to it as you know i am a recent joiner and i have full intent to draw on my background in banking and inaudible industries to make this role a success im responsible for the management of two key business area commercial activity as well as system stability for the regional branches and the direction of the companys new business development i have not been here long but i can already tell you that the management has made a significant progress in management of the companys strategy defending its traditional voice business and branching out into the new market with high growth potential however it has still a lot to dofirst and foremost we need to improve our new product development procedures you can see from our results that for the last two quarters where valueadded services and clouds has been the largest contributor to the topline growth this can be further accelerated by intensifying product development and ensuring products are marketed effectively so we got the most out of the unit growth scenario such as data centers cloud computers big data industrial internet of things artificial intelligence geodata and otherssecondly our blended arpu can be increased by setting our customer base to digital and content service we need to promote the core service of pay tv and broadband more aggressively by intensive customer care and coming up with more tailored packages for customers to increase value for money and custom satisfaction these are key goals for the coming year and my main area of systems stability lets come back to the results if you look on to the operational results we demonstrated the third quarter of  was a successful both in terms of penetration of our digital business and in terms of operational highlights the most prominent event of the third quarter was the commercial launch of mvno with telenow we can deliver quadrupleplay solution across the country which is truly promising and unmatched service given our national wide scale of our operations as of today mvno has been launched in  out of  regions and more importantly for us we finally got a presence in moscow market and i think its really a great win for us this is a key driver that can help us grow our topline especially in bb and bg segments another fuel of our success in the third quarter was video surveillance for the parliamentary elections held in september this vast project was successfully executed under the regional contract of rub millionrostelecom once again proved its worth as a reliable and safe partner in realizing ambition complex and largescale projects we hope this will go a long way to strengthen our status to the partner for the government we had a number of other important government contracts in bb and bg space that supported our revenue including contracts with justice department smart city projects and others on the bc side we can keep promoting attractive proposition to our plans to stimulate consumption in videoondemand and other high growth services which resulted in higher subscriber base and increased revenue all this translated into a growth across all of our key operation indicators growth in number of broadband customers reached  or  million inaudible while the iptv space grew by  to  million customers most importantly for us in terms of revenue content and digital service grew at a pace of cloud and valueadded services posted a substantial growth of  as a result the share of digital and content services increased to  as well in the third quarter of  from  in the same period last year this is in line with our strategic goal of becoming a digital service provider by delivering an increasing portion of services such as pay tv broadband cloud industrial internet of things and others and we are happy that we are on track to reach this targetthis is all from my side i would like to hand over to our cfo kaiuwekaiuwe mehlhorn rostelecom pjsc  svp cfo thank you very much vladimir good evening ladies and gentlemen on my side first of all presenting today financial and operational results i would like to confirm that we are happy content with the growth of the results that is very important we see that the initiatives taken by the management in face of revenue is growing yearonyear despite the fact that normal spending the decrease in fixed line revenue which is not an issue which is not easy to compensate nevertheless we have been able to do that and the result has showed that in our financial positionoibda margin and oibda in absolute terms is stable and resilient despite tough competition and also inflation in russia there are however reasons for being conservative due to the difficult macroeconomic environment and there is a significant risk that the state reimbursement for the bdd project bridging the digital divide will be reduced in  based on this we will slightly review our guidance and i will come back to this later on during my presentations lets take a more detailed look into the financial results starting with revenueas already said revenue is up yearonyear by  and we reached rub billion in quarter three and also revenue is up compared to last quarter by rub billion we also believe that we will traditionally show strong revenue quarter four and we are heavily working on that in spite of our homerun initiative for the company as already stated we reached rub billion in oibda which is equal to  in margin which is solid resilient based on results take into consideration the environment this is slightly above our expectation we had coming from last quarter in terms of capex investment holdings we are continuing to fulfill important projects capex cash is coming back to normal so we had discussion up to half year results and i explained that we will have seasonal effect during the year and effectively this is happening so capex implied for the q was lower than the previous quarter so we invested rub billion including bdd project and if you take this together up to nine months we have a ratio of  excluding bdd i will come back to it later on when we talk about profit for the total yeari would also like to mention that we have had a very strong quarter in terms of net income net income we reached rub billion and i think its important to say that that was the strongest quarter since five to six quarters in a row which we are also confident that we can show good results in terms of net income no matter the external environment i think its also worth to say that this result could be even better however so far we have negative influence on our equity consolidations with tele if you look on the nine months results net income reached rub billion and we are also confident that we will add another one quarter in quarter fourlets look on the next slide in order to achieve this we have no other way than controlling our costs because first of all we have to compensate declining revenue from fixed which is traditionally good margin business and we entered into new products where the life cycle is just starting we believe that we do that so we can see this on this page i will not comment on each and every single item however i would like to state that payroll in quarter three was affected by further headcount optimization and also oneoff payment so we continue to close productivity and based on this we also optimize our headcount at the same time utility cost increased mainly due to higher electricity tariffs and also we have had effects from increase in other operational income mainly related to bdd project which we try to offset by decrease in other operating expenses as much as we couldnext slide free cash flow during quarter three was very strong rub million we could manage we also believe that quarter four will be traditionally a very strong quarter in terms of cash flow this has to do also with improvement in cash collection this has to do with additional strong payments from bb so we are confident that we will also have a strong quarter four in terms of cash flow like we had with last year and the year before the total debt and the net debt during quarter three likely being influenced came from dividend payment which we did during july and august and the combination of very positive free cash flow and the dividend payment influenced slightly increasing debt however the debt ratio remained on  so we are quite confident that this is in good handsalso we are confident with regard to our total debt structure which you can see on the slide important to say that during quarter three we did successfully bond placement so we utilized rub billion bond at  which is for the time being an russia benchmark also note the improving macroeconomic environment fitch and sp upgraded the companys outlook to stable which we are also happy to announce next slide based on this coming back to the outlook we said that we would like to slightly revise our outlook based on the macroeconomic environment and also due to the fact that we expect slightly lower reimbursement from the bdd project so before we stated on a revenue that we believe that we would be revenue growth to be  and  now we slightly believe it will be up to  this is with regard to revenue but we are confident that revenue will grow yearonyear and i think that is in any case good result taking into the environment and also fixed line growth on oibda we forecast midsingledigit decline against  however we also believe that quarter four will be strong in terms of profitability same as quarter three and last but not least regarding capex we raised the rate of our capex projection we will be on the level of  capex sales ratio of slightly below and this is excluding bdd project as we stated before you might ask about how much will bdd in capex around the total year so we believe that it will be around rub billion that includes our insurance projectionthank you very much from my sideekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director thank you very much for kaiuwe thank you very much for the presentation so now we are ready to start our qa session operator instructions so george can we have the first questionquestions and answersoperator operator instructions roman arbuzov ubsroman arbuzov ubs  analyst i have two questions please one is on bdd and another one is on tele so on bdd it obviously remains a key issue for the company could you please share your expectations of bdd revenues for this year and perhaps also next year that will be very useful and then could you also perhaps give us some color in terms of how quickly do you think you can adapt to the new revenue environment when it comes to bdd and do you think you can adapt immediately for example would you think there is a significant time lag between the new sort of spending environment and the cost side and the investment side of the equation thats the first question and then one more in tele please so last quarter you mentioned that you were very happy with the relationship you have with tele youre happy with the project youre executing together and the synergies youre getting out of it so i was just wondering if your thinking has changed at all over the last three months and could you perhaps tell us under what circumstances would you potentially consider taking control of sergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language regarding the bdd project we have so to say our own attitude to that project which is undergoing a change spoken in foreign language we rely on other sources of revenue and you may have seen from our presentation that revenues or proceeds from that project have decreased substantially however they didnt have incremental sort of say on our financial results because we were able to compensate the loss of profit and revenue from that project through other sourcesspoken in foreign language we are very happy that our focus on new product and services in particularly cloud where our growth has improved the business really brings good results obviously we are not amazon but we are moving in that direction spoken in foreign language and if we speak about the budget and thats the area where we have threeyear budgets in this country and this is the length this is the period of the budget which is currently under review in the russian state duma or parliament spoken in foreign language so the numbers are solid in  our proceeds are expected to be rub billion spoken in foreign language rub billion in  spoken in foreign language and rub billion in  spoken in foreign language we currently have a much tighter cost control in that project and we almost do not fast track any construction under this spoken in foreign language so we have much stricter control of what we receive and how we spend it under the project spoken in foreign language now in response to your second questionspoken in foreign language we have said many times that tele is not an easy story so to say spoken in foreign language and youre right recently we have been trying to look for more synergy between ourselves and tele spoken in foreign language for example we have told you today that we have practically completed the launch of full mvno spoken in foreign language and just a couple of words here about how we look at this project how we see it spoken in foreign language we are not just looking to through it increase the loyalty of our subscribers and reduce churn spoken in foreign language we also understand that mvno for us is a vehicle of entry into new markets in which we seek to increase our footprint spoken in foreign language such as for example the mm and iot the internet of things market spoken in foreign language and you are aware that we invest a lot in data centers and new platforms that vladimir has mentioned such as for example geodata and others spoken in foreign language and i hope a day will come if not very soon but quite soon when i will be able to tell you about new products and services that we have building on tele spoken in foreign language that is on one hand spoken in foreign language on the other hand tele is undergoing transformation and they have to become a fullfledged broadband provider spoken in foreign language and we make everything possible so that the activities that we have at rostelecom was available and was used by tele spoken in foreign language and i hope that larisa tkachuk will contribute to that she will be more and more involved with tele going forward spoken in foreign language i apologize if that was too long an answer but i wanted to explain all those to youekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director can we have the next question pleaseoperator igor semenov deutsche bankigor semenov deutsche bank  analyst i have a question on the dividends so i mean so far your free cash flow is negative quite far behind the level of free cash flow generation you had this time last year so i just wanted to double check whether you are committing to an increase in dividend per share for this year and the threeyear target of rub billionsergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language from the numbers that i see spoken in foreign language we see that our cash flow is actually positive and it will continue to grow we expect to see growth in the fourth quarter spoken in foreign language and as a management well do our utmost to implement the dividend policy approved by our board of directors spoken in foreign language and as management well do our utmost to implement the dividend policy after inaudible spoken in foreign language and myself personally i dont see any substantial challenges to that so farigor semenov deutsche bank  analyst can i also followup on the guidance and sort of  ebitda target so this year i suppose its a bit of a first majority that youre losing or not getting rather rub billion of revenues for the bdd project but for next year would you say that ebitda should be more or less in line with the  level in aggregate so around rub billion is that the right way to do it i mean you would scale down the operating expenses or how should i think about thissergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language we believe that it will be premature to be talking about  spoken in foreign language one thing i want to say is that currently we are much more conservative about potential revenues under the bdd project spoken in foreign language and we pay much more attention to some other projects which on the one hand can bring about increase in revenue and net profit and on the other hand reduce costs spoken in foreign language so if nothing certainly happens in russian economy then our results for the next year should be at least as good as for this year but of course its again a bit premature to be talking about that because the budgeting process is still underwayekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director operator can we have the next question pleaseoperator alexander vengranovich otkritie capitalalexander vengranovich otkritie capital  analyst a followup question on your free cash flow and the dividends so just hypothetically if i look at that in q your free cash flow this year is below the amount of dividend payment which you made this year should we expect any contraction of the dividend in  or in other words could you pay more than your  more than  of your annual free cash flow as dividend for the year and what is the minimum youre going to pay by all means as dividend next yearsergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language i would like to rephrase and say once again that in our plans we abide by the dividend policy approved by the board of directors and will make our utmost to implement italexander vengranovich otkritie capital  analyst i just want to clarify that you are fine with paying more than  of your cash flow as dividend so that really  because your dividend policy implies you need to pay more than  of the free cash flow i mean paying more than  isnt fine for yousergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language its possible but looking at the results of the third quarter and from what we see so far in the fourth quarter it seems to me that we should have enough to stay within the boundaries of the dividend policy as far as the free cash flow is concerned that means that we will have enough free cash flow to pay the dividend that we have to under our dividend policyalexander vengranovich otkritie capital  analyst in connection with your answer looking at the free cash flow in the fourth quarter  probable question to kaiuwe how should we look at your working capital in the fourth quarter so seasonally usually you have some release of the working capital due to the reduction of the trade receivables so do you see that all the trends stay pretty much the same as they have in last yearkaiuwe mehlhorn rostelecom pjsc  svp cfo because if we look to last year and to the year before our working capital balance has been always improving in quarter four first of all we especially at the end of the year due to certain asset management cleaning more than  during the year this is one aspect second maybe more important is that we typically get reimbursement and get payment from bb structures partially as well as the bb sector so working capital is hugely very nor has a positive balance in quarter four this is one point second point is also from capex perspective typically we closed quite a number of projects in quarter four however given on the terms of payment payment for those projects is moving into quarter one because a lot of projects are finally closed in novemberdecember based on this if you think in terms of capex cash quarter four is relatively light quarter compared to other quarters so these are the main reasons in terms of seasonality we have seen over the yearend we believe more or less similar things will happen this year we obviously cannot forecast cash flow  because it has to do with cash collection and it does not depend  on us but we will do utmost our best to achieve reasonable similar results than in previous yearsekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director yes thank you operator can we move to the next question pleaseoperator operator instructions dilya ibragimova citigroupdilya ibragimova citigroup  analyst i had a question please on or i have two questions actually first is maybe to larisa if she is in this presentation or maybe some more if you could give us a bit more details on her new role it seems like she has a lot of experience relevant experience to be involved into the team could you perhaps give us a bit more of what the  is she going to be responsible for the marketing or overall management or just a bit more on her new role and second question is on your real estate program there has been i think there definitely has been a sale of real estate so far this year what are your expectation for the fourth quarter and whether there is any macro impact on the release of the real estatesergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language we are setting formulas larisa is not with us here today spoken in foreign language just let me make it clear larisa is not going to work with those two spoken in foreign language we as shareholders have many opportunities to participate in the management of the company through various vehicles through committees and the board of directors spoken in foreign language and also we can meet with the management inaudible as kind of a wish spoken in foreign language so well mostly use these vehiclesspoken in foreign language as to in what specific capacity larisa could be helpful to our joint venture i think you have mentioned just the right things that she could bring to the table spoken in foreign language and i would like to make it clear that we do not want to sort of shadow or second guess the existing tele management spoken in foreign language and we know that there are a lot of respected and efficient people working for tele and in fact new people come on board for example recently inaudible has joined the company he is quite well known in the industry so we would reject ourselves to the instruments available to us as shareholders we do not want to interfere with the tele managementkaiuwe mehlhorn rostelecom pjsc  svp cfo regarding the second question you put on the table in direction of the real estate we believe that we will see especially also in quarter four quite a strong activity from our side in terms of the recent real estate we have quite a lot in the pipeline and this is also why  one reason as to why we are quite positive in terms of cash flow i mean this is one of the reasons we have talked before we have been a little bit less active than previous year during the first half year and there is a good reason for that the market was very volatile and also there was a drop in the pricing so we thought that it will be better to stay less active and put it to later time and i think that was a good decision because we see that slowly slowly the market is kicking off so we can realize lets say sale at advertising terms so answering your question we believe in quarter four we will see stronger activity and stronger impact on our pl respectively thank youekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director george can we have the next question pleaseoperator alexander vengranovich otkritie capitalalexander vengranovich otkritie capital  analyst a followup question sure so my question is on the regulation of interconnect so should we expect any announcements on the changes in the regulation of the interconnect from fixed to mobile and when do you expect them to come to force and what sort of an impact you think it will have on your financialssergey kalugin rostelecom pjsc  president spoken in foreign language thank you for your question spoken in foreign language i think that you as well as us share the inequality that is part of that matter of that issue spoken in foreign language or rather how inaudible it is its difficult for me to make any prediction or forecast about when exactly the regulation will change spoken in foreign language but i have a feeling that most of the topics that are implied on the new legislation have already been agreed spoken in foreign language its difficult for us to speak for the regulator we are trying to be reasonably optimistic about it but its difficult for us to comment about any timingekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director thank you operator do we have any other questionsoperator anna kazaryan vtb capitalanna kazaryan vtb capital  analyst i would like to ask quite short question about taxes we see that there is improvement of tax refunds in the last quarter but still it is smaller than we saw it in the nine months  i would like to ask you do you expect an improvement in the last quarter you still paid more taxes than there were refunds so do you expect higher tax refunds in this year than you had than in the previous year and whether they exceed tax paidvladimir kirienko rostelecom pjsc  svp for business development and operations thank you for your question and first of all i would like to tell you that i have good news why good news because we did tax statement amendment and also the nearly  confirm what we asked to confirm so we have confirmation of additional reimbursement of rub billion to rostelecom most likely according to the schedule issued that is in the next four to six weeks during this year and this is also one of the reasons why we are inaudible confident that we will improve cash position so i just want to answer the question so we will have a similar positive influence than we had last year thank youekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director thank you anna do you have followup question okay operator can we have the next question thenoperator igor goncharov bcsigor goncharov bcs financial group  analyst i have a rather numerical question on the guidance basically take into account that your ebitda for the first nine months declined by  you know that to arrive even to the higher end of your guidance we need to  if i understand we need to see decline in ebitda in the last quarter by more than  if my calculations are correct of course if so what would be the reason for such significant decline in ebitda is there any oneoff items that you expect into your fourth quarter or either any oneoff items in the period for comparison that may lead to a declinekaiuwe mehlhorn rostelecom pjsc  svp cfo first of all we will obviously try to do our best to give a better result i mean there is no reason from our side that we should hide any margin next year and we will not do that so that is statement number one statement number two if you look to the seasonality usually because of marketing activities and other reasons quarter four in terms of oibda margin is usually slightly lower than in other quarters so taking this into account our projection based on the nine months actual figures makes sense however as i said we will do our utmost best to do it as competitively we canigor goncharov bcs financial group  analyst on seasonality i was talking about yearonyear comparison so fourth quarter  to the fourth quarter  so seasonality if i understand should not be a reason for the change however am i wrongkaiuwe mehlhorn rostelecom pjsc  svp cfo we said before that we have information that the bdd contract inaudible other revenue than we had expected and inaudible talked about this this is one of the major reasons why we are looking now more conservativeigor goncharov bcs financial group  analyst in this quarter when the ebitda was down by just  versus last year it didnt happen the underpayment on digital divideekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director igor can you repeat the question pleaseigor goncharov bcs financial group  analyst basically im looking  i understand that this year is going to be weak largely because of the bdd underpayment but the third quarter was relatively strong so im just trying to understand what is different between third quarter and the fourth quarter why third quarter is looking good why this fourth quarter is going to be looking much more than that thats the sort of broad context of my questionkaiuwe mehlhorn rostelecom pjsc  svp cfo there are several reasons reason number one and if you look to the quarterly oibda margin performance in telecom companies theyre different quarterbyquarter so we do not have one line oibda margin and this the mainly reason for this for instance also the bb contract and bg contract they are closed and finished in different quarters giving one example we had this quarter the contract in terms of revenue on the election which is onetime item and we did not have the same contract in quarter four this is one example also we took measures on the bdd lets say cost reduction and all those things are taken into consideration but we believe on the one hand by this we take a conservative view we will try to do an improvement as matter of fact today this projection is stable todayoperator thank you mr goncharov as we have no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to ms ustinova for any additional or closing remarks thank youekaterina ustinova rostelecom pjsc  ir director thank you very much for your questions thank you very much for your attention so we are done for today have a good eveningvladimir kirienko rostelecom pjsc  svp

to its agm the dividend payment for  we believe that the dividend payout for  reflects the companys actual performance in the reporting period we intend to significantly increase the portion of free cash flow that is distributed to our shareholders this reflects our commitment to the key principle of our policy which is to allocate more than three quarters of the free cash flow for dividends and no less than rub  billion within a period of three years without increasing the companys debt burden the proposed level of rub  per share enables us to maintain a high dividend yield generally inline with our current dividend policy kaiuwe mehlhorn senior vicepresident and chief financial officer added the first quarter results reflect the mixed dynamics across our key segments our business is successfully transforming into a leading digital services provider through units that are contributing significantly to our topline at the same time we are experiencing a certain level of decline in our traditional business line as a result lower revenues from interconnect and traffic transit mainly influenced by the strengthening of the rouble prevented us from reporting revenue growth in the first quarter of  nevertheless we have a positive outlook for the economy in  particularly given the growing trend for digitalization across private and public sectors which is opening up new growth prospects for our business we therefore maintain our full year forecast of delivering revenue growth of approximately  and an increase in oibda within  we also expect a capex to revenue ratio of
