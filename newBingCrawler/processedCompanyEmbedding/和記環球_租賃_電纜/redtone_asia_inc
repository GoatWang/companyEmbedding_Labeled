principally involved in the business of offering discounted call services and paperless reload services for prepaid mobile airtime reload for e nd users and corporate segment for end users in shanghai covering all three major telecommunication operators namely china mobile china unicom and china telecom products and services during the period ended april   redtone china offers the following services to customers  discounted call services for consumers ems  discounted call services for corporate customers  reload services for prepaid mobile our venture into the car inspection business with a onestop centre located in taizhou city of the prc has ceased operations due to some unforeseen higher total investment costs competition   the telecommunications industry in china is dominated by three staterun corporations china telecom corporation limited china mobile communications corporation and china united network communications group co ltd all of whom have g licenses and engaged fixedline and mobile business in china  we see competition from i direct telecommunication operators namely china telecom corporation limited china mobile communications corporation and china united network communications group co ltd these companies may adopt a more aggressive pricing on their local and international calls and have direct impact on our discounted call services for corporate segment likewise if these operators offer very competitive rates for domestic long distance and international calls it could pose a substitution threat to our ems services    ii other discounted service providers the discounted service providers such as super esecretary operate domestic calls and the tool to compete is to provide discount on long distance calls this company despite being a small player less than  market share in the shanghai discounted consumer call market may cause the price disruption when they compete on price aggressively iii other mobile airtime reload service providers other competitors like smartpay defeng and yiqiao offers similar mobile airtime reload services in shanghai they entered into this reload services earlier than us but we command slightly better price advantage and better system support for paperless mobile reload in comparison with conventional paperbased reload model   we believe our competitive advantage is derived from the following strengths   a competitive pricing we being one of the leading alternative voice service providers in shanghai in terms of market share could command the economies of scale to achieve lower minutes cost and lower operating cost per minute additional cost advantage is the low capital investment with selfdeveloped technology  by having advantage of longer market presence credibility and dominant market share we can afford to price its products and services competitively while maintaining healthy gross margins   b innovation innovation embodied in all the products and services is the key to the competitive advantage of our operations in addition innovation also helps us to truly serve the needs of the customers and to provide valueadded services and products to the customers    close communication with our front line resellers will enable us to gather market intelligence and assist us in strategy formulation that is relevant to market needs c value added services for the

resources to comply with any governmental regulations applicable to our operations we are subject to the laws and regulations which are generally applicable to business operations such as business licensing requirements income taxes and payroll taxes however the telecommunications industry is highly regulated in china prc laws and regulations will be modified and updated from time to time by the china government in addition many prc laws and regulations are subject to extensive interpretive power of governmental agencies and commissions and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the future interpretation and application of these laws or regulations costs of compliance with environmental laws we are not presently affected by and do not have any costs associated with compliance

based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data     level —valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own
