network operators mvnos particularly in the nofrills and simonly business against this backdrop a telekom austria ag succeeded in safeguarding the premium customer business against new competitors by means of higher handset subsidies and increased data volumes included and bandwidths in the nofrills segment a telekom austria ag was also able to maintain its competitiveness thanks to price adjustments next to increased data volumes includedconvergent product bundles remained a key element of the operating strategy in  in its fixedline business the company also focused increasingly on the development of broadband capacities and services in the year under review with the aim of meeting the rising demand for data against this backdrop a telekom austria ag started to invest even more in the accelerated rollout of the austrian fibre network in  the company plans to spend around eur  mn in total between  and  in addition to regular capital expenditure this plan is subject to the announced government broadband subsidy programme as well as annual budget approvals by the supervisory board in  the rollout concentrated on not subsidised projects as the broadband subsidy programme was not approved until  december  in the year under review a telekom austria ag reported a slight rise in the number of mobile communications customers by  to around  million this was driven by a lower churn rate and higher gross additions nevertheless the market share in mobile communications fell from  in the previous year to  in the year under review the proportion of contract customers dropped from  in the previous year to  in the year under review the number of fixed access lines rose slightly by  lines to nearly  million lines yearonyear fixed broadband and a tv enjoyed considerable yearonyear growth of  and  to more than  million and  customers respectively growth in fixed broadband lines was particularly driven by the increasing demand for the  and  mbps products

negative extraordinary effects in the revenue positions monthly fee and traffic revenues as well as in data and ict solutions there were also positive extraordinary effects in the revenue positions wholesale incl roaming and other revenues in total a negative effect of eur  mn was booked a revenue growth of  could be generated also when adjusted for the extraordinary effects the jump in gross additions in mobile communications as well as lower retention subsidies in combination with a stable number of replaced handsets led to revenue growth from the sale of handsets wholesale revenues also showed growth adjusted for the oneoff effects which is attributable to higher income from satellite solutions and visitor roaming revenues the adjusted decline in monthly fee and traffic revenues and lower interconnection revenue somewhat weakened the overall increase lower revenues from mobile data tariffs and in the nofrills business as well as stable premium customer revenues led overall to lower arpu relevant revenues declining voice minutes continued to negatively impact fixedline revenues but were partly compensated by gains in broadband and tv average monthly revenue per mobile user arpu dropped from eur  to eur  in the year under review this was attributable to a change in the calculation method of arpu as valueadded services were no longer included given the further decline
