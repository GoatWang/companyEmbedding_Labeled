  munawar micki hidayatallah founded and incorporated aly operating inc aly operating formerly aly energy services inc in delaware with the strategic objective of creating an oilfield manufacturing distribution and services company that serves exploration and production companies from well planning to plug and abandonment we intend to grow our business both through organic growth resulting from investment in existing operations and through the acquisition of existing businesses operating in our industry acquisition of austin chalk on october   aly operating acquired all of the stock of austin chalk petroleum services corp austin chalk for a total purchase price of  million total consideration included  million cash net of cash acquired of approximately  a payable of  million and the issuance of  million shares of aly operating redeemable preferred stock  par value at fair value of  million austin chalk was founded in  as a provider of high performance explosionresistant rental

rigup and rigdown of equipment and the hauling of equipment to and from the customers location share exchange on may   aly operating and preferred voice inc preferred voice entered into a share exchange agreement the exchange agreement pursuant to which the holders of common stock of aly operating surrendered all of their shares in exchange for approximately  million newly issued shares of common stock of preferred voice the share exchange representing approximately  of the outstanding common stock of preferred voice after giving effect to the share exchange shares were exchanged at the ratio of  shares of preferred voice common stock for each one share of aly operating common stock immediately after the execution and delivery of the exchange agreement preferred voice amended its certificate of incorporation to change the name of preferred voice to aly energy services inc aly energy or the company and aly operating amended its certificate of incorporation to change the name of aly energy services inc to aly operating inc for financial accounting purposes this acquisition referred to as the merger was a reverse acquisition of preferred voice by aly operating under the acquisition method of accounting and was treated as a recapitalization with aly operating as the accounting acquirer accordingly the consolidated financial statements have been prepared to give retroactive effect of the merger completed on may   and represent the operations of aly operating  acquisition of united centrifuge on april   aly energy acquired the equity interests of united centrifuge llc united as well as certain assets used in uniteds business that were owned by related parties of united collectively the united acquisition in connection with the united acquisition united merged with and into aly centrifuge inc aly centrifuge a whollyowned subsidiary of aly energy united operates within the solids control and fluids management sectors of the oilfield services and rental equipment industry offering its customers the option of renting centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment without personnel or the option of paying for a fullservice solids control package which includes operators onsite  hours a day united owns centrifuges which are differentiated from the competition due to the ability to remove the rotating assembly from a centrifuge within  minutes while on the rig site minimizing customer down time total consideration for the united acquisition of  million included  million cash net of cash acquired of approximately  million the issuance of  shares of redeemable preferred stock at aly centrifuge aly centrifuge redeemable preferred stock  par value at a fair value of  million contingent consideration of up to  million in aggregate over  years at a fair value of  million and a payable of  million the contingent consideration consists of up to three future cash payments to the sellers in an amount equal to  of the gross

which specializes in providing mwd services for total consideration of approximately  million consisting of the issuance of  shares of common stock at an estimated fair value of  million and a payable of  million subsequent to the acquisition aly energy expanded the evolution service offering by adding full package directional drilling services in addition aly energy has invested in the inhouse fabrication of mwd kits which we believe provide a technological advantage over other mwd kits on the market overview of our business we are a provider of surface rental equipment solids control systems and directional drilling services including mwd services our equipment and services are primarily designed for and used in landbased horizontal drilling our equipment includes mud circulating tanks  and  barrel capacity mud pumps diesel and electric live oil skimming systems with mud gas separators flare lines with flare stacks containment systems with stairs portable mud mixing plants centrifuges shakersvertical dryers and mwd kits we also provide personnel at the customers well site to operate our equipment in certain product lines such as skimming systems centrifuges downhole drilling motors and mwd kits and we provide personnel to rig uprigdown and haul our equipment to and from the customers location we service the permian basin in texas and new mexico eagle ford shale utica shale marcellus shale woodford shale granite wash mississippian lime and tuscaloosa marine shale our primary operating yards shop and repair facilities and division management are located in giddings texas san angelo texas prosper texas and houston texas we derive the majority of our operating revenues from day rates or hourly rates charged for the rental of our equipment and for the services provided by our personnel the price we charge for our services depends on both the level of activity within the geographic area in which we operate and also the competitive environment our operating costs do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues our operating expenses consist of both fixed and variable costs although most variable costs are highly correlated with revenues and activity certain variable costs such as sub rental equipment expenses and third party trucking expenses can be reduced as a percentage of revenues by our investment in new rental and transportation equipment  industry trends and outlook current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related level of drilling activity and general production spending in the areas in which we have operations primarily influence the demand for our services the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity in the united states is volatile and may vary based on oil prices governmental regulation governmental limitations on exploration and drilling activity and other factors we operate in the commoditydriven cyclical oil and gas industry since the beginning of  and through mid the industry operated in an environment where crude oil prices largely avoided this cycle during the fourth quarter of  crude oil prices significantly declined due to continued growth in us oil production weakened outlooks for the global economy and continued strong international crude oil supply especially from opecs unexpected decision to maintain oil production levels as a result of the weaker crude oil price environment many crude oil development prospects are or are becoming less economical for many operators leading to an expected downturn in demand for our products and services and an overall weaker demand for oilfield services we experienced reductions in both the pricing and the utilization of our equipment in the fourth quarter of  and we continue to experience such reductions in  although we have implemented significant cost control efforts in  including headcount reductions and field wage reductions we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact of the current market conditions on our operations we believe we will face significant challenges in  primarily due to anticipated continued volatility in oil and gas prices and these challenges may have a significant negative impact on our operations financial results and ability to access capital in  and beyond results of operations our results of operations depend on the demand for our services and our ability to provide high quality equipment and service to satisfy that demand while maintaining an efficient cost structure our results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were significantly impacted by the inclusion of the results of united centrifuge and evolution which were acquired on april   and july   respectively in addition steady demand for our services in our existing markets and strong demand for our services in our new geographic markets had a positive impact on the results of our legacy business results for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   the following table summarizes the change in the results of operations of the company for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   the year ended december   includes the financial results of both united and evolution the acquisitions beginning on april   and july   respectively in thousands   for the years ended december    revenues     expenses operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   selling general and administrative expenses   corporate expenses   total expenses   operating income   other expense interest expense   amortization of deferred loan costs   total other expense   income before income taxes   income tax expense   net income   preferred stock dividends   accretion of preferred stock net    net income available to common shareholders     our revenues for the year ended december   were  million an increase of  compared to  million for the year ended december   the acquisitions contributed  million in revenues during the year ended december   the remaining increase in revenues was due to strong demand for our mud circulating tanks and diesel mud pumps particularly in the permian basin where we began operating in the third quarter of  partially offset by a decline in pricing and demand for our live oil skimming systems our revenues generated from the hauling riguprigdown and cleaning of our equipment increased to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december   while remaining consistent as a percentage of total revenue due to the strong correlation of the revenue generated by these services to our rental revenues and overall level of activity our operating expenses for the year ended december   increased to  million or  of revenues compared to  million or  of revenues for the year ended december   the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of  million of direct costs from the acquisitions during the year ended december   the remaining increase is primarily due to increased thirdparty expenses incurred typically to subrent equipment haul equipment and clean equipment in order to meet the increase in customer demand  depreciation and amortization expense increased  to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of depreciation expense and amortization expense associated with the acquisitions excluding the impact of the acquisitions depreciation expense increased during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a larger fixed asset base throughout  partially offset by a change in the estimated useful lives of certain types of equipment which became effective on july   additional detail on the change in accounting estimate is included in note  to the consolidated financial statements of this form k selling general and administrative expense increased  to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   the  million increase is primarily due to the inclusion of  million of selling general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisitions the remaining increase is due to increased payroll expense and related burden resulting from the expanding scope of operations and the strengthening of infrastructure to enable efficient growth partially offset by a noncash adjustment to the fair value of a contingent payment liability corporate expense increased to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   primarily due to the addition of personnel to support the increased size of the organization resulting from the acquisitions corporate expense consisted primarily of payroll for corporate employees including approximately  and  of stock compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively and legal and professional fees including audit and accounting fees during the years ended december   and  legal and professional fees included fees which were non recurring in nature primarily related to the acquisitions and the share exchange of approximately  million and  million respectively interest expense and amortization of deferred loan costs was  million for the year ended december   compared to approximately  million for the year ended december   the increase in interest expense and amortization of loan costs for the year ended december   primarily relates to the expansion of our credit facility to  million in april  from  million and the additional borrowing incurred in connection with capital investments during the year ended december   to expand our operations we also incurred additional interest expense related to various capital leases and equipment loans entered into during the year ended december   our income tax expense for the year ended december   was  million or  of our income before income taxes compared to income tax expense of  million for the year ended december   or  of our income before income taxes income tax expense includes state income tax which is primarily revenuebased and disproportionately increases income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes nongaap financial measures we disclose and discuss ebitda as nongaap financial measure in our public releases including quarterly earnings releases investor conference calls and other filings with the securities and exchange commission we define ebitda as earnings net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies other companies may calculate ebitda differently than we do which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure we also make certain adjustments to ebitda for i non recurring expenses primarily professional fees related to acquisitions and ii noncash charges such as bad debt expense sharebased compensation expense and the changes in fair value of our liability for contingent payments to derive a normalized ebitda runrate excluding additional non recurring costs and noncash expenses adjusted ebitda which we believe is a useful measure of operating results and the underlying cash generating capability of our business because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap these metrics should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income net income or loss cash flows provided by operating investing and financing activities or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are widely used by investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental financial measures that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt pay deferred taxes and fund growth and maintenance capital expenditures we also believe the disclosure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our cash flow generating capacity from quarter to quarter and year to year ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also financial metrics used by management i as supplemental internal measures for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations ii as a significant criteria for annual incentive cash compensation paid to our executive officers and management iii as a reference point to compare to the ebitda of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions and iv as an assessment of our ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness the following table provides the detailed components of ebitda and adjusted ebitda as we define that term for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands for the years ended december    components of ebitda net income     nongaap adjustments depreciation and amortization   interest expense net   income tax expense   ebitda     adjustments to ebitda stockbased compensation expense   bad debt expense   fair value adjustments to contingent payment liability    nonrecurring expenses   adjusted ebitda     set forth below are the material limitations associated with using ebitda and adjusted ebitda as nongaap financial measures compared to cash flows provided by operating activities ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the future growth and maintenance capital expenditures ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the interest future principal payments and other financingrelated charges necessary to service the debt that we have incurred to finance acquisitions and invest in our fixed asset base ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the deferred income taxes that we will eventually have to pay and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in our net working capital position  management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations in using ebitda and adjusted ebitda as nongaap financial measures by only using ebitda and adjusted ebitda to supplement our gaap results liquidity and capital resources our ongoing capital requirements arise primarily from our need to acquire equipment in order to increase our existing rental fleet and to expand product and service offerings to service our debt and to fund our working capital requirements our sources of liquidity have been internal cash flows from operations borrowings under our credit facility equipment financings and proceeds from the sale of equity we believe that we will have the ability to provide for our operational needs our planned capital expenditures estimated contingencies and possible investments in  through projected operating cash flow and our credit facilities however we anticipate that continued volatility in oil and gas prices during  will affect our operations financial results and ability to access sources of capital should our projected cash flow and credit facilities not be sufficient we may reduce capital expenditures and future investments andor consider the issuance of debt andor equity securities the net cash provided by or used in our operating investing and financing activities during the years ended december   and  is summarized below in thousands for the years ended december    cash provided byused in operating activities     investing activities     financing activities   change in cash and cash equivalents      operating activities for the year ended december   we generated  million of cash from operating activities our net income for the period was  million noncash additions to net income totaled  million consisting of an aggregate of  million in depreciation amortization of intangibles amortization of deferred loan costs  million in deferred taxes and  million of bad debt expense partially offset by a  million fair value adjustment to a contingent payment liability during the year ended december   changes in working capital used  million in cash cash was provided by a net increase in payables and accrued expenses of  million offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of approximately  million due primarily to an increase in revenues in connection with both our legacy business and the acquisitions and to a lesser extent an increase in length of time between the issuance of invoices and collecting payment changes in other current assets resulted in an additional use of cash of  million for the year ended december   we generated  million of cash from operating activities our net income for this period was  million noncash additions to net income totaled  million consisting primarily of  million of depreciation amortization of intangibles and amortization of deferred loan costs during the year ended december   changes in working capital used  million in cash cash was
