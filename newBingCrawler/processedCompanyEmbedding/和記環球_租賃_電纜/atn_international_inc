c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director all right thank you justin and a little bit earlier good morning to everybody on the call so overall operating results for the quarter were strong with growth in both revenues and across all profitability measures as we benefited from the investments made last year in expanding our international telecom properties and the absence of some high transactional integration and similarly unusual expenses that were incurred last year in second quarterinternational telecom was a bright spot with improvements coming from  different areas recent investments and expansion growth and profitability measures and existing businesses and markets and little less important but still important overall finding exits for smaller nonstrategic businesses us telecom declined slightly but more important of course are the changes in the good looking environment for that business which i will cover in more details shortly renewable energy was similar to the first quarter but down on the year because of the reductions in us solar incentive payments and the impact of our india buildout which is still in a prerevenue stage outside the existing segments and businesses the first half of the year has been quiet from the perspective of additional expansion investments which is fine for the moment as we have plenty to do relating to last years transactionsread moreand now ill turn to some more specifics starting with international telecom so the second quarter was similar to the first in that the main driver of yearonyear growth was the  investments we closed last year though in the  second quarter we did have a fairly sizable partial contribution from our bermuda expansion roughly  of the quarter the third quarter will be the first applestoapples quarter excluding some of the smaller dispositions we have made in between which reduces revenue but not ebitda organically we saw a number of positive movements led by continued growth in highspeed data subscribers and the benefit of costcutting measures in selected markets wireless subscribers and arpu each grew at an annual rate of just under  despite the maturity of many of our markets and we ended the quarter with approximately  subscribers for the segment and a blended arpu of  which is heavily weighted by the large number of prepaid customers in guyana in that numberblended churn was  which is a good number especially considering the number of prepaid subs data subscribers totaled about  at the end of the period but comparisons arent really meaningful because of the subscribers coming from the addition of virgin islands market in early july however on a pro forma basis we estimate data subs to be up approximately  organically video subscribers totaled about  for the end of the quarter with comparisons to the prior year not meaningful for the same reason i just mentioned but again here we estimate that on a pro forma basis video subscribers would be down by about  over the year as cord cutting cord shaving and transition activities had negative impacts in addition as with other providers the large investments and improvements weve made over the past year in our highspeed data network in a number of areas helps accelerate the substitution of overthetop video solutions for standard cable tv offerings and so contributes to the video losses but on the other hand much of the acquired tv systems were in particularly bad shape and we have made or in the process  or are in the process of making a number of improvements in the service quality and reliability that should help alleviate that in the futurespeaking of improvements we are basically on track in terms of cost and timing for most of our major wireless and wireline network expansion plans and upgrades the lions share of those activities will be completed in  with some of the fiber expansion and video upgrade plans continuing into moving to us telecom the important thing to discuss here is the forward guidance we gave in the press release so ill start with that longtime followers of atn know that we resist forward guidance outside situations of acquisitions dispositions or fundamental change in us telecom we feel that we are in the latter situation which was what concerned us when we noted last quarter that this business was facing headwinds the best way to look at things is that over the past few years in particular we faced an environment of continual repricing which lowered revenue per megabyte or minute but at the same time was offset by growth in megabytes resulting from higher consumer usage and major capital investments in capacity and technology served the pricing pressure was also offset by growth in our geographic footprint as we continued to build new cell sites throughout this periodnow we have the impact of all the repricing thats been done but we will not have the benefit of growing volume or footprint as the carriers seek to cap their cost of covering rural areas in the midst of falling arpus and increased costs in their core strategic markets adding to the pricing pressure and revenue impacts is the timing of one of our customers exercise of the purchase option of  sites although weve discussed this option arrangement in the past in revenues well feel the impact of these sales and its important to recognize that we benefited from this arrangement in the form of roaming revenues received over the last  years and i  lastly id note that this is the last such option arrangement that we have with carrier customersso we still believe that the shared infrastructure solution for nonstrategic areas that we offer has an excellent value proposition particularly in the current environment but despite that we do not know when or even if we will have the opportunity to take that core model further in the meantime with the build requirements essentially taken out of the business we will see much lower capital expense and we will also look to reduce operating expense below current levels on the revenue side we are working on our strategy and looking in a number of tangential areas as well for growth opportunities but theres nothing right now to point to as likely having a significant nearterm impactmoving to renewable energy the quarter was similar to the first quarter us solar revenues were down on a yearoveryear basis because of expiring state solar subsidy payments in california and because india revenues have not yet started in india we made progress on completing additional power plants and synchronizing with the grid but unfortunately we are still waiting for regulatory approvals in order to begin billing our commercial customers and to determine the value of previously banked poweras is often the case with new projects construction and approval delays have put us behind where we had expected to be at this point but we dont have any fundamental concerns about receiving the regulatory approvals about the quality of the plants or the demand for the power being generated also slow in part due to the construction delays is the placement of project head on the initial india projects it hasnt impacted our phase  builds but it is slowing us down on commencing the next stage of expansion as we want to have greater clarity on debt terms and availability before spending much more equity capital as a result of all of this we are not likely to see significant revenue from india until  which means we are a quarter or more behind where we thought we would be when we last discussed the timetableso just to summarize our international telecom operations are proceeding as expected and we are pleased with the overall progress were seeing there in us telecom we expect to see similar revenue performance in the third quarter compared with this years second quarter followed by a lower fourth quarter reflecting typical seasonality and an even more significant shortfall in  we will try to mitigate a small part of the impact in us telecom by lowering operating expenses in addition we will pare back our  capital spending in this segment which will add to the increased operating cash flow that we expect to achieve in our international telecom operations since we will have completed many of the large network investments there in the meantime we continue to explore opportunities to invest our balance sheet around our expertise and experience in infrastructure services and related areasand now ill turn it back over to justinjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo great thank you michael for the second quarter total consolidated revenues were  million up  from  million in the prior year while consolidated adjusted ebitda increased  to  million representing a  marginreviewing results by segment our us telecom revenues were  million down from  million in the prior year and adjusted ebitda was  million down from  million in  these results include a  million yearonyear decline in wireline revenue that was mainly related to the sale of our northeast wireline business which closed in the first quarter the ebitda impact from that sale was negligible the  million decrease in domestic wireless revenues reflect the impact of the new contractual rates and revenue caps that we discussed last quarter and michael just mentioned further details in our second quarter earnings release this revenue reduction was also the main reason for the decline in adjusted ebitdaas michael mentioned the situation will affect our second half revenue performance and will be more visible in our  as we expect the only remaining site purchase option to be exercised earlier in the year the sales of  sites together with the impact of the reduced rates and revenue caps is expected to result in  revenues for the us telecom segment of between  million and  million we do expect to record a gain on the sale of these sites but additional cash proceeds from the sale will be minimal operating expenses in the segment are tied to the operating  multiple technologies and high traffic volumes and while were already found the easier savings were looking for ways to further reduce our operating expenses and as michael noted earlier we also expect the capital expenditures in that segment will be significantly less going forward benefiting overall free cash flowin the international telecom segment revenues were up significantly again this quarter reflecting the impact of our bermuda and usvi acquisitions increasing  million or  from the previous year and adjusted ebitda increased  to  millionin the renewable energy segment revenue was even with the first quarter but decreased  to  million from the similar period last year and adjusted ebit sic ebitda was down  million to  million yearonyear as michael noted earlier much of this is from the expired energy credits that  and we also saw a slightly weaker energy production this quarter due to the notsogreat weather conditions here in the northeast compared to last year operating expenses were up again in this quarter and several projects became operational in india ahead of the ability to recognize revenuesconsolidated company operating income for the quarter was  million which included  million of depreciation and amortization expense and also included in operating expenses for the quarter were  million of noncash stockbased compensation expense similar to the first quarter we had a  effective tax rate for the quarter and a  effective rate yeartodate as we benefit from having multiple  having profitable operations in  tax jurisdictions along with anticipated tax benefits from the sale of our wireline business in the first quarterlooking at the balance sheet at june  we ended the period with cash and shortterm investments of  million for the  months ended june cash provided by operations was  million and we ended the quarter with total debt outstanding of  million which is up slightly following the refinancing of our bermuda operationscapital expenditures for the quarter totaled  million of which approximately  million was incurred by our us telecom operations  million by our international telecom segment and  million in renewable  in the renewable energy segment yeartodate capital expenditures were  million of which  million was incurred by the telecom segments and  million was related to construction of solar projects as we mentioned previously these spending levels in telecom reflect major network expansion upgrades in multiple markets and should be significantly less in and with that operator wed like to open the call up to questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions and our first question comes from ric prentiss from raymond jamesrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research so first couple questions on the us telecom side i think justin you just mentioned the cash proceeds will be small from the sale is that correct is that because you guys basically had like a year contract to receive all the money that is coming to an end just trying to understand the processjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yes it was really the structure of the deal was that most of the cash and purchase price received over year contract and so its kind of deferred on our balance sheet right nowrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research it was received as roaming revenue then is thatjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yes it was access over roaming so it hasnt gone  i think with the way to explain it it hasnt gone  a piece of it thats identified as the access hasnt run through the pl yetmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director rightjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo but the cash has been receivedmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes it was received over the contract periodrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research and so theres still some money flowing through the income statement and thats why then  part of the reason we see a dropdown in michael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director thats right i mean basically all of it we are focused  all of it will go away in  right sojustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo right so there was revenue on those  sites that we recorded along with deferred purchase price and all of that so the deferred purchase price will be the proceeds from the sale and the revenue goes awaymichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director and will come in below the line right so wont affect that number we gave on revenuesrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research the cash proceeds will be minimalmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director thats correctjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo and thats because theyve been received alreadyrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research right okay and the guidance of  i mean you hate giving it in   million to  million did you say that was for us wireless or thats for us telecomjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo us telecomrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research okay so that would include the remaining kind of small portion of fixed thats in therejustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yes yes which is pretty small but yesrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research and then as we think about that business its got kind of plus percent margins how fast do the costs go away i assume very quickly because any backhaul or electric costs would go with it so is that kind of the frame we should be usingjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo i  what i would say is its difficult to pinpoint as we look for ways to kind of reduce costs but theres a certain amount of the cost structure thats fixed because its either based on supporting the technologies or its supporting the volume of traffic so we are anticipating youre going to see a fairly significant compression in the margins because theres only so much of that fixed cost we can get rid of the fixed cost remains but theres only so much variable costs remaining to work onmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director but to add to that i mean as i think ric youre pointing to on the  sites yes the fixed costs with those  sites go away but the bigger impact is the combination of the impact there but the other impact is what i talked about which is you have no offsetting growth against flowing through the price cuts so thats still going to result in a significant impact down the line from the revenue droprichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research right okay and like you said i think no thoughts of footprint expansion either right nowmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director no no i think the carriers for the most part unless its somehow strategic or related to something else that they are doing or are not really looking to add to costs without a real clear add to revenue which is what for the most part is happening right now with adding to remote rural coveragerichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research and particularly with the first net rollout it looks like therell be some plans for them to expand areas themselvesmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes they have to think about  if youre talking about att sure thats in the mix of how they think about the future and how much they partner with players like us and how much they do and what inaudible of that isrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research but you guys also had participated in the  megahertz auction is that then something you might monetize then if youre kind of looking at cutting capex in the area that was a capital purchase for a longterm asset that maybe youre not going to get much of a return on themmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes i think we examined that i mean youre right thats a consideration i would say thats always the way we think about it we think about the benefit of monetization now versus monetization later you can do that in strategic transactions sooner or you can do it much later its really based on your thinking through the future and then theres the in between aspect of using directly in the business and i think therell be definitely some of that a good chunk of what we bought i think has value in the business but theres maybe a piece that we could look to monetize sooner or later and it really depends on perceptions of valuerichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research have you guys looked at all  obviously theres a lot of buzz about g and small cells and fiber update us on kind of what your thoughts are maybe doesnt fit very well into more rural shared infrastructure mode but just kind of what your thoughts aremichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director we think  i mean we think shared infrastructure period in small cells and backhaul are all part of that will grow we absolutely  we think whether you think of sort of passive sharing to active sharing it will grow i think the trick is whats the business model around it what are the assumptions because those  a lot of those businesses do have pricing risk in the long term because of the customer concentration and the carriers are understandably very cautious about entering into a situation again like they did with the towers companies where they feel that theyve got cost base rising way beyond their growth rate so as long as youre i think realistic about all that in assessing the risk theres opportunity i think the carriers absolutely need third parties to help build that infrastructure and that ultimately its more efficient so we are actively as with many others looking at those areas theres some like some of the pure backhaul plays i feel that are  and i can completely be wrong are overvalued for the risk down the line of repricing youve seen movements like verizon announcing the purchase of a lot of fiber in order to make sure that they have a stick and a carrot in their hand i think on backhaul contracts so its just  thats just an important considerationoperator and our next question comes from barry sine from drexel hamiltonbarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research let me follow up on rics comments on the domestic wireless and the option do you have the date that they have to give you notification to exercise that option im assuming there has to be an sec license transfer for that so that would delay it and that its probably not beginning of the year its probably sometime midyear if they did exercise that we would see that closemichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director no i think the process of closing and the way weve  this is the last of a series of those weve done and i think both the carrier and we have gotten pretty smooth in working that and part of the way we did that we structured the spectrum as a lease so that those clearances dont really matter so its much more about clearing the cell sites and the documentation and all that but it was set up to go pretty smoothly and we will make every effort to make sure it does i mean thats part of our relationship promisebarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research and clarity on the exercise date and the close datemichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes just early  but the important part is we dont think there are really any economics in that in  thats what were saying not significantmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yesbarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research okay shifting over to international on the us virgin islands and the bermuda properties where you made the investments last year i appreciate the update you gave on what youre doing with network capital spending could you talk about where you are in terms of your marketing are you  where you want to be in terms of the offers that are in the marketplace are you delaying that until you get network upgrades done and then where are you on the backoffice part of the changes in order to drive margin improvements in those marketsmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes those are all good questions and the kind of things were heavily focused on were still working through all that so weve made progress on  weve rebranded in both bermuda and the virgin islands but in terms of  and weve been happy with the quality of that effort but there are pieces of the bundle if you will that still need improvement so the biggest and most obvious one is in the virgin islands we are still working off our old wireless network and doing a complete upgrade that we expect to finish at the end of this quarter and then really launch in the fourth quarter so that ones to come and similarly in the bermuda market the cable tv product needed a lot of work right it had been under invested in and weve gotten a lot of things improved in terms of the network but theres still more to be done to improve the customer experience and really have the kind of positioning and customer satisfaction where we want to have itbarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research okay and then staying on international if you could give us an update on some of the competitive trends in the guyana market and then obviously theres been some regulatory issues that youve talked about in the past if you could update us on where that market standsmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes in that market the competitive dynamics are  we are building and have invested in the last  years very significantly in the wireline network in the broadband network which also benefits the wireless network and weve also invested there so we think the offerings are really coming together probably more important is weve also done a lot of work internally with team and positioning and thats starting to show some fruits but on the wireless side we still have a ways to go to have the kind of competitive stance we want and youve seen signs that maybe weve certainly come back from the bottom but you havent seen signs that weve become a leader yet but we think were well positioned to be  to really improve there make sure our competitor will continue to try to respond as well but  and in terms of regulatory theres regulatory issues in really all markets the guyana market is different in that theres been a lot  theres been discussions onagain offagain between us and the government for years about opening up the wireline sector more and real reforming the whole telecom sector which were in favor of and the governments acknowledged that publicly i mean its really a question of government resources more than anything else in terms of the timing of getting that done and weve predicted the timing of that in the past and weve always been wrong so we just decided well just forebear and well stick to our knitting and keep improving the businessbarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research okay and then to tie that all together on the international telecom segment if i look at your revenue ebitda numbers sequentially versus q and i appreciate the fact youre giving more and more operating metrics on that business maybe im reading too much into this but it looks like were seeing early signs of improvement are you  would you agree with that are you happy with the early signals that youre seeing coming out of those markets are you  where you expect to bemichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes we always expect to be a little bit farther along i think but yes we are pleased we are seeing signs of that improvement for sure we have a lot of confidence in the leadership teams and what theyre doing right now and so we feel good about that but there are things that we would like to go faster our approach as we’ve said before has been get the customer experience right first and second work on other efficiencies so thats been the way we prioritize it but the second part especially with justin right here it really matters right so hes  he wants to see that happen to to improve margins and things but i think the first stage has gone wellbarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research im with justin on thatmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director we all arebarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research last question turning to the india renewables business a little bit of a surprise in your remarks today and you called out some regulatory delays thats a country that has been known to have regulatory problems and there  what assurances can you give us this is not going to spiral to quarters or years or just not get approvals you still sound relatively confident that this is a minor delay but whenever you hear regulatory challenges and the word india in the same sentence your hackles go upmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes fair enough i clearly cant make a guarantee but i can say that theres nothing we see today that makes us feel that these delays are anything unusual or anything indicative of a change in policy approach and the like i mean india for the most part both federal and state governments have been pushing hard to get additional power generation into the mix and so we think the fundamentals continue to be strong the governments continue to be behind it and its really a question of bureaucracy some slowness and its not  always the local regulators we might miss a timing on a little bit of a sequence and then kind of pay for that because of the process so it is laborious in india as anyone knows even when you have absolutely no problem government license going on the amount of steps you have to go through and the personal submitting of papers and continuing to meet just makes it slow and we knew that was a part of the business going in and its just been a little bit slower some of which as i noted in my remarks is because of our construction delays and some of it is on the regulator side and so i still –sorry just to sum it up so youre right we still feel that theres nothing fundamental there and we still feel that that will get donebarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research okay and also the last question on the renewables business if i look at capex in q in that segment versus q obviously a big step down so are you kind of holding off on capex until you get a bit more visibility on these delays and what should we expect for capital spending in the second half of the year on the renewables segmentjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo we kind of – barry its justin we updated the guidance on that and a lot of it is around the financing timing too so thats why its a little bit of a push out and it might be more of a push into  then in the second half because weve kind of done this i think as michael noted the first phase was kind of down with the equity capital and now were refinancing so weve got to get the refinancing done and then reinvest it so its a little bit more of a push out so i think youll see much lower in the second half unless things kind of accelerate along a little quicker so its kind of teetering between end of  and michael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yesbarry michael sine drexel hamilton llc research division  md of equity research and im assuming regulatory approvals are key to getting that financingmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes they are i mean they help with the bigger financing yes for sure because then your  its a lot easier when theyre all operational and the revenue is flowingoperator and our next question comes from allen klee from sidotiallen r klee sidoti  company llc  senior equity research analyst just going back to us telecom segment i just wanted to understand your comments on margins for  youre losing some profitable  very profitable business but youre going to try to cut costs how do we think about the net impact on margins therejustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo you will see  i mean the nature of the business as i mentioned is theres a certain amount of profit that are just fixed so there will be some fairly significant margin compression in  which just has to be because were still going to be running traffic but we wont be getting the revenue on itmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director or as muchjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo as much rightallen r klee sidoti  company llc  senior equity research analyst okay and then in international for similar on how do you think about the path towards  you have  i think your ebitda margin was around  in the quarter in terms of timing to try to get to kind of where you think is more optimalmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes i think we would hope to start to see progress in those margins as we go through  we dont think theyll be major  itll be major initially and there are  components there is the revenue growth side including  we hope with wireless in the virgin islands and some of the other areas and then there is the hard work of working through making the organizations more efficient and again given our sequence that its first catch the ball if you will and then run and the catch the ball is get the offerings right and then well go to the next sequence so i think  i dont think youll see major improvements but well  if were successful theyll start to gather a little bit youll start to see in the next  to  quarters to be frankjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yes let me speak about it i think the thing youd keep in mind is that as we move through launching these networks and repackaging wireless will have higher and should have higher marketing expense to kind of get these things launched and somewhat offsetting that will be things were doing in the back office to reduce cost but you wont see it necessarily coming through on a consolidated but its shifting on where were spending the moneymichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director in the near termjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yes in the near termmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes does that make sense allen do you have a followupallen r klee sidoti  company llc  senior equity research analyst yes then a smaller question but just so i can maybe help understand your business a little better in international telecom equipment revenue these past  quarters it was a higher rate than last  quarters of  and now its kind of at a lower rate maybe if i could just understand whats going on there and how you think about that going forwardmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes thats just the underlying ebb and flow of different marketing offerings andjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo the holiday seasonmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director the gross ad paysjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yesmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director theres nothing  i dont think theres any significant change in trends there to talk to i mean there are times where well have promotions around launches and thats for example justin talk about with the initial launch in the virgin islands and you expect to see equipment expense really go up and there are other markets where we may from time to time use that and we really think of that as a piece of the marketing budget and one of the tools in the toolbox there but there is nothing kind of fundamentaloperator our next question comes from sergey dluzhevskiy from gabelli  companysergey dluzhevskiy g research llc  research analyst a couple questions first one just i guess a broad question on the opportunities that you see to diversify your portfolio obviously you still have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and capacity to pursue various acquisitions so where do see most attractive opportunities right now and what precludes you from pulling the trigger lets saymichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes we see actually a number of areas were exploring i think we see it in some of the fairly obvious telecom infrastructure plays shared infrastructure side that we spoke about earlier in the call in response to the question from ric prentiss we see that in us and nonus markets as having some potential and we see some tangential things we have  we really are  telecom markets are well behind more advanced high  growth markets in terms of the some of the addon offerings in tangential areas some of the managed services backed and things like that and we think there is potential there in smaller markets and then we also continue to believe the renewal energy sector is going to continue to grow in some ways its growing faster than we would like in that capitals flowing very quickly markets go very quickly to a high capital inflow into the sector which brings down potential returns and sometimes to a point where we dont find them attractive from a riskreward basis but we still think as india gets going we have additional mind share for looking for opportunities to further expand thatsergey dluzhevskiy g research llc  research analyst okay in terms of capex could you help us i guess size potential declines in capex or discuss some of the things that obviously are still going to be there in  versus  in terms of capexmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes i mean i think the main one to talk about is the international telecom segment you want to talk about that justinjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo yes i mean i think were not done fully baking in  yet but i think if you are just to kind of apply industry standard kind of spend metrics or levels youd probably put it at about half of what we forecast for this yearsergey dluzhevskiy g research llc  research analyst okay and last question in your international markets if you could talk a little bit about your spectrum position whether you think its sufficient given the rise of data and demand for data as those markets transition to g and eventually g and whether there are any options that could be meaningful coming up in some of your marketsmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes justin wanted me to say its huge tremendous but i think in most markets its  were quite comfortable with where we are today in terms of our spectrum availability in place like the virgin islands we have a really great spectrum position in places like bermuda its enough for where we want to be today in guyana its skinnier and i  but i mentioned in both bermuda and guyana our competitor is in the same situation so its really about getting the governments to see that it helps everybody to release more spectrum for the players and that will be needed if they want the wireless data infrastructure to continue to grow without having it be cost prohibitive to the usersoperator and our next question comes from hamed khorsand from bws financialhamed khorsand bws financial inc  principal and research analyst just a simple question here are you able to charge the customers in india that are set up for renewables but you just cant bill themmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director we are producing the power that  and we cant bill them until we have whats called the open access certifications done which the regulator needs to do and when i refer to banked power there is an ability which we cant just estimate in exact number so we cant really put anything through the pl but there is an ability to then sell to your customer or potentially to the grid generally the power were producing today and catch up to it but its not a huge number at this pointhamed khorsand bws financial inc  principal and research analyst okay is there any intention to keep growing the customer base even though you cant bill them right nowmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director no absolutely i mean i think were  i think in terms of the  what is built and operational we have the customers we need but we have built up a pipeline of both customers and grid connections going forward and land to build and so were really  were staged to be ready but it really depends upon the sequence of events we talk about get this first one first phase operational billing and get the debt in place so that we know how that will affect the economics for us going forward and then continuehamed khorsand bws financial inc  principal and research analyst okay and then could you clarify i know you said  sites for us telecom what does that  sites equate to as far as base stations because it seems like its a very lopsided as far as the revenue rolling off for justin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo im not sure how many base stations are on that butmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director its  its more or less the same number so its  go ahead justinjustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo some of that though hamed its the combination of the rates the caps and the sale sohamed khorsand bws financial inc  principal and research analyst youre giving us  the press release i think was like a  base stations or  sites there are  base stations about  but the revenue rolloff is quite a bit morejustin d benincasa atn international inc  cfo right but that includes like i said the rates  that includes rate reductions caps plus the sale so its not all thats related to the salemichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director right plus the sale plus that sale as we talked about before had an element in it of  to make  generate returns from it you could argue its a little higher but the main point is the one i made earlier and justin just made which is youve got the impact across the existing base stations that are left at the same timeoperator and we have a followup question from the line of ric prentissrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research a couple other extra ones on renewables when you talk about the regulatory approval process in india do you need to get that regulatory approval process each time you work on a site is it per jurisdiction or is it just hey once i get this regulatory approval i can ramp the bill schedule you were talking aboutmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director there is a layer of it and its kind of complicated but what i refer to as the open access certification i hope i get this right is that you can get it  you can get the certification for multiple customers at the same time in a whole plant if theyre ready or you can do in piece parts by customer by piece of the plant and in some cases it makes sense for us to do the latter and in some cases the former so its really the way to think about it it is all the megawatts that youre selling off to people through this method which is all of what were building need approval under the open access certificationrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research so then each time youre going to open up one of the plants and have more megawatts you are going to need to go through the processmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director thats right and the process has been established its been around for quite a long time because its not limited to renewables and so a lot of industrial customers and the like we build diesel gen sets and do it so the process is fairly well understood its just a question of did you get into the cycle at the right time and now you have to  if you didnt you now have to wait for sort of bureaucratic delay more than if theres any fundamental questionrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research is it fair to say that youll build that process in bureaucracy layers into your next considerations of expansion then as far as timing of the capitalmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes yes absolutely i think were learning in terms of sequencing i think well also get smoother at it so shorter times but were learning from sequencing and all that but you always do have a bureaucratic delay risk because at some point in time you can get in a situation where its pushing on a wet noodle its not really  it should be straightforward but youre just waiting for it to get into the list of prioritiesrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research and are you looking  with your balance sheet capacity are you looking at markets outside of india as well for renewablemichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes we are its a higher bar the bar gets lower as we move along and the india group gets fully operational so its a prioritization approach and when we look at other markets if theyre new markets to us theres a number of hurdles for that both in terms of returns and do we have the right partners in the market do we feel we adequately understand the risks and we do  yes sorry go aheadrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research can you narrow down kind of what regions of the world you might be looking atmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director i cant really i mean i think because we have looked at things in a variety of different regions so i  no i cant really narrow it down but the farther afield it is or the smaller the place or the trickier the political situation or  the less likely we are to go there where it is so you could kind of go if you look at the sector you can go through and see the markets that are  where the governments and the utilities have set up an environment where investment is more straightforward into the sector and those are the  those tend to be the ones we look at unless we otherwise have somebody with great knowledge of the marketrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research then as you get the project financing and refinancing in place youve mentioned that youll be able to give us a more clarity on kind of the capex revenue expense return drivers so hopefully thats still on track and then as you look at other countries how replicable is the india model or how different might it bemichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director the  i think most of them are a bit different than the india model the  a lot of countries are more connected with paying into the grid company itself as your customer or the state and what we liked about the india model its similar to our us and its similar to kind of a net metering arrangement in the us for the commercial industrial customers but this is pretty fluid i mean our team with no better than i but i think that there are governments looking at implementing new policies to encourage that foreign direct investment in the sector really across the place and to go back to your return thing youre right i mean i think its too uncertain now i mean right if you think about the capital end and the delay to revenue well thats a negative on returns to date right so today if you stop the music today were below where we want it to be but there are things that could happen that we could do that could put us right back to where we expected to be and getting the debt in place obviously is a key component to figuring out what your equity returns arerichard hamilton prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research and then i think you mentioned or called out something about some renewable benefits expiring was that some new ones expiring in the quarter or is that just on the yearoveryear comparisonmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director that was just the yearonyear this first quarterrichard hamilton prentiss raymond james

prentiss raymond james  associates inc research division  head of telecommunication services equity research okay all right and then last question i appreciate the time in the international market a lot more focus on bundling i think you mentioned that how do you view bundling going forward does it work does it reduce churn kind of how youre thinking about bundling because weve not seen a lot of bundling in the usmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director yes i think its very different environment in these markets i  the closest proxy in the us would be a specialized small kind of contained rural or regional market but like a shentel right is probably the best example i think we have never believed that the one bill really matters all that much but i do think  the way we think of it is we can provide  we can be kind of agnostic and provide the connectivity the market needs in whichever way is most attractive to the consumer and most efficient for us economically and i think consumers do  there is some benefit to them if its done right to having the relationships pull together so and your  you can determine what the thing is that they care more about that you have a competitive advantage on and use that in your pricing of the bundle to help so we think it does have value and it does work but if any piece of your bundle is not competitive with the other offerings its got to be close or it doesnt really work does that make sense ric or do you have a followup i think we lost himoperator operator instructions and at this moment im showing no further questionsmichael t c prior atn international inc  ceo president and director okay thats all we have folks thank you everyone well see you in a few monthsoperator ladies and gentlemen thank
