called orange trees see les orangers for other uses see orange disambiguation an orange whole and split orange blossoms and oranges on tree oranges and orange juice the orange is the fruit of the citrus species citrus × sinensis in the family rutaceae it is also called sweet orange to distinguish it from the related citrus × aurantium referred to as bitter orange the sweet orange reproduces asexually apomixis through nucellar embryony varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations the orange is a hybrid between pomelo citrus maxima and mandarin citrus reticulata it has genes that are  pomelo and  mandarin however it is not a simple backcrossed bc hybrid but hybridized over multiple generations the chloroplast genes and therefore the maternal line seem to be pomelo the sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced earlier estimates of the percentage of pomelo genes varying from  to  have been reported sweet oranges were mentioned in chinese literature in  bc as of update orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit the fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh or processed for its juice or fragrant peel as of update sweet oranges accounted for approximately  of citrus production in   million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide with brazil producing

citrus and remain almost entirely interfertile this includes grapefruits lemons limes oranges and various other types and hybrids as the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars and bud mutations have also been selected their taxonomy is fairly controversial confusing or inconsistent the fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium a kind of modified berry it is covered by a rind originated by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall different names have been given to the many varieties of the genus orange applies primarily to the sweet orange – citrus sinensis l osbeck the orange tree is an evergreen flowering tree with an average height of  to  m  to  ft although some very old specimens can reach  m  ft its oval leaves alternately arranged are  to  cm  to  in long and have crenulate margins sweet oranges grow in a range of different sizes and shapes varying from spherical to oblong inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue the white bitter mesocarp or albedo pith the orange contains a number of distinct carpels segments inside typically about ten each delimited by a membrane and containing many juicefilled vesicles and usually a few seeds pips when unripe the fruit is green the grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yelloworange but frequently retains green patches or under warm climate conditions remains entirely green like all other citrus fruits the sweet orange is nonclimacteric the citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics common oranges blood or pigmented oranges navel oranges and acidless oranges other citrus groups also known as oranges are bitter orange citrus aurantium also known as seville orange sour orange especially when used as rootstock for a sweet orange tree bigarade orange and marmalade orange like the sweet orange it is a pomelo x mandarin hybrid bergamot orange citrus bergamia risso grown mainly in italy for its peel producing a primary essence for perfumes also used to flavor earl grey tea it is a hybrid probably bitter orange x limetta trifoliate orange poncirus trifoliata sometimes included in the genus classified as citrus trifoliata it often serves as a rootstock for sweet orange trees and other citrus cultivars mandarin orange citrus reticulata is an original species of citrus and is a progenitor of the common orange an enormous number of cultivars have like the sweet orange a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry some cultivars are mandarinpomelo hybrids bred from the same parents as the sweet orange eg the tangor and ponkan tangerine other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids eg clementines mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate easier to peel and less acidic pomelo traits include a thick white albedo rind pith mesocarp that is more closely attached to the segments orange trees generally are grafted the bottom of the tree including the roots and trunk is called rootstock while the fruitbearing top has two different names budwood when referring to the process of grafting and scion when mentioning the variety of orange etymology main article orange word the word orange derives from the sanskrit word for orange tree नारङ्ग nāraṅga which is probably of dravidian origin the sanskrit word reached european languages through persian نارنگ nārang and its arabic derivative نارنج nāranj the word entered late middle english in the fourteenth century via old french orenge in the phrase pomme dorenge the french word in turn comes from old provençal auranja based on arabic nāranj in several languages the initial n present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because it may have been mistaken as part of an indefinite article ending in an n sound—in french for example une norenge may have been heard as une orenge this linguistic change is called juncture loss the color was named after the fruit and the first recorded use of orange as a color name in english was in  a closeup of an orange blossom as portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange to some regions of europe in several modern indoeuropean languages the fruit has been named after them some examples are albanian portokall bulgarian портокал portokal greek πορτοκάλι portokali macedonian portokal persian پرتقال porteghal turkish portakal and romanian portocală related names can be found in other languages such as arabic البرتقال bourtouqal georgian ფორთოხალი portoxali turkish portakal and amharic birtukan also in some of the italian regional languages eg neapolitan an orange is portogallo or purtuallo literally the portuguese one in contrast to the italian arancia in other indoeuropean languages the words for orange allude to the eastern origin of the fruit and can be translated literally as apple from china some examples are german apfelsine alternative name for orange and common in northern germany dutch appelsien and sinaasappel swedish apelsin and norwegian appelsin a similar case is puerto rican spanish china various slavic languages use the variants pomaranč slovak pomeranč czech pomaranča slovene and pomarańcza polish all from old french pomme dorenge varieties common oranges common oranges also called white round or blond oranges constitute about twothirds of all the orange production the majority of this crop is used mostly for juice extraction valencia main article valencia orange an orange grove in florida the valencia orange is a lateseason fruit and therefore a popular variety when navel oranges are out of season this is why an anthropomorphic orange was chosen as the mascot for the  fifa world cup held in spain the mascot was named naranjito little orange and wore the colors of the spanish national football team harts tardiff valencia thomas rivers an english nurseryman imported this variety from the azores islands and catalogued it in  under the name excelsior around  he provided trees to s b parsons a long island nurseryman who in turn sold them to e h hart of federal point florida hamlin this cultivar was discovered by a g hamlin near glenwood florida in  the fruit is small smooth not highly colored and juicy with a pale yellow colored juice especially in fruits that come from lemon rootstock the fruit may be seedless or may contain a number of small seeds the tree is highyielding and coldtolerant and it produces good quality fruit which is harvested from october to december it thrives in humid subtropical climates in cooler more arid areas the trees produce edible fruit but too small for commercial use trees from groves in hammocks or areas covered with pine forest are budded on sour orange trees a method that gives a high solids content on sand they are grafted on rough lemon rootstock the hamlin orange is one of the most popular juice oranges in florida and replaces the parson brown variety as the principal earlyseason juice orange this cultivar is nowneeds update the leading early orange in florida and possibly in the rest of the world other varieties of common oranges bali

these oranges were the leading export from the kona district on the big island of hawaii in kailuakona some of the original stock still bears fruit lue gim gong grown in florida is an early scion developed by lue gim gong a chinese immigrant known as the citrus genius in  lue crosspollinated two orange varieties – the harts late valencia and the mediterranean sweet – and obtained a fruit both sweet and frosttolerant this variety was propagated at the glen st mary nursery which in  received the silver wilder medal by the american pomological society originally considered a hybrid the lue gim gong orange was later found to be a nucellar seedling of the valencia type which is properly called lue gim gong since  the lue gim gong variety is grown in florida although sold under the general name valencia macetera grown in spain it is known for its unique flavor orange seedling — although a hybrid orange usually comes true from seed through maternal apomixis malta grown in pakistan

relatively low in acid medan grown in medan indonesia midsweet grown in florida it is a newer scion similar to the hamlin and pineapple varieties it is hardier than pineapple and ripens later the fruit production and quality are similar to those of the hamlin but the juice has a deeper color moro tarocco grown in italy it is oval resembles a tangelo and has a distinctive caramelcolored endocarp this color is the result of a pigment called anthocarpium not usually found in citruses but common in red fruits and flowers the original mutation occurred in sicily in the seventeenth century mosambi grown in india and pakistan it is so low in acid and insipid that it might be classified as acidless narinja grown in andhra south india parson brown grown in florida mexico and turkey

sectioned the underdeveloped twin fruit is located on the bottom right navel oranges are characterized by the growth of a second fruit at the apex which protrudes slightly and resembles a human navel they are primarily grown for human consumption for various reasons their thicker skin makes them easy to peel they are less juicy and their bitterness – a result of the high concentrations of limonin and other limonoids – renders them less suitable for juice their widespread distribution and long growing season have made navel oranges very popular in the united states they are available from november to april with peak supplies in january february and march in this navel orange the second fruit can clearly be seen at the base according to a  study by palemon dorsett archibald dixon shamel and wilson popenoe of the united states department of agriculture usda a single mutation in a selecta orange tree planted on the grounds of a monastery near bahia brazil probably yielded the first navel orange between  and  nevertheless a researcher at the university of california riverside has suggested that the parent variety was more likely the portuguese navel orange umbigo described by antoine risso and pierre antoine poiteau in their book histoire naturelle des orangers natural history of orange trees – the mutation caused the orange to develop a second fruit at its base opposite the stem embedded within the peel of the primary orange navel oranges were introduced in australia in  and in florida in  in  twelve cuttings of the original tree were transplanted to riverside california where the fruit became known as washington this cultivar was very successful and rapidly spread to other countries because the mutation left the fruit seedless and therefore sterile the only method to cultivate navel oranges was to graft cuttings onto other varieties of citrus trees the california citrus state historic park and the orcutt ranch horticulture center preserve the history of navel oranges in riverside today navel oranges continue to be propagated through cutting and grafting this does not allow for the usual selective breeding methodologies and so all navel oranges can be considered fruits from that single nearly twohundredyearold tree they have exactly the same genetic makeup as the original tree and are therefore clones this case is similar to that of the common yellow seedless banana the cavendish or that of the granny smith apple on rare occasions however further mutations can lead to new varieties cara cara navels cara cara orange slices left cara cara oranges also called red navel are a type of navel orange grown mainly in venezuela south africa and in californias san joaquin valley they are sweet and comparatively low in acid with a bright orange rind similar to that of other navels but their flesh is distinctively pinkish red it is believed that they have originated as a cross between the washington navel and the brazilian bahia

succari in egypt and lima in brazil the lack of acid which protects orange juice against spoilage in other groups renders them generally unfit for processing as juice so they are primarily eaten they remain profitable in areas of local consumption but rapid spoilage renders them unsuitable for export to major population centres of europe asia or the united states attributes sensory factors octyl acetate a volatile compound contributing to the fragrance of oranges the taste of oranges is determined mainly by the relative ratios of sugars and acids whereas orange aroma derives from volatile organic compounds including alcohols aldehydes ketones terpenes and esters bitter limonoid compounds such as limonin decrease gradually during development whereas volatile aroma compounds tend to peak in mid– to late–season development taste quality tends to improve later in harvests when there is a higher sugaracid ratio with less bitterness as a citrus fruit the orange is acidic with ph levels

united states department of agriculture usda has established the following grades for florida oranges which primarily apply to oranges sold as fresh fruit us fancy us no  bright us no  us no  golden us no  bronze us no  russet us no  bright us no  us no  russet and us no  the general characteristics graded are color both hue and uniformity firmness maturity varietal characteristics texture and

dynasty npm the orange is unknown in the wild state it is assumed to have originated in southern china northeastern india and perhaps southeastern asia and that they were first cultivated in china around  bc in europe the moors introduced the orange to spain which was known as alandalus modern andalusia with large scale cultivation starting in the th century as evidenced by complex irrigation techniques specifically adapted to support orange orchards citrus fruits — among them the bitter orange — were introduced to sicily in the th century during the period of the emirate of sicily but the sweet orange was unknown until the late th century or the beginnings of the th century when italian and portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the mediterranean area shortly afterward the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit it also was considered a luxury item and wealthy people grew oranges in private conservatories called orangeries by  the sweet orange was well known throughout europe spanish travelers introduced the sweet orange into the american continent on his second voyage in  christopher columbus may have planted the fruit in hispaniola subsequent expeditions in the mids brought sweet oranges to south america and mexico and to florida in  when pedro menéndez de avilés founded st augustine spanish missionaries brought orange trees to arizona between  and  while the franciscans did the same in san diego california in  an orchard was planted at the san gabriel mission around  and a commercial orchard was established in  near presentday los angeles in louisiana oranges were probably introduced by french explorers archibald menzies the botanist and naturalist on the vancouver expedition collected orange seeds in south africa raised the seedlings onboard and gave them to several hawaiian chiefs in  eventually the sweet orange was grown in wide areas of the hawaiian islands but its cultivation stopped after the arrival of the mediterranean fruit fly in the early s as oranges are rich in vitamin c and do not spoil easily during the age of discovery portuguese spanish and dutch sailors planted citrus trees along trade routes to prevent scurvy florida farmers obtained seeds from new orleans around  after which orange groves were established by grafting the sweet orange on to sour orange rootstocks cultivation climate an orange tree covered and damaged from snow in the netherlands orange grove in california like most citrus plants oranges do well under moderate temperatures—between  and  °c  and  °f—and require considerable amounts of sunshine and water it has been suggested the use of water resources by the citrus industry in the middle east is a contributing factor to the desiccation of the region another significant element in the full development of the fruit is the temperature variation between summer and winter and between day and night in cooler climates oranges can be grown indoors as oranges are sensitive to frost there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected a common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with a thin layer of ice that will stay just at the freezing point insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower this is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees this practice however offers protection only for a very short time another procedure is burning fuel oil in smudge pots put between the trees these devices burn with a great deal of particulate emission so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in southern california in january  destroyed a whole crop propagation see also fruit tree propagation and citrus rootstock it is possible to grow orange trees directly from seeds but they may be infertile or produce fruit that may be different from its parent for the seed of a commercial orange to grow it must be kept moist at all times one approach is placing the seeds between two sheets of damp paper towel until they germinate and then planting them although many cultivators just set the seeds straight into the soil commercially grown orange trees are propagated asexually by grafting a mature cultivar onto a suitable seedling rootstock to ensure the same yield identical fruit characteristics and resistance to diseases throughout the years propagation involves two stages first a rootstock is grown from seed then when it is approximately one year old the leafy top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety is grafted into its bark the scion is what determines the variety of orange while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions thus rootstocks influence the rate of growth and have an effect on fruit yield and quality rootstocks must be compatible with the variety inserted into them because otherwise the tree may decline be less productive or die among the several advantages to grafting are that trees mature uniformly and begin to bear fruit earlier than those reproduced by seeds  to  years in contrast with  to  years and that it makes it possible to combine the best attributes of a scion with those of a rootstock harvest canopyshaking mechanical harvesters are being used increasingly in florida to harvest oranges current canopy shaker machines use a series of sixtosevenfoot long tines to shake the tree canopy at a relatively constant stroke and frequency normally oranges are picked once they are pale orange degreening oranges must be mature when harvested in the united states laws forbid harvesting immature fruit for human consumption in texas arizona california and florida ripe oranges however often have some green or yellowgreen color in the skin ethylene gas is used to turn green skin to orange this process is known as degreening also called gassing sweating or curing oranges are nonclimacteric fruits and cannot postharvest ripen internally in response to ethylene gas though they will degreen externally storage a stand with oranges at a market in morocco commercially oranges can be stored by refrigeration in controlledatmosphere chambers for up to  weeks after harvest storage life ultimately depends on cultivar maturity preharvest conditions and handling in stores and markets however oranges should be displayed on nonrefrigerated shelves at home oranges have a shelf life of about one month in either case optimally they are stored loosely in an open or perforated plastic bag pests and diseases see also list of citrus diseases cottony cushion scale the first major pest that attacked orange trees in the united states was the cottony cushion scale icerya purchasi imported from australia to california in  within  years it wiped out the citrus orchards around los angeles and limited orange growth throughout california in  the usda sent alfred koebele to australia to study this scale insect in its native habitat he brought back with him specimens of novius cardinalis an australian ladybird beetle and within a decade the pest was controlled citrus greening disease the citrus greening disease caused by the bacterium liberobacter asiaticum has been the most serious threat to orange production since  it is characterized by streaks of different shades on the leaves and deformed poorly colored unsavory fruit in areas where the disease is endemic citrus trees live for only five to eight years and never bear fruit suitable for consumption in the western hemisphere the disease was discovered in florida in  where it has attacked nearly all the trees ever since it was reported in brazil by fundecitrus brasil in  as from   of the trees in brazils main orange growing areas são paulo and minas gerais showed symptoms of greening an increase of  over  the disease is spread primarily by two species of psyllid insects one of them is the asian citrus psyllid diaphorina citri kuwayama an efficient vector of the liberobacter asiaticum generalist predators such as the ladybird beetles curinus coeruleus olla vnigrum harmonia axyridis and cycloneda sanguinea and the lacewings ceraeochrysa spp and chrysoperla spp make significant contribution to the mortality of the asian citrus psyllid which results in – reduction in psyllid populations in contrast parasitism by tamarixia radiata a speciesspecific parasitoid of the asian citrus psyllid is variable and generally low in southwest florida in  it amounted to a reduction of less than  from may to september and  in november in  foliar applications of insecticides reduced psyllid populations for a short time but also suppressed the populations of predatory ladybird beetles soil application of aldicarb provided limited control of asian citrus psyllid while drenches of imidacloprid to young trees were effective for two months or more management of citrus greening disease is difficult and requires an integrated approach that includes use of clean stock elimination of inoculum via voluntary and regulatory means use of pesticides to control psyllid vectors in the citrus crop and biological control of psyllid vectors in noncrop reservoirs citrus greening disease is not under completely successful management greasy

the indian river area of florida is known for the high quality of its juice which often is sold fresh in the united states and frequently blended with juice produced in other regions because indian river trees yield very sweet oranges but in relatively small quantities production of orange juice between the são paulo and midsouth florida areas makes up roughly  of the world market brazil exports  of its production while  of floridas production is consumed in the united states orange juice is traded internationally in the form of frozen concentrated orange juice to reduce the volume used so that storage and transportation costs are lower juice and other products oranges whose flavor may vary from sweet to sour are commonly peeled and eaten fresh or squeezed for juice the thick bitter rind is usually discarded but can be processed into animal feed by desiccation using pressure and heat it also is used in certain recipes as a food flavoring or garnish the outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a zester to produce orange zest zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor similar to that of the orange pulp the white part of the rind including the pith is a source of pectin and has nearly the same amount of vitamin c as the flesh and other nutrients although not as juicy or tasty as the flesh orange peel is edible and has significant contents of vitamin c dietary fiber total polyphenols carotenoids limonene and dietary minerals such as potassium and magnesium products made from oranges jar of marmalade orange juice is
