navigation search a trade route is a logistical network identified as a series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo the term can also be used to refer to trade over bodies of water allowing goods to reach distant markets a single trade route contains long distance arteries which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes among notable trade routes was the amber road which served as a dependable network for longdistance trade maritime trade along the spice route became prominent during the middle ages when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route during the middle ages organizations such as the hanseatic league aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade became increasingly prominent in modern times commercial activity shifted from the major trade routes of the old world to newer routes between modern nationstates this activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international freetrade agreements which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions innovative transportation of

developmentedit long distance trade routes were developed in the chalcolithic period the period from the middle of the nd millennium bce to the beginning of the common era saw societies in western asia the mediterranean china and the indian subcontinent develop major transportation networks for trade one of the vital instruments which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden organized caravans visible by the nd millennium bce could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way the domestication of camels allowed arabian nomads to control the long distance trade in spices and silk from the far east to the arabian peninsula caravans were useful in longdistance trade largely for carrying luxury goods the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators with productive developments in iron and bronze technologies newer trade routes—dispensing innovations of civilizations—began to rise maritime tradeedit much of the radhanites indian ocean trade would have depended on coastal cargoships such as this dhow main article ship transport evidence of maritime trade between civilizations dates back at least  millennia navigation was known in sumer between the th and the rd millennium bce and was probably known by the indians and the chinese people before the sumerians the egyptians had trade routes through the red sea importing spices from the land of punt east africa and from arabia evolution of indian trade networks the main map shows the routes since mughal times inset a shows the major prehistorical cultural currents b premauryan routes c mauryan routes d routes c st century ce and e the z shaped region of developed roads maritime trade began with safer coastal trade and evolved with the manipulation of the monsoon winds soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the arabian sea and the bay of bengal south asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to southeast asia thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult indian connections to various southeast asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes by making use of the maritime trade routes bulk commodity trade became possible for the romans in the nd century bce a roman trading vessel could span the mediterranean in a month at onesixtieth the cost of overland routes visible trade routesedit the peninsula of anatolia lay on the commercial land routes to europe from asia as well as the sea route from the mediterranean to the black sea records from the th century bce attest to the existence of an assyrian merchant colony at kanesh in cappadocia now in modern turkey trading networks of the old world included the grand trunk road of india and the incense road of arabia a transportation network consisting of hardsurfaced highways using concrete made from volcanic ash and lime was built by the romans as early as  bce during the times of the censor appius claudius caecus parts of the mediterranean world roman britain tigriseuphrates river system and north africa fell under the reach of this network at some point of their history according to robert allen denemark  the spread of urban trading networks and their extension along the persian gulf and eastern mediterranean created a complex molecular structure of regional foci so that as well as the zonation of core and periphery originally created around mesopotamia there was a series of interacting civilizations mesopotamia egypt the indus valley then also syria central anatolia hittites and the aegean minoans and mycenaeans beyond this was a margin which included not only temperate areas such as europe but the dry steppe corridor of central asia this was truly a world system even though it occupied only a restricted portion of the western old world whilst each civilization emphasized its ideological autonomy all were identifiably part of a common world of interacting components these routes  spreading religion trade and technology  have historically been vital to the growth of urban civilization the extent of development of cities and the level of their integration into a larger world system has often been attributed to their position in various active transport networks historic trade routesedit combined land and waterway routesedit incense routeedit the economy of the kingdom of qataban light blue was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including frankincense and myrrh these were exported to the mediterranean india and abyssinia where they were greatly prized by many cultures using camels on routes through arabia and to india by sea main article incense route the incense route served as a channel for trading of indian arabian and east asian goods the incense trade flourished from south arabia to the mediterranean between roughly the rd century bce to the nd century ce this trade was crucial to the economy of yemen and the frankincense and myrrh trees were seen as a source of wealth by the its rulers ptolemy ii philadelphus emperor of ptolemaic egypt may have forged an alliance with the lihyanites in order to secure the incense route at dedan thereby rerouting the incense trade from dedan to the coast along the red sea to egypt i e s edwards connects the syroephraimite war to the desire of the israelites and the aramaeans to control the northern end of the incense route which ran up from southern arabia and could be tapped by commanding transjordan gerrha  inhabited by chaldean exiles from babylon  controlled the incense trade routes across arabia to the mediterranean and exercised control over the trading of aromatics to babylon in the st century bce the nabateans exercised control over the routes along the incense route and their hold was challenged  without success  by antigonus cyclops emperor of syria the nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions the replacement of greece by the roman empire as the administrator of the mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the east and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of the south according to milo kearney  the south arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the roman ships in the gulf of aden in response the romans destroyed aden and favored the western abyssinian coast of the red sea indian ships sailed to egypt as the maritime routes of southern asia were not under the control of a single power precolumbian tradeedit further information inca road system some similarities between the mesoamerican and the andean cultures suggest that the two regions became a part of a wider world system as a result of trade by the st millennium bce the current academic view is that the flow of goods across the andean slopes was controlled by institutions distributing locations to local groups who were then free to access them for trading this trade across the andean slopes—described sometimes as vertical trade—may have overshadowed the long distance trade between the people of the andes and the neighboring forests the callawaya herbalists traded in tropical plants between th and the th centuries while copper was dealt by specialized merchants in the peruvian valley of chincha long distance trade may have seen local elites resorting to struggle in order for manipulation and control prior to the inca dominance specialized long distance merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets copper hatchets cocoa salt etc for redistribution among the locals and were key players in the politics of the region hatchet shaped copper currency was produced by the peruvian people in order to obtain valuables from pre columbian ecuador a maritime exchange system stretched from the west coast of mexico to southernmost peru trading mostly in spondylus which represented rain and fertility and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the inca empire spondylus was used in elite rituals and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the andes during the prehispanic times predominantly overland routesedit silk roadedit main article silk road trading routes used around the st century ce centred on the silk road the silk road was one of the first trade routes to join the eastern and the western worlds according to vadime elisseeff  along the silk roads technology traveled ideas were exchanged and friendship and understanding between east and west were experienced for the first time on a large scale easterners were exposed to western ideas and lifestyles and westerners too learned about eastern culture and its spiritualityoriented cosmology buddhism as an eastern religion received international attention through the silk roads cultural interactions patronized often by powerful emperors such as kanishka led to development of art due to introduction of a rich variety of influences buddhist missions thrived along the silk roads partly due to the conducive intermixing of trade and cultural values which created a series of safe stoppages for both the pilgrims and the traders among the frequented routes of the silk route was the burmese route extending from bhamo which served as a path for marco polos visit to yunnan and indian buddhist missions to canton in order to establish buddhist monasteries this route  often under the presence of hostile tribes  also finds mention in the works of rashidaldin hamadani grand trunk roadedit for centuries the grand trunk road has served as the main artery for travel across northern india a scene from the ambala cantonment during the days of the british raj main article grand trunk road the grand trunk road  connecting chittagong in bangladesh to peshawar in pakistan  has existed for over two and a half millennia one of the important trade routes of the world this road has been a strategic artery with fortresses halting posts wells post offices milestones and other facilities part of this road through pakistan also coincided with the silk road this highway has been associated with emperors chandragupta maurya and sher shah suri the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the upkeep of the road emperor sher shah widened and realigned the road to other routes and provided approximately  roadside inns through his empire these inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status the british occupation of this road was of special significance for the british raj in india bridges pathways and newer inns were constructed by the british for the first thirtyseven years of their reign since the occupation of punjab in  the british followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes and at some places the newer routes ran parallel to the older routes vadime elisseeff  comments on the grand trunk road along this road marched not only the mighty armies of conquerors but also the caravans of traders scholars artists and common folk together with people moved ideas languages customs and cultures not just in one but in both directions at different meeting places  permanent as well as temporary  people of different origins and from different cultural backgrounds professing different faiths and creeds eating different foods wearing different clothes and speaking different languages and dialects would meet one another peacefully they would understand one anothers food dress manner and etiquette and even borrow words phrases idioms and at times whole languages from others amber roadedit main article amber road the amber road was a european trade route associated with the trade and transport of amber amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the mediterranean before the establishment of roman control over areas such as pannonia the amber road was virtually the only route available for long distance trade towns along the amber road began to rise steadily during the st century ce despite the troop movements under titus flavius vespasianus and his son titus flavius domitianus under the reign of tiberius caesar augustus the amber road was straightened and paved according to the prevailing urban standards roman towns began to appear along the road initially founded near the site of celtic oppida the rd century saw the danube river become the principal artery of trade eclipsing the amber road and other commercial routes the redirection of investment to the danubian forts saw the towns along the amber road growing slowly though yet retaining their prosperity the prolonged struggle between the romans and the barbarians further left its mark on the towns along the amber road via marisedit the via maris purple kings highway red and other ancient levantine trade routes c  bce main article via maris via maris literally latin for the way of the sea was an ancient highway used by the romans and the crusaders the states controlling the via maris were in a position to grant access for trade to their own citizens and collect tolls from the outsiders to maintain the trade route the name via maris is a latin translation of a hebrew phrase related to isaiah due to the biblical significance of this ancient route many attempts to find its presentday location have been made by christian pilgrims thcentury traveler and pilgrim burchard of mount zion refers to the via maris route as a way leading along the shore of the sea of galilee trans saharan tradeedit main article transsaharan trade saharan trade routes circa  with the modern territory of niger highlighted tuareg people who exercised influence over the trans saharan trade early muslim writings confirm that the people of west africa operated a sophisticated network of trade usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved african areas were in place before islam further strengthened trade towns and government in western africa the capital court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar abū ubayd abd allāh albakrī the mainstay of the trans saharan trade was gold and salt the powerful saharan tribes berber in origin and later adapting to muslim and arab cultures controlled the channels to western africa by making efficient use of horsedrawn vehicles and pack animals the songhai engaged in a struggle against the sadi dynasty of morocco over the control of the trans saharan trade resulting in damage on both sides and a weak moroccan victory further strengthening the uninvolved saharan tribes struggles and disturbances continued till the th century by which the mandé merchants were trading with the hausa between lake chad and the niger newer trade routes developed following extension of trade predominantly maritime routesedit romanindia routesedit main article roman trade with india roman trade with india according to the periplus maris erythraei st century ce the ptolemaic dynasty had initiated grecoroman maritime trade contact with india using the red sea ports the roman historian strabo mentions a vast increase in trade following the roman annexation of egypt indicating that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time by the time of augustus up to  ships were setting sail every year from myos hormos to india trading in a diverse variety of goods arsinoe berenice troglodytica and myos hormos were the principal roman ports involved in this maritime trading network while the indian ports included barbaricum barygaza muziris and arikamedu the indians were present in alexandria and the christian and jewish settlers from rome continued to live in india long after the fall of the roman empire which resulted in romes loss of the red sea ports previously used to secure trade with india by the grecoroman world since the time of the ptolemaic dynasty hanseatic tradeedit main article hanseatic league main trading routes of the hanseatic league shortly before the th century the germans played a relatively modest role in the north european trade however this was to change with the development of hanseatic trade as a result of which german traders became prominent in the baltic and the north sea regions following the death of eric vi of denmark german forces attacked and sacked denmark bringing with them artisans and merchants under the new administration which controlled the hansa regions during the third quarter of the th century the hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties economic conflict with the flanders and hostilities with denmark these events led to the formation of an organized association of hanseatic towns which replaced the earlier union of german merchants this new hansa of the towns aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade was prominent for the next hundred and fifty years philippe dollinger associates the downfall of the hansa to a new alliance between lübeck hamburg and bremen which outshadowed the older institution he further sets the date of dissolution of the hansa at  and concludes that the hansa was almost entirely forgotten by the end of the th century scholar georg friedrich sartorius published the first monograph

connected scandinavia kievan rus and the byzantine empire the route allowed traders along the route to establish a direct prosperous trade with byzantium and prompted some of them to settle in the territories of presentday belarus russia and ukraine the route began in scandinavian trading centres such as birka hedeby and gotland crossed the baltic sea entered the gulf of finland followed the neva river into the lake ladoga then it followed the volkhov river upstream past the towns of staraya ladoga and velikiy novgorod crossed lake ilmen and up the lovat river from there ships had to be portaged to the dnieper river near gnezdovo a second route from the baltic to the dnieper was along the western dvina daugava between the lovat and the dnieper in the smolensk region and along the kasplya river to gnezdovo along the dnieper the route crossed several major rapids and passed through kiev and after entering the black sea followed its west coast to constantinople maritime republics mediterranean tradeedit further information maritime republics genoese red and venetian green maritime trade routes in the mediterranean the economic growth of europe around the year  together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes eased the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the mediterranean the growing independence of some coastal cities gave them a leading role in this commerce maritime republics italian repubbliche marinare of venice genoa amalfi pisa and republic of ragusa developed their own empires in the mediterranean shores from the th

malindi to sail across the indian ocean to calicut the wealth of the indies was now open for the europeans to explore the portuguese empire was one of the early european empires to grow from spice trade modern routesedit the modern times saw development of newer means of transport and often controversial free trade agreements which altered the political and logistical approach prevalent during the middle ages newer means of transport led to the establishment of new routes and countries opened up borders to allow trade in mutually agreed goods as per the prevailing free trade agreement some old trading route were reopened during the modern times although in different political and logistical scenarios the entry of harmful foreign pollutants by the way of trade routes has been a cause of alarm during the modern times a conservative estimate stresses that future damages from harmful animal and plant diseases may be as high as  billion us dollars in the absence of effective measures to prevent the introduction of unwanted pests through various trade routes wagonway routesedit main article wagonway networks like the santa fe trail and the oregon trail became prominent in the united states with wagon trains gaining popularity as a mode of long distance overland transportation for both people and goods the oregoncalifornia routes were highly organized with planned rendezvous locations and essential supplies the settlers in the united states used these wagon trains  sometimes made up of  of more conestoga wagons  for westward emigration during the th and the th centuries among the challenges faced by the wagon route operators were crossing rivers mountains and hostile native americans preparations were also made according to the weather and protection of trade and travelers was ensured by a few guards on horseback wagon freighting was also essential to american growth until it was replaced by the railroad and the truck railway routesedit main article railway route of the first american transcontinental railroad from sacramento california to council bluffs iowa the  railway act of england compelled at least one train to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a penny a mile trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes had the ability to travel to other towns frequently suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards the british constructed a vast railway network in india but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose in addition to the commercial purpose the efficient use of rail routes helped in the unification of the united states of america the modern times saw nations struggle for the control of rail routes the transsiberian railway was intended to be used by the russian government for control of manchuria and later china the german forces wanted to establish berlinbaghdad railway in order to influence the near east and the austrian government planned a route from vienna to salonika for control of the balkans according to the encyclopædia britannica  railroads reached their maturity in the early th century as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the industrialized countries of the world by the midth century however they had lost their preeminent position the private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips while the airplane had usurped it for longdistance travel especially in the united states railroads remained effective however for transporting people in highvolume situations such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs and mediumdistance travel of less than about  miles between urban centres although railroads have lost much of the generalfreightcarrying business to semitrailer trucks they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal grain chemicals and ore over long distances the development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds in addition the introduction of piggyback flatcars in which truck trailers are transported long distances on speciallydesigned cars has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking modern road networksedit main article road highcapacity freeway interchange in los angeles california usa the advent motor vehicles created a demand for better use of highways roads evolved into two way roads expressways freeways and tollways during the modern times existing roads were developed and highways were designed according to intended use trucks came into widespread use in the western world during world war i and quickly gained reputation as a means of long distance transportation of goods modern highways such as the transcanada highway highway  australia and panamerican highway allowed transport of goods and services across great distances automobiles continue to play a crucial role in the economies of the industrialized countries resulting in rise of businesses such as motor freight operation and truck transportation the emission rate for cars using highways has been on a decline between  and  due to regulations and the introduction of unleaded petrol this trend is especially notable since there has been a growth in vehicles and vehicle miles traveled by automobiles using these highways modern maritime routesedit further information ship transport and shipping lane canals in the us circa  a consistent shift from land based trade to sea based trade has been recorded since the last three millennia the strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with other parts of the world easily modern maritime trade routes  sometimes in the form of artificial canals like the suez canal  had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations the opening of the suez canal altered british interactions with the colonies of the british empire as the dynamics of transportation trade and communication had now changed drastically other waterways like the panama canal played an important role in the histories of many nations inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities eg grains coal and ore waterway commerce was historically important to europe particularly to russia according to the encyclopædia britannica  russia has been a significant beneficiary not only have inland waterways opened vast areas of its interior to development but moscowlinked to the white baltic black caspian and azov seas by canals and rivershas become a major inland port oil spills are recorded both in case of maritime routes and pipeline

modern society people have come to use air transport both for long and middle distances with the average route length of long distances being  kilometers in europe and  kilometers in the us this industry annually carries  billion passengers worldwide covers a  million kilometer network and has an annual turnover of  billion dollars this mode of transportation links national international and global economies making it vital to many other industries newer trends of liberalization of trade have fostered routes among nations bound by agreements one such example the american open skies policy led to greater openness in many international markets but some international restrictions have survived even during the present times express delivery through international cargo airlines touched us  billion in  and according to the world trade organization is expected to triple in  in   pure cargoservice companies operated internationally air transport particularly favors light expensive and small products electronic media rather than books for example and refined drugs rather than bulk food pipeline networksedit main article pipeline transport route of the bakutbilisiceyhan pipeline the economic importance of pipeline transport  responsible for a high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation  is often undermined by the general public due to the lack of visibility of this mode generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport this mode has many advantages over rival modes such as trucks and railways examples of modern pipeline transport include alashankoudushanzi crude oil pipeline and iranarmenia natural gas pipeline international pipeline transport projects like the bakutbilisiceyhan pipeline presently connect modern nation states—in this case azerbaijan georgia and turkey—through pipeline networks in some select cases pipelines can even transport solids such as coal and other minerals over long distances short

huntergathererfishers using flint technology sweden is first described in a written source in germania by tacitus in  ad in germania  and  he mentions the swedes suiones as a powerful tribe distinguished not merely for their arms and men but for their powerful fleets with ships that had a prow at each end longships which kings kuningaz ruled these suiones is unknown but norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semilegendary kings going back to the last centuries bc as for literacy in sweden itself the runic script was in use among the south scandinavian elite by at

mainly travelled east and south going to finland the baltic countries russia belarus ukraine the black sea and even as far as baghdad their routes passed through the dnieper south to constantinople on which they carried out numerous raids the byzantine emperor theophilos noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard known as the varangian guard the swedish vikings called rus are believed to be the founding fathers of kievan rus the arab traveller ibn fadlan described these vikings as follows i have seen the rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the itil i have never seen more perfect physical specimens tall as date palms blond and ruddy they wear neither tunics nor caftans but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free each man has an axe a sword and a knife and keeps each by him at all times the swords are broad and grooved of frankish sort ales stones the actions of these swedish vikings are commemorated on many runestones in sweden such as the greece runestones and the varangian runestones there was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards which are

to have ruled both svealand sweden and götaland gothia as one province beginning with eric the victorious sweden and gothia were two separate nations long before that into antiquity it is not known how long they existed the epic poem beowulf describes semilegendary swedishgeatish wars in the th century götaland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of östergötland east gothia and västergötland west gothia the island of gotland was disputed by other than swedes at this time danish hanseatic and gotlanddomestic småland was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests and only the city of kalmar with its castle was of importance the southwest parts of the scandinavian peninsula consisted of three danish provinces scania blekinge and halland north of halland denmark had a direct border to norway and its province bohuslän but there were swedish settlements in southwest finland and along the southern coastline of norrland gamla uppsala old uppsala a site of religious and political importance in the early days of sweden during the early stages of the scandinavian viking age ystad in danish province scania and paviken on gotland were flourishing centres of trade but they were not parts of the early swedish kingdom remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from – ad have been found in ystad in paviken an important centre of trade in the baltic region during the th and th century remains have been found of a large viking age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries between  and  trade brought an abundance of silver to gotland and according to some scholars the gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of scandinavia combined st ansgar is usually credited with introducing christianity in  but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the th century during the th century christianity became the most prevalent religion and from  sweden is counted as a christian nation the period between  and  was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the nordic kingdoms in the years – according to the legend of eric ix and the eric chronicles and swedish kings made first second and third crusade to pagan finland against finns tavastians and karelians and started conflicts with the rus with who no longer had any connection with sweden the swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of finland started at the same time in th and th century in th century swedish colonisation of coastal areas of finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of finland were inhabitet mostly by swedes except for the provinces of scania blekinge and halland in the southwest of the scandinavian peninsula which were parts of the kingdom of denmark during this time feudalism never developed in sweden as it did in the rest of europe the peasantry therefore remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of swedish history slavery also called thralldom was not common in sweden and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of christianity the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the baltic sea and by the development of cities before the th century indeed both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of king magnus iv in  former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became labourers in the towns still sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange for instance the farmers of the province of dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of sweden and exchange it there for iron which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish which they consumed while the iron would be shipped abroad a romantic nationalist interpretation of valdemar iv taking control over gotland the final battle outside the walls of visby in  ended with a massacre of  defenders of the city in the middle of the th century sweden was struck by the black death the population of sweden and most of europe was seriously decimated and the population at same territory as existed by  did not reach the same numbers again until the beginning of the th century one third of the population died during – during this period the swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by german merchants of the hanseatic league active especially at visby in  sweden and norway were united under king magnus eriksson and in  queen margaret i of denmark effected the personal union of sweden norway and denmark through the kalmar union however margarets successors whose rule was also centred in denmark were unable to control the swedish nobility a large number of children inherited the swedish crown over the course of the kingdoms existence consequently real power was held for long periods by regents notably those of the sture family chosen by the swedish parliament king christian ii of denmark who asserted his claim to sweden by force of arms ordered a massacre in  of swedish nobles in stockholm this came to be known as the stockholm blood bath and stirred the swedish nobility to new resistance and on  june now swedens national holiday in  they made gustav vasa their king this is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern sweden shortly afterwards he rejected catholicism and led sweden into the protestant reformation the hanseatic league had been officially formed at lübeck on the baltic coast of northern germany in  the hanseatic league sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the baltic sea in exchange they offered a certain amount of protection having their own navy the hansa were able to sweep the baltic sea free of pirates the privileges obtained by the hansa included assurances that only hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located they sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes with these concessions lübeck merchants flocked to stockholm where they soon came to dominate the citys economic life and made the port city of stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of sweden under the hanseatic trade twothirds of stockholms imports consisted of textiles and onethird of salt the main exports from sweden were iron and copper however the swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the hansa mostly german citizens and to resent the income they felt they lost to the hansa consequently when gustav vasa or gustav i broke the monopoly power of the hanseatic league he was regarded as a hero by the swedish people history now views gustav i as the father of the modern swedish nation the foundations laid by gustav would take time to develop furthermore when sweden did develop freed itself from the hanseatic league and entered its golden era the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal

union between sweden and norway during the th century sweden emerged as a european great power before the emergence of the swedish empire sweden was a poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of european civilisation with no significant power or reputation sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king gustavus adolphus seizing territories from russia and poland–lithuania in multiple conflicts including the thirty years war during the thirty years war sweden conquered approximately half of the holy roman states gustav adolphus planned to become the new holy roman emperor ruling over a united scandinavia and the holy roman states but he died at the battle of lützen in  after the battle of nördlingen swedens only significant military defeat of the war proswedish sentiment among the german states faded these german provinces excluded themselves from swedish power one by one leaving sweden with only a few northern german territories swedish pomerania bremenverden and wismar stockholm in midth century in the middle of the th century sweden was the thirdlargest country in europe by land area only surpassed by russia and spain sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of charles x after the treaty of roskilde in  the foundation of swedens success during this period is credited to gustav is major changes to the swedish economy in the th century and his introduction of protestantism in the th century sweden was engaged in many wars for example with the polish–lithuanian commonwealth with both sides competing for territories of todays baltic states with the disastrous battle of kircholm being one of the highlights onethird of the finnish population died in the devastating famine that struck the country in  famine also hit sweden killing roughly  of swedens population the swedes conducted a series of invasions into the polish–lithuanian commonwealth known as the deluge after more than half a century of almost constant warfare the swedish economy had deteriorated it became the lifetime task of charles son charles xi to rebuild the economy and refit the army his legacy to his son the coming ruler of sweden charles xii was one of the finest arsenals in the world a large standing army and a great fleet swedens largest threat at this time russia had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training death of gustav ii adolf at the battle of lützen after the battle of narva in  one of the first battles of the great northern war the russian army was so severely devastated that sweden had an open chance to invade russia however charles did not pursue the russian army instead turning against poland–lithuania and defeating the polish king augustus ii and his saxon allies at the battle of klissow in  this gave russia time to rebuild and modernise its army after the success of invading poland charles decided to make an attempt at invading russia but this ended in a decisive russian victory at the battle of poltava in  after a long march exposed to cossack raids the russian tsar peter the greats scorchedearth techniques and the extremely cold winter of  the swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the russian army at poltava the defeat meant the beginning of the end for the swedish empire in addition the plague raging in east central europe devastated the swedish dominions and reached central sweden in  the battle of poltava in  in the years following poltava russia and her allies occupied all the swedish dominions on the baltic coast and even finland charles xii attempted to invade norway in  but he was shot dead at fredriksten fortress in  the swedes were not militarily defeated at fredriksten but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the kings death and the army withdrew forced to cede large areas of land in the treaty of nystad in  sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the baltic sea with swedens lost influence russia emerged as an empire and became one of europes dominant nations as the war finally ended in  sweden had lost an estimated  men  of those from the area of presentday sweden and  from the finnish part of sweden in the th century sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside scandinavia and most of them were lost culminating with the loss in  of eastern sweden to russia which became the highly autonomous grand principality of finland in imperial russia in interest of reestablishing swedish dominance in the baltic sea sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor france in the napoleonic wars swedens role in the battle of leipzig gave it the authority to force denmark–norway an ally of france to cede norway to the king of sweden on  january  in exchange for northern german provinces at the treaty of kiel the norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the swedish king charles xiii he launched a military campaign against norway on  july  ending in the convention of moss which forced norway into a personal union with

these innovations included governmentsponsored programmes of enclosure aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands and the introduction of new crops such as the potato because the swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in europe the swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in swedish politics which has continued through modern times with modern agrarian party now called the centre party between  and  sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today strong grassroots movements sprung up in sweden during the latter half of the th century trade unions temperance groups and independent religious groups creating a strong foundation of democratic principles in  the swedish social democratic party was founded these movements precipitated swedens migration into a modern parliamentary democracy achieved by the time of world war i as the industrial revolution progressed during the th century people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions a communist revolution was avoided in  following the reintroduction of parliamentarism and the country was democratised world war i and world war ii main articles sweden during world war i and sweden during world war ii sweden was officially neutral during world war i although under german pressure they did take steps which were detrimental to the allied powers including mining the øresund channel thus closing it to allied shipping and allowing the germans to use swedish facilities and the swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies sweden also allowed volunteers fighting for the white guards together with the germans against the reds and russians in the finnish civil war and briefly occupied the aland islands

soviet occupation as in the first world war sweden remained officially neutral during world war ii although its neutrality during world war ii has been disputed sweden was under german influence for much of the war as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades the swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest germany and therefore made some concessions sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to germany throughout the war however sweden supported norwegian resistance and in  helped rescue danish jews from deportation to nazi concentration camps the swedish government also unofficially supported finland in the winter war and the continuation war by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to finland during the last year of the war sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees among them several thousand jews from nazioccupied europe were rescued thanks to the swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because sweden served as a haven for refugees primarily from the nordic countries and the baltic states the swedish diplomat raoul wallenberg and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of hungarian jews nevertheless both swedes and others have argued that sweden could have done more to oppose the nazis war efforts even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation

highest point is kebnekaise at  m  ft above sea level sweden has  provinces or landskap landscapes based on culture geography and history while these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose they play an important role in peoples selfidentity the provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands parts the northern norrland the central svealand and southern götaland the sparsely populated norrland encompasses almost  of the country sweden also has the vindelfjällen nature reserve one of the largest protected areas in europe totaling  ha approx  km about  of sweden lies north of the arctic circle southern sweden is predominantly agricultural with increasing forest coverage northward around  of swedens total land area is covered with forests the highest population density is in the öresund region in southern sweden along the western coast up to central bohuslän and in the valley of lake mälaren and stockholm gotland and öland are swedens largest islands vänern and vättern are its largest lakes vänern is the third largest in europe after lake ladoga and lake onega in russia combined with the third and fourth largest lakes mälaren and hjälmaren these lakes take up a significant part of the southern swedens area swedens extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the göta canal in the th century shortening the potential distance between the baltic sea south of norrköping and gothenburg by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal climate köppen climate classification types of sweden most of sweden has a temperate climate despite its northern latitude with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year the winter in the far south is usually weak and is only manifested through some shorter periods with snow and subzero temperatures autumn may well turn into spring there without a distinct period of winter the country can be divided into three types of climate the southernmost part has an oceanic climate the central part has a humid continental climate and the northernmost part has a subarctic climate however sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude and even somewhat farther south mainly because of the combination of the gulf stream and the general west wind drift caused by the direction of planet earths rotation continental westcoasts to which entire scandinavia belongs as the westernmost part of the euraisian continent are notably warmer than continental eastcoasts this can also be seen by comparing fi the canadian cities of vancouver and halifax nova scotia with each other the winter at west coast vancouver is the much milder one and for example central and southern sweden has much milder winters than many parts of russia canada and the northern united states because of its high latitude the length of daylight varies greatly north of the arctic circle the sun never sets for part of each summer and it never rises for part of each winter in the capital stockholm daylight lasts for more than  hours in late june but only around  hours in late december sweden receives between  and  hours of sunshine annually during july are the temperature difference between north and south not large with exception of the mountains has the entire country a julyaverage temperature within the range of  c to   c a difference of  degrees while the januaryaverage temperatures varies between the freezing point down to below  c along the border to finland a difference of  degrees the scandinavian mountains the highest temperature ever recorded in sweden was  °c  °f in målilla in  while the coldest temperature ever recorded was − °c − °f in vuoggatjålme in  temperatures expected in sweden are heavily influenced by the large fennoscandian landmass as well as continental europe and western russia which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to sweden that in turn renders most of swedens southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby british isles even matching temperatures found along the continental atlantic coast as far south as in northern spain in winter however the same highpressure systems sometimes puts the entire country far below freezing temperatures there is some maritime moderation from the atlantic which renders the swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby russia even though temperature patterns differ between north and south the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudal differences this is due to the south being surrounded by a greater mass of water with the wider baltic sea and the atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the southwest apart from the icefree atlantic bringing marine air into sweden tempering winters the mildness is further explained by prevailing lowpressure systems postponing winter with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover by the time winter finally breaks through daylight hours rise quickly ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring with the greater number of clear nights frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as april the cold winters occur when lowpressure systems are weaker an example is that the coldest ever month january  in stockholm was also the sunniest january month on record the relative strength of low and highpressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers when hot continental air hits the country the long days and short nights frequently bring temperatures up to  °c  °f or above even in coastal areas nights normally remain cool especially in inland areas coastal areas can see socalled tropical nights above  °c  °f occur due to the moderating sea influence during warmer summers summers can be cool especially in the north of the country transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the fourseason climate applies to most of swedens territory except in scania where some years do not record a meteorological winter see table below or in the high lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist on average most of sweden receives between  and  mm  and  in of precipitation each year making it considerably drier than the global average the southwestern part of the country receives more precipitation between  and  mm  and  in and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to  mm  in despite northerly locations southern and central sweden may have almost no snow in some winters most of sweden is located in the rain shadow of the scandinavian mountains through norway and northwest sweden the blocking of cool and wet air in summer as well as the greater landmass leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country with quite warm summers at the bothnia bay coast at  degrees latitude

fundamental laws swedish grundlagar which together forms the constitution the instrument of government swedish regeringsformen the act of succession swedish successionsordningen the freedom of the press act swedish tryckfrihetsförordningen and the fundamental law on freedom of expression swedish yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen the public sector in sweden is divided into two parts the legal person known as the state swedish statenb and local authoritiesc the latter includes regional county councils swedish landsting and local municipalities swedish kommuner the local authorities rather than the state make up the larger part of the public sector in sweden county councils and municipalities are independent of one another the former merely covers a larger geographical area than the latter the local authorities have selfrule as mandated by the constitution and their own tax base notwithstanding their selfrule local authorities are nevertheless in practice interdependent upon the state as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction is specified in the local government act swedish kommunallagen passed by the riksdag sweden is a constitutional monarchy and king carl xvi gustaf is the head of state but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions under the provisions of the  instrument of government the king lacks any formal political power the king opens the annual riksdag session chairs the special council held during a change of government holds regular information councils with the prime minister and the government chairs the meetings of the advisory council on foreign affairs swedish utrikesnämnden and receives letters of credence of foreign ambassadors to sweden and signs those of swedish ambassadors sent abroad in addition the king pays state visits abroad and receives those incoming as host apart from strictly official duties the king and the other members of royal family undertake a variety of unofficial and other representative duties within sweden and abroad legislative power is vested in the unicameral riksdag with  members general elections are held every four years on the second sunday of september legislation may be initiated by the government or by members of the riksdag members are elected on the basis of proportional representation to a fouryear term the internal workings of the riksdag is in addition to the instrument of government regulated by the riksdag act swedish riksdagsordningen the fundamental laws can be altered by the riksdag alone only an absolute majority with two separate votes separated by a general election in between is required rosenbad in central stockholm has been the seat of the government since  the government swedish regeringen operates as a collegial body with collective responsibility and consists of the prime minister — appointed and dismissed by the speaker of the riksdag following an actual vote in the riksdag before an appointment can be made — and other cabinet ministers swedish statsråd appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister the government is the supreme executive authority and is responsible for its actions to the riksdag most of the state administrative authorities swedish statliga förvaltningsmyndigheter report to the government including but not limited to the armed forces the enforcement authority the national library the swedish police and the tax agency a unique feature of swedish state administration is that individual cabinet ministers do not bear any individual ministerial responsibility for the performance of the agencies within their portfolio as the directorgenerals and other heads of government agencies reports directly to the government as a whole and individual ministers are prohibited to interfere thus the origin of the pejorative in swedish political parlance term ministerstyre english ministerial rule in matters that are to be handled by the individual agencies unless otherwise specifically provided for in law the judiciary is independent from the riksdag government and other state administrative authorities the role of judicial review of legislation is not practised by the courts instead the council on legislation gives nonbinding opinions on legality there is no stare decisis in that courts are not bound by precedent although it is influential political parties and elections the riksdag chamber at the time of a vote in  the swedish social democratic party has played a leading role in swedish politics since  after the reformists had confirmed their strength and the leftwing revolutionaries formed their own party after  most governments have been dominated by the social democrats only five general elections since world war ii—    and —have given the assembled bloc of centreright parties enough seats in the riksdag to form a government for over  years sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the riksdag—the social democrats the moderate party the centre party the liberal peoples party and the left party—before the green party became the sixth party in the  election in the  election while the greens lost their seats two new parties gained seats for the first time the christian democrats and new democracy the  election saw the return of the greens and the demise of new democracy it was not until elections in  that an eighth party the sweden democrats gained riksdag seats in the elections to the european parliament parties who have failed to pass the riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue the june list – the pirate party – and feminist initiative –present the party leaders lined up before the start of the televised live debate on  september  in the  general election the moderate party formed the centreright alliance for sweden bloc and won a majority of the riksdag seats in the  general election the alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the social democrats the greens and the left party the alliance won a plurality of  seats but remained two seats short of a seat majority nevertheless neither the alliance nor the left block chose to form a coalition with the sweden democrats the outcome of the  general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centreleft parties in comparison to the centreright alliance for sweden with the two blocs receiving  and  seats respectively the nonaligned sweden democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining  seats on  october  stefan löfven formed a minority government consisting of the social democrats and the greens election turnout in sweden has always been high by international comparison although it declined in recent decades the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout  in   in   in  and  in  swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the s however that level of confidence has since declined steadily and is now at a markedly lower level than in its scandinavian neighbours administrative divisions main articles counties of sweden and municipalities of

regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government each county administrative boards is led by a county governor swedish landshövding appointed for a term of six years the list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back in most cases to  when the counties were created by lord high chancellor count axel oxenstierna the main responsibility of the county administrative board is to coordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the riksdag and government there are older historical divisions primarily the twentyfive provinces and three lands which still retain cultural significance further information subdivisions of sweden and national areas of sweden political history kingdoms of svear sweonas and götar geats in the th century with modern borders in grey the actual age of the kingdom of sweden is unknown establishing the age depends mostly on whether sweden should be considered a nation when the svear sweonas ruled svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the svear and the götar geats of götaland being united under one ruler in the first case svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year  by tacitus but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way however historians usually start the line of swedish monarchs from when svealand and götaland were ruled under the same king namely eric the victorious geat and his son olof skötkonung in the th century these events are often described as the consolidation of sweden although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later earlier kings for which no reliable historical sources exist can be read about in mythical kings of sweden and semilegendary kings of sweden many of these kings are only mentioned in various saga and blend with norse mythology the title sveriges och götes konung was last used for gustaf i of sweden after which the title became king of sweden of the goths and of the wends sveriges götes och vendes konung in official documentation up until the beginning of the s all laws in sweden were introduced with the words we the king of sweden of the goths and wends this title was used up until  the present king of sweden carl xvi gustaf was the first monarch officially proclaimed king of sweden sveriges konung with no additional peoples mentioned in his title the term riksdag was used for the first time in the s although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as  in the town of arboga during the riksdag assemblies of  and  under king gustav vasa representatives of all four estates of the realm clergy nobility townsmen and peasants were called on to participate for the first time the monarchy became hereditary in  executive power was historically shared between the king and an aristocratic privy council until  followed by the kings autocratic rule initiated by the commoner estates of the riksdag as a reaction to the failed great northern war a parliamentary system was introduced in  followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in   and  the latter granting several civil liberties already during the first of those three periods the era of liberty – the swedish rikstag had developed into a very active parliament and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century in  sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament with the first chamber indirectly elected by local governments and the second chamber directly elected in national elections every four years in  the parliament became unicameral legislative power was symbolically shared between the king and the riksdag until  swedish taxation is controlled by the riksdag swedish prime minister stefan

states of the european union throughout the th century swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of nonalignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime swedens government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war swedens doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the swedish campaign against norway in  during world war ii sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers this has sometimes been disputed since in effect sweden allowed in select cases the nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods especially iron ore from mines in northern sweden which was vital to the german war machine however sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of finland in the winter war and permitted the training of norwegian and danish troops in sweden after  development aid measured in gni in  source oecd as a percentage sweden is the largest donor during the early cold war era sweden combined its policy of nonalignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security

october  a whiskeyclass submarine u  from the soviet union ran aground close to the naval base at karlskrona in the southern part of the country research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against swedish military potential the incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between sweden and the soviet union the  assassination of olof palme and with the end of the cold war sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach nevertheless the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget since  sweden has been a member of the european union and as a consequence of a new world security situation the countrys foreign policy
