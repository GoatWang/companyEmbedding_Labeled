product enables digitised teaching    am cest send by mail  last name  name  from  to  you can enter multiple email addresses separated by commas message  required fields  years ago swisscom launched its internet for schools initiative today all swiss schools benefit from free secure internet access as a result it guarantees that pupils can use the internet safely protected from cybercrime and inappropriate content however schools now face new challenges the internet is no longer only a means of visual instruction it is increasingly becoming a work area whole teaching modules are only available online pupils and teachers also use the net for research communication and saving documents a lack of standardisation and alternatives mean that reports and other confidential data are often saved through providers that operate servers in the usa swisscom has now taken internet for schools to the next level to offer schools everything for secure online teaching communication and data storage vastly increased speed digital homework book schools now have free access to speeds of up to  mbits or the maximum speed available at any site by  swisscom will provide all swiss communities with fibreoptic technology ensuring that even remote areas have access to ultrafast broadband a free licence for classroom videoconferencing is also included so pupils in hospital can continue to follow lessons via skype for instance it also lets experts easily join in teaching in the virtual classroom in many countries these live insights into practical worlds of experience are already the order of the day letting practitioners and experts demonstrate the theory taught in class swisscom also supplies schools with a free basic version of helloclass with data storage in switzerland helloclass digitises homework books weekly timetables and letters to parents thus creating a secure and very userfriendly platform for communication and planning so there is no longer any need for telephone chains letters announcing deadlines or sending timetables information is always accessible and cannot be lost today helloclass is already used in more than  classes in addition swisscom offers schools a discountprice cloud for data storage in switzerland  for certificates school reports or tests for instance as michael in albon head of internet for schools and media skills expert explains information technology doesnt tend to be a subject in its own right nowadays is simply part of teaching  just as it is a natural part of our working lives now this is a radical change and sooner or later pupils will end up only working with tablets or notebooks this in turn requires very different capacities which we provide to schools for free many fartherreaching solutions are intended mainly for school administrations whom we have long supported in their journey into the digital future says michael in albon we have now standardised solutions for the most common demands making them less expensive easier and more readily available support for schools continues in addition to supporting schools with technology swisscom also constantly updates its medienstark media skills initiative which provides training for teachers and parents as well as pupils as of this year it is also possible to book a version compatible with curriculum  which fits in with new structural requirements michael in albon computers smartphones digital technologies  they have all completely changed our daily lives over the past  years and so its only logical and necessary that schools change too we hope that our contribution will help make implementing change smooth secure and straightforward the services provided over the past  years are worth a total of half a billion swiss francs in monetary terms in the future schools will continue to enjoy free services worth around chf  million annually swisscom ag published this content on  may  and is solely responsible for the

schmid louis the floor is yours louis schmid good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to swisscoms first quarter results presentation  my name is louis schmid head of investor relations and with me are our ceo urs schaeppi and mario rossi our chief financial officer the first part of todays analyst and investor presentation hosted our ceo consist of three chapters a quick overview of q highlights our market and financial performance then some explanations on swisscom switzerland and finally an update on fastweb in the second part of the presentation mario runs you through the financials and the unchanged guidance for the fullyear  with that i would like to hand over to urs to start his part of the presentation on slide  urs urs schaeppi yes good morning ladies and gentlemen if you go to slide  you can see that we have a solid start into the year so on the branding side we are really the trusted brand in switzerland on innovation we made a lot of innovation just as an example we increased our coverage for g plus and we also launched a new product which i will come later to it we were able to keep our strong and leading position in the retail market although we have the same dynamics as in the last quarters in the retail markets enterprise market we have a very solid and strong positioning a bit lighter solution basis in q but overall a good performance also in the enterprise business fastweb strong results in the q and if you look to the revenue evolution youll see that overall we have a flat revenue evolution i will come later to with some details to it so overall a good first quarter a solid financial situation we also confirmed our a ratings and we have unchanged guidance for  if you go on slide  youll see the market performance of swisscom easy said its good and solid we were able to defend our strong market position even in a market which is becoming more and more competitive if you take as an example our evolution in the broadband business you see that we have a stable broadband business  million connections and the net adds are lets say stable or minus  and the main reasons behind is that smes who are on the cost pressure optimized their broadband connection thats one the dynamics there in the market is saturated and on the other side we have the cps migration or allip migration so even in such an environment we were able to have a stable broadband business and also good kpis in the broadband business im optimistic of the performance of broadband in the next quarters because within  one our new quadrupleplay offer we will gain more momentum then we have the further rollout of our ultra broadband footprint and we see that in areas where we have an ultrabroadband footprint we have better figures and also our swisscom tv products is strong and clearly indiscernible so im optimistic for the future on the development of the broadband here you will see that we were able to grow also on mobile postpaid solid kpis a good market performance and a small growth in a saturated market on the fixed voice business you see that the substitution of the fixed lines which we already saw in the last year is continuing and we have a loss of  fixed line connections and this is substitution thats actually not lost to competition fastweb has a good evolution you see it on the right side of the slide a good net adds in the first quarter the financial performance on slide  if i can begin with the net revenue you see the net revenue is declining by chf million but if you go deeper in it you can see that more than  of this decline is driven by oneoffs this is mainly an exchange rate effect and second its hard to a business theres always a bit of seasonality in it so the real decline in the service revenue is much lower and the reason that the service revenue is slightly coming back is the voice line loss and the impact of roaming on the right side you see the ebitda actually a stable or flat situation in ebitda compared to the previous year and if you go deeper into it from switzerland you see that the loss on the ebitda level is chf million and chf million is coming from roaming chf million is coming from the loss of fixed lines and then through cost savings we could compensate this decline on the service revenue so as a result we have this minus chf million ebitda in swisscom switzerland if you go on slide  you will see that we have solid market shares and we will continue to defend these market shares in mobile we have  broadband if you change  or if you include also the wholesale market shares we have  market share on that and on tv a growing market share of  slide  shows you that we continue to invest in our networks in q we had  million households which are connected with ultra broadband which have speed above  megabits and we have  million out of which has a speed above  megabits per second so increasing fast an increasing footprint in our ultra broadband network in wireless were also building out our networks we have  g coverage we have g coverage above  and this leads to speeds up to  megabits per second and this shows our leading position in the  also in the mobile market on the right side of the chart just some remarks to chip test the test is the marketing instrument of switzerland where a lot of competitors do the marketing of a test we dont see our company on a test but there are some tests which shows you that  there are a lot of tests where swisscom is the winner and it shows that swisscom has a leading infrastructure and well do the necessary things to keep ahead on this infrastructure competition if you go on slide  youll see what we have done to manage our market performance to differentiate our project portfolio in  in march we launched a new offer for wingo mobile sales plan a very competitive offer on the price level for the more price sensitive markets where we have a good starting and also good sales figures in april we launched our quadrupleplay offer or fixed mobile converged offer i will come later it and also a multidevice proposition page  shows you the performance wireless performance in the retail market so a solid postpaid momentum arpu was up stable churn stable long churn figures in the postpaid markets and a good momentum on bundling on the left side of the chart you see that we have  million postpaid customers out of that  are infinity customers and  are again bundles of these postpaid customers the arpu is overall  same with the blended arpu more or less stable infinity arpu is slightly going back some remarks to it that is due to the mix  due to a mix because infinity is still a bit growing and then lower infinity customers are coming in the clusters thats the main effects if i look deep to the infinity customer base we see a stable arpu in the infinity customer base so its mainly acquisitiondriven mixdriven so overall revenue in the mobile market is stable and we were able to compensate the impact of roaming if you go on slide  you see the wireline performance in the retail market and there we have a mixed picture tv which is growing on a yearonyear level of  broadband we have a growth of  yearonyear and then the dynamics or the change which we have already last year is in the voice line business where we have a decline on a yearly level yearonyear of  and this is a substitution mainly substitution and consolidation the good news is that the arpu is stable and we have also introduced the ticker average revenue per households which you see here on the bottom line of this figure i think that the kpi which is becoming more and more important in a more converged market overall the service revenue is chf so minus  the overall minus chf million and the main effect is the voice line bundling is growing good momentum in the bundling business on page  you see the performance in the converged market so bundles went up by volume by  on a yearonyear level the top line is growing by chf million so we have a good and strong momentum in the converged business on the left side of the chart you see the subscription and the bundling in q we have  million bundles tripleplay or fixed mobile converged bundles and from the mobile revenue generating units  are in this so it shows that theres still a lot of content to increase the mobile penetration and the bundle in the middle of the page you see that the arpu of our bundles is slightly going down because also of a mix effect of the new subscription so if penetration is low then we get lower charge in it thats a mix effect and from impacts on growing and then some impacts out of the voice line these are the main reasons of the arpu evolution but overall growing revenue with bundles on page  you see some explanation to our new offers our new price line inone so the market is becoming more and more converged we are in a mature market in switzerland and we have a market lets call it everybody offers everything so we see this clear trend to a converged market and also the customer is asking for it so the customer is asking for more converged offers is asking for flexibility and value for money the strategy of swisscom in this market is valueoriented approach we dont want to decrease our prices our ambition is to maintain the price levels and the philosophy behind inone is more for more and what we are doing with our new offering one we are combining our flagship offers vivo thats a indiscernible with our infinity offer and then its a bundle discount on the top on slide  you see the structure of this new price plan its a multilevel concept and then you can pick out different bundles lets say a large bundle on mobile a medium bundle on the internet and then also a large bundle on tv according to your demands or your desires and if youre bundling even more mobile you see it on the right side of the chart at the bottom you see as more mobile you put in in the bundle the higher is the monthly benefit you get with this approach we will be able to increase our mobile penetration to household on slide  you see why we are doing this we want to defend our leading position in the swiss markets we want to get an instrument where we can do upselling and crossselling and at the end we will be able to increase our share of wallet with the flexibility of the bundles we will be able to increase the net promoter score and also reduce the churn on the lower end of the market which is actually already low in summarizing the last three marks on this slide if you take the households which have a swisscom broadband connection you can see that more than  million in these households has the mobile with operators and this shows actually the potential to increase the penetration of mobile to our inone offering slide  gives you a short overview of our enterprise business on the right side you see that we have a value proposition which is very strong so we are really the only fully integrated operator we have strong ict capabilities and we can really offer converged ict offers in a market which is becoming more cloudbased and this shows our strong positioning in the bb market the revenue in the bb market is  was in  approximately chf billion and from this chf billion approximately  of the revenue is coming out of the telecommunication business wireless and wireline other  is coming out of the solutions business and there we have different business units we have vertical solutions as an example for the banking we have cloud solutions we have workplace solutions so it shows a strong solutions portfolio with  and with a midterm potential to grow and then the last  of the revenue is more hardwaredriven or others business the enterprise developments on slide  you see that we have stable revenuegenerating units in the bb market which shows our strong performance in the bb market we were able to increase the revenuegenerating unit in the mobile market despite some aggressive price moves of competitors and this leads to an overall stable arpu development the decline in the voice business is mainly driven through consolidation and ip migration the service revenue is overall flat on a yearonyear base we lost chf million so its more or less flat its developed under the service revenue and the solutions revenue is slightly lighter in q and there are actually two effects one is we have always some seasonality in the projects business in the bb market and on the other side we have the price pressure last year with some projects in the workplace and collaboration area thats why the revenue in q is a bit lower but midterm we have potential to grow in the solutions business if you go on slide  actually the message of this slide is we are on track with our processing so we will deliver this chf million cost reduction and there we have a broad program to increase the efficiency to reduce cost or improve quality on slide  some remarks to fastweb so we continue to increase our ultra broadband footprint in italy and our target is to have in  a footprint of  million households with more than  gigabit per second speed we will have a footprint of  million households with approximately  megabits and  million with the speed lets say between  and  megabits so we will have a good ultra broadband footprint and we are on track with our plans slide  shows you our market performance of fastweb in the broadband business if you take the market share of the broadband connections you can see that we were able to increase our market share slightly and also on the revenue side we are able to increase our revenue market share in the broadband business the performance of the net ads in q is good so we were able to grow also compared to the q in  so overall a good market momentum of fastweb slide  shows you the wireless performance we launched successfully our new g offer  of the new customers are buying a bundled offer mobile and wireline and we see in this converged offer a lower churn by  point so lower churn through a converged offering fastweb corporate performance on slide  so also here we have an increase in revenue market share in the corporate market and we have also a very strong proposition in the corporate market and therefore we are optimistic to have the good development in the corporate market also in the next quarters slide  shows the financial performance solid performance  more revenue  higher ebitda and a positive free cash flow and so we confirm our expectation on the financial development of fastweb so i would like now to hand over to mario rossi for the financials mario mario rossi thank you urs from my side a few additional remarks on the financials you have seen the result in new segment reporting switzerland now consists of three segments thats retail customers enterprise customers and wholesale network and other you received the restated numbers one week ago in order to fill you excel sheets and your new models ill start then on page  with some remarks on revenue in the three spaces the retail revenue declined by  and stand there at chf billion for the first quarter the decline comes mainly from service revenue there we saw chf million there we saw a flat development in wireless even a slight increase of chf million compared to prior year and we lost chf million on wireline chf million came from the fixed line loss then you have two additional effects we dont charge anymore for the tv activation fees and indiscernible fees the bundle discounts the total effect is booked on wireline the enterprise business saw reduced revenues by  it lands at chf million revenues for the first quarter the indiscernible evolution on service revenue is chf million  comes from fixed  from mobile and mobile is the impact of the roaming and urs mentioned we have kind of weak start in the solutions business revenue is chf million compared to the prior year then especially we had some weak start in the ucc workplace business as you see a slow evolution of the pbx business i think that can be attributed to the allip migration as many customers wait for these projects until they get full visibility what that will mean for their operation on the wholesale business there we have two effects less revenues from ntr an ntr reduction among the mobile operators chf million thats compensated by additional income in roaming revenues of about chf million i think fastweb urs explained that the client saw an increase in the consumer segment a bit like q in the bb segment but that has something to do with seasonality on the opex on page  on the direct costs sacsrc there we have three different effects we have higher box worth chf million first of all we changed the model in  related to tv boxes theyre now booked as opex that touching the first quarter impact of chf million then we have higher subsidies of chf million and then you have less wireless sacsrcs of chf million because we have less retention cases you remember last year we had extremely high retention number in swiss business on both goods and purchase goods purchased had doubled first we had lower mtrs and lower international voice termination fees and then because of the lower hardware revenues of course we had also lowered related to the hardware business on the indirect costs as urs mentioned we are on track to deliver the chf million you see also in q we are able to reduce the headcount in switzerland at approximately  ftes ebitda in switzerland we lost  ebitda we stayed there at chf million but we were able to keep the ebitda margin at a solid  i would say approximately  of the pressure on topline service revenue were compensated by cost reductions in swiss business fastweb clearly benefits from the revenue increase and have stable costs in the cost we have two effects one is higher subscriber acquisition cost because we have a higher number of client customers and second one is we have a change in the regulated prices in the indiscernible booked in q the low ebitda and ebit i think there are two points to mention lower interest expenses the standard chf million we will see further savings in the future in mid of july theres a € million bond with a coupon of  so we are more than confident that we will create some savings on this side then on the tax rate you see here in q a high tax rate of  compared to expected one of  we have two effects in q adjustment of the prior year tax loss in swiss business of chf million then you have chf million corrections of prior year assessment for the year  to  allocation of profits to different indiscernible but again tax rate longterm will remain at  on page  on capex only one remark we had lets say low capex activity in the fttx environment in switzerland its just seasonal reasons we had a very cold january which created limitations to the construction activities in switzerland so we will invest in the fiber area as expected around chf million in  page  on the operating free cash flow theres nothing special in q in switzerland you remember last year we had this payment of chf million for the adsl case this case is still pending as i said on the call we dont know when we will be assigned a decision net debt at q stands at chf billion which is  below prior year and finally coming to the outlook as mentioned the outlook is unchanged so four main drivers for the decrease in the ebitda level in the swiss business was line loss chf million roaming chf million price pressure and other about chf million compensated partially by savings of about chf million after q i would expect a bit higher impact from the fixed line loss and a bit lower impact from the roaming business at fastweb in italy we are confident that we will meet our growth targets on revenue and ebitda and with that i would like to hand over to louis for qa louis schmid the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you louis operator instructions simon coles barclays your question please simon coles hi simon coles from barclays thank you for taking the question so the first one i guess is on your recent pricing changes i guess its a bit early but just wondering if you could give us any information about how traction is going for your new inone products and whether youve seen any change in competition some pricing changes from your competitors and secondly in the enterprise segment we saw rgus improve this quarter but service revenues declined i guess thats a function of the mix change but is there also arpu pressure from competition going on there weve seen a competitor announced that they clearly want to be better in that part of the market thank you very much urs schaeppi on our new offer inone its a bit early to really have a good understanding but what we see is actually a good take up and we see a good momentum on mobile we see that its going from  but its too early really to say how the dynamics will be because in the beginning you have always build another dynamics in midterm a bit too early but we dont see really big deviations to what we planned and then on the enterprise market development of the service revenue overall the development in the service revenue in our enterprise space is  its quite safe so we were able to grow on the subscription side on mobile we have the impact on roaming on the mobile and stable development in the fixed business so what we see is in some customers we see very aggressive moves from our competitors who try to enter the market but up to now if youve seen the development of our market shares we are in a good and stable position but the price aggressiveness is there simon coles thats very clear thank you very much unidentified analyst yes thanks i have couple of questions staying with inone propositions when you launched you talked about initial pressure on bundled arpu due to rightgrading however since then sunrise has also launched their quadplay proposition at discount and so could also enter the fixed end market so what makes you confident that the arpu pressure will not be that severe and you will be able to still see upselling at a later stage and secondly at fastweb youre having clearly a good success in mobile with g launch and bundling services but at some point you will also have increasing competition with iliad coming in mobile what makes you confident that the converged strategy can still drive growth and also can i clarify what was the ebitda growth this quarter excluding the regulatory changes at fastweb and there shouldnt be any further regulatory benefit rest of the year thank you urs schaeppi i will take the question of inone and mario will come down to fastweb if you go on our offer on page  you see that the idea of our inone offer and with the flexible approach we are also flexible in matching different price points because not every customer needs  giga a lot of customers are more than happy with the lets say with  to  megabit per second so i think with our offer in inone our salespeople have the ability to really react on different customers and to offer them an attractive price point and then with the advantage of mobile we will be able to really offer an attractive proposition for the household and as i mentioned it in our broadband household footprint more than  million mobiles are not with swisscom so there is a potential to upsell and then you have also a potential to upsell if we increase our ultra broadband footprint so we can upsell customers who are achieving for speed we can upsell them and they get more results from ultra so i think we have the instruments to react flexible on the mobile market and its a bit too early to say how successful the converged offer of sunrise will be and i dont see on our side a huge impact indiscernible and its too early to say how salt will launch the fixed market but i think we have a solid positioning to defend our market position mario rossi and on the italian business but first of all we are happy with the move of our customers to the network of telecom italia and the ability that it can deliver g to our customers then with this offer i think we preempt the business mobile offer we kind of  through kind of preempt and often expect it in the upmark management and thats also mentioned in his presentation if you see that now already at the very early stage that the  of new customers are willing to buy mobile and wireline and as we mentioned several times indiscernible might be very fast in delivering mobile services but delivering fixed line services as we all know it takes a little bit long and i think during this period there is attractive bundle offers were able to further grow our customer base and then that combined with the fiber rollout that we see longer term i think thats a sustainable strategy to defend against the market entrants of indiscernible and on the financials we have an ebitda increase of chf million compared to q  around chf million comes from a oneoff for prior years we dont see any additional positive impact in the remaining three quarters but as i mentioned we have also higher subscriber acquisition cost because of a high number of customers that compensate more or less the oneoff from regulatory points unidentified analyst thats very helpful thank you operator thank you next question is from frederic boulan frederic boulan hi good morning a couple of questions please first of all to followup on the enterprise side we saw ebitda worsening quite sharply in q if you could discuss a little bit the dynamics youre seeing here is this temporary is this driven by the solutions trends and what we should expect for the rest of the year and secondly if you could talk a little bit about your segmentation were seeing quite a lot of activity on your side with wingo in particular in the last year or so are you seeing any change in dynamics here between your core and discount brands or you still have a very solid segmentation and then maybe if i may on inone i know its quite early day but what do you expect will be the dynamics between the standalone price increases youve actually implemented versus the strat of people in bundling for instance telephony or benefiting from some of our discounts and getting a discount versus what theyre currently spending thank you urs schaeppi maybe mario can take the question on ebitda on enterprise but i will start with wingo wingo is actually  with the launch of wingo thats our lets say onlineonly mobile project we have the good stuff and what we see is that we are able to attract pricesensitive customers hence that the maturity is coming from competition but there is also some price sensitive customers from who is coming and who are going on home wingo thats clear but the majority is coming from competition therefore the approach with wingo works it works and our acquisition on our old brands with the mobile is working well and there we are on our plan so i think the multibranded approach works at this time to inone its too early really to say but clearly we will have positive effects after upselling the upselling potential we have in the tripleplay offer the share of wallet increase was mobile these are the positive effects and the other sign is that we certainly have some customers who are going to  who will optimize themselves but if were going to offer them such a indiscernible ability i think it will result in churn overall we will have lower churn and the upselling potential thats why i think we will have a better momentum with inone in the actual market condition mario rossi and on the enterprise business in q compared to prior year we lost  million on service revenue i would expect that that trend will continue on during the next three quarters more or less thats again price pressure on fixed and mobile networks and the other  i would never expect that these trends will continue on the solution business as we explained it was a weak q i think we believe we see a recovery in the next three years as was explained it was a  lets say a weak start on the project business there we see some recovery but the cost savings we saw cost savings in q compared to prior year of about  million per quarter that will continue more acceleration i would expect that overall i think well see some recovery you can do now your calculations of that would mean on ebitda level but it will be a better ebitda evolution in the next three quarters than in q of this year compared to prior year frederic boulan okay thank you very much operator thank you frederic next question jakob bluestone crédit suisse jakob bluestone hi jakob bluestone here from credit suisse just couple of shorter questions firstly just in terms of sort of customer perception as your mobile offering i guess its six months ago now that we have the connect test youve obviously had some other mobile tests since then went more your way but i was just interested has there been a shift in customer perceptions things like net promoter scores and since the connect test back in december or perception is that your mobile offering is pretty stable or sort of heading in the right direction any color you can share on that would be useful and then just secondly i didnt quite catch what was the decline in the mtr costs during the quarter i think mario ran through some of the individual cost items but i think i might have missed that thank you urs schaeppi well on the customer perception we are doing regularly a net promoter score mission we dont see an impact on our net promoter score so that awareness the perception of the networks quality is stable high and clearly above our competitors and yes thats what i can say thats what our customers are telling us and we dont  the churn problem  our churn in mobile is even lower than a yearago so we have a very stable mobile business and then in switzerland a lot of marketing is done through this test i think the test its not the whole  its not the whole reason in the market and the network of sunrise is certainly becoming better thats clear but the swisscom network is a good one you are also in switzerland so you can talk with customers mario rossi and jakob the impacts on the mtr on revenue its minus  million net revenue and then on the cost side minus  million so we have a small benefit because the indiscernible was a little bit reduced jakob bluestone can i maybe just ask one followup as well and then you reported adjusted ebitda growth slightly up i think plus  and your guidance for the fullyear is down obviously quite a lot of moving parts through the year and just actually new plans which you said initially its dilutive but then i guess you also have an easier comp later in the year as a result of the roaming drag being smaller in  than in  can you maybe just sort of give us a sense of through the years  through  which are the strong quarters which are the weaker quarters just given the fact that theres quite a few moving parts this year thank you urs schaeppi i dont think that we should do guidance per quarter jakob so i think i explained the four main drivers for the fullyear there i explained that we will see a little bit higher impact on fixed line loss bit lower impacts on roaming you have moving parts for example incoming roaming was strong this year in q also because of the key role championship in indiscernible on the other side east will be differently in q and q that relate to outbound roaming so i think we will quarterafterquarter and then we see to the fullyear guidance jakob bluestone okay fair enough thank you operator next question joshua mills joshua mills hi thank you and just a couple of questions for me on the enterprise side so just following up on the comment that the pressure in the enterprise revenues from continued heavy price pressure id be interested to know whether youre actually losing bb contract or whether that price pressure is just coming through as you offer discounts to existing customers i mean and if that is the case what kind of discounts do you end up offering to customers in order to keep them on the swisscom network the second one you talked about enterprise ebitda improving over the next few quarters i wonder if you have kind of any longerterm guidance on when you think revenues can stabilize obviously kpn is in a similar situation facing enterprise revenue pressure at the moment and they have targeted stabilization in the medium term is that something you feel you could commit to seeing the legacy declines and some growth in the new services that you see today thank you urs schaeppi on the ebitda mario can come later to it but on the development in the bb market so we dont have actually big losses in the bb market its going to take all of the customers lets take the mobile market because actually the main attacks today are coming is far in the mobile market if i took all the sim cards we increased our sim cards and then we have  our win factor ratio is a lot slow so i think we have a stable comp situation in the bb market were able to defend our position in the bb market but as you mentioned it this is always also a price driven game not only price but price discounts are important in such rfps on the other side this is always a very selective approach so thats not to all customers its only a few customers where we have this aggressive promotion so the main impact on our service revenue development in the enterprise market is driven by the roaming impact but that was the big impact we had in the last quarter that was not by price competition mario rossi and again coming back on the ebitda so in page  we showed you the distribution of the revenues and i think we should just look at the telecom business of course that has a higher margin but we are quite stable in the solution business and they are looking at this as a bundle looking at the old book we are confident that we ahead than in q  as i explained before midterm i think we are well positioned for example in the indiscernible we are well positioned to redevelop this business then also cloud cloud services i think there are midterm possibilities there to grow the business at a lower margin than the telecom business but still at a decent margin and with less capex intensity so i think that is what we can say for midterm perspective urs schaeppi yes also digital solution is the digitalization of the industry is actually a chance or a potential for swisscom because with our capabilities ict capabilities we will be able to deliver more solution but on the other side we have now some effect but midterm im optimistic on the solution base joshua mills thank you operator thank you joshua next question carola bardelli deutsche bank carola bardelli yes good morning its carola bardelli from deutsche bank thank you very much i have a couple of questions on sac if i may so i was wondering what is the average arpu that you are generating on your mobile subscribers in italy and what kind of usage in terms of giga per month and then i was wondering if we could have an indication on the margin that you expect to generate on the  million voice service contract one with the public administration and lastly if you could elaborate a little bit on your content strategy in italy going forward what you intend to do thank you very much urs schaeppi but we dont disclose the arpu and the gigabytes of mobile but those percents then you maybe can estimate that approximate with the arpu but on the margin on pa also there we dont disclose the arpu on specific customers but you see that we are able to increase our market share in the market segment of the japanese inflation and now also with the deal we made with italy we will be able to have a good and strong portfolio and position in the public administration market our content strategy in italy so we have a partnership with skype we have also the specific offers to address in march our intention is not to act quite in our indiscernible in italy mario rossi maybe carola asked if the  million is coming from the incremental revenue i think there it has a little we dont disclose margin per customer or contract but we have an average margin because of the advantage of faster bit speed that we have a strong proxelle that we dont need to run with proxelle to deliver services to the customer on that average margin you have on this  million carola bardelli okay thank you very much operator thank you next question matthijs van leijenhorst matthijs leijenhorst yes good morning ive got only  i have only one question left and how should i look at the development of the retention costs in  because its positively impacting your adjusted ebitda but what is actually happening there because what i understood is last year it was significantly higher could you give some more color on this subject urs schaeppi we had approximately  less indiscernible this year compared to the prior year but again so we had stable churn rate that means we dont have a problem with the customer base we had very high very high retention cases throughout the quarters last year so that doesnt make us nervous this trend is less retention and then you have at the low level you have the impact of increasing number of sim only customers often at swisscom we have to see multioffering in the market but its very  its at a low level but you see there an increase in impact of sim only customers but overall i would say that development as expected matthijs leijenhorst thank you very much operator next question georgios ierodiaconou georgios ierodiaconou hi thanks for taking the questions i have a couple on fastweb the first one is around  weve seen some news that you may be putting out accounts for sale and i just wanted to check with you if there would be any regulatory issues with you being involved or any other issues apart from price that may keep you from being interested in asset and then second question on fastweb is around the timing of the change of the billing dates to  i believe that was in late february is it possible  do you have an idea of what the impact it will have on your numbers going forward and whether its just in consumer or whether some of the business customers will also be affected by the billing change and then finally very quickly a question on switzerland i just wanted to get a better idea on the target plan and the logic behind it and i understand you are expecting to get a little bit more upselling in mobile and you may lose a bit more voice line what i wanted to understand is on broadband whether the improvement you expect to see is around net additions or the mix whether this is a tool for you to upsell higher speeds to the base urs schaeppi maybe i will start with inone and then mario can come to the billing cycle and regulatory environment in italy inone that i think that we will be able to keep our market share in this broadband business but the market is saturated at the end but with inone with an increasing ultra broadband footprint and the good tv products we have a decent value proposition for our customers but that the main advantage is actually coming to us in crosssell but the market is saturated so the market shares will not shift dramatically from one to other and thats why it is important to work on the share of wallet and upsell and thats the idea behind inone mario rossi and on four weeks billing theres no impact in the first half and in fact we will see the impact in the second half its only for residential customers not for the bb segment and the impact is included in the guidance as you remember we see for fastweb a similar increase of ebitda as in  in  of course except the oneoff coming from the litigation of telecom italia and around bt right now its too early to say urs schaeppi too early and lets say that i dont see any regulatory obstacles but we just look at the situation in italy and then thats what we have to say around bt georgios ierodiaconou thank you operator next question james ratzer new street research james ratzer yes good morning two questions please the first one is regarding your inone product going back to that i mean youve mentioned a few times on this call that youre kind of excited by the opportunity of around  million people in your footprint set by other mobile operators so two questions on that specifically can you give us any guidance on how you are doing so far on upselling to that part of the base but secondly whats the risk on the other side how many swisscom mobile customers do you have in particular in sunrise and salt homes  or sorry sunrise homes you could try to set upsell and target your mobile customers and then secondly just with regards to the ftth buildout from fastweb i mean youve given the  target but at the run rate you are building out it looks like you could hit that towards the end of  so as a result i was wondering if you could kind of say that you think you can hit that at  million homes two years early or do you think actually you will then maybe continue above  million and see a bigger opportunity there urs schaeppi well on inone there as i mentioned before its too early to give more details on our performance of inone but we made the calculation and we are optimistic that we can do upselling and the second question is now do we have further churn potential on mobile because in the areas where we dont have ultra broadband footprint if you go overall you have the market share of probably about  so that shows that thats already there on broadband there in a good situation for youtube player offer and with the household advantage i think we have a strong margin to gain market shares on the other side the loyalty of the mobile customers is  i think we are working on customer service on the network policy so i dont think that we will have a churn rate a big churn rate on mobile therefore james ratzer do you know how many customer you actually have in this sunrise fixed footprint urs schaeppi sunrise has a footprint which is  they can work on the footprint of swisscom thats clear because they are a wholesaler of swisscom but at the end in a quadrupleplay operate as a whole our portfolio which is important and then i think there in a good situation we have the launch of the mobile we have the advantage of the over the tv products we have a good customer service so there are a lot of arguments which  say for swisscom james ratzer okay great and then on the ftth point in italy mario rossi so if you look at the fttx so that means ultra broadband and there we stick to our target of  million by  i dont have the overall plans but if you look end of  we had  million households in the fttx area and if we indiscernible around  million per year then we reach our target in  but i dont know the exact lease negotiation between h and x h depends also on the rollout with in jvs  within flash fiber and telecom italia james ratzer but it does seem that you are running ahead of the required rate on ftth i mean so do you think you could see opportunity to increase above the  million homes urs schaeppi yes but as mario mentioned really we are on the plan we are not faster than announced james ratzer great okay thank you operator thank you james next question julio arciniegas rbc julio arciniegas yes hello thank you for taking my question two questions one regarding broadband actually for example this quarter basically the broadband net adds were negative when actually in  they were all positive can you give us more color about the competitive dynamics in the broadband market we know that for example sunrise is becoming more active do you expect this trend to change should we expect positive net ads in broadband in the coming quarters and the second question coming back to the inone you mentioned that you dont expect revenue cannibalization from this offer but can you help me to work out for example if i take that am size bundling inone is  and i believe that the previous am offer the price was higher so how come we shouldnt expect any revenue cannibalization thank you urs schaeppi on the mobile performance as i explained in q there are different elements which led to a weaker performance on the net ads this is a chart shows elements like the migration of allip where customers are doing consolidation also cps migration thats  these are the main effects and there has been more promotional activity in q but overall the performance of broadband is fine its fine though also we dont get the churn  really a churn problem in this market and with inone now we have the possibility to even accelerate it but dont think that the broadband business will be the big growth potential in a saturated market and we have a stable situation there and i think its too early as i mentioned it several times its too early to give a bit more flavor on the dynamics of inone okay operator perhaps a very last question before we finish this call operator okay your last question is saroop purewal redburn saroop purewal i just had a question on  firstly on your roaming so i kind of noticed in your packages you include roaming but i was just wondering how important that is for the fresh consumer just to have it all included and they dont have to worry about it versus sunrises approach which is just to add on roaming packages as a when and then my second question was just regarding salt and what youre expecting in terms of their fixed coverage when theyre expected to launch later this year thanks urs schaeppi okay on roaming so also in the infinity choice they have roaming included depends on the tariff plan more or less stage and what is here actually is that this really stimulates strong traffic twothird of the roaming traffic actually is done is a bundle on the other side we also with this we see also with stimulation on the roaming packages so overall the roaming volume is in data is strongly growing and on the salt the footprint i cant only make a forecast that over what would indiscernible they can take the footprint of the wholesale in  prior to the footprint in switzerland this will be approximately  of the households thats one of the possibilities and the second possibility they can come to swisscom and buy wholesale off from swisscom and then they will have a broad footprint or they will have a footprint in whole switzerland but this can do everybody in switzerland saroop purewal and have they approached you so far and if they have if those kind of talks  how those talks have gone urs schaeppi yes but they always have talks on wholesale they also  we dont disclose on the details of our talks but salt is a customer of swisscom wholesale saroop purewal sorry what was that salt is a urs schaeppi salt is a customer of our wholesale products but already today this was already the case and if salt is coming to swisscom and ask for wholesale products we would offer them we have the commercial on all of our products which everybody can buy and we would certainly offer them this product saroop purewal okay thanks very much louis schmid thank you also thanks to the operator and with that i would like to conclude todays presentation and call also thank you to all of you for

handover to martin to start his presentation martin voegeli thank you very much bart for your introduction and also a warm welcome also from my side to you as an industry leader in switzerland we see the importance of understanding future trends to which we align our strategies and actions therefore we start our day today with a little journey into the future clearly we don’t know the future but we can imagine it a little bit it’s my intention to be a little inspiration to show what beliefs we have behind our strategy work hence i use today an order format for my presentation i’m sure you will see this afternoon enough corporate slides from my colleagues i will launch you through what we believe are the most important drivers of our industry locally as well as globally doing so i’m going to point out many examples that already exist today we believe that those are good indicators of the direction our business will develop in since these strategies like to structure things having crossed my insights around four major topics first software based businesses then the internet of everything third the global competition and last but not least the changes of society which can be recognized as proof as driver and also consequence of the other things we’ll discuss in the next minutes let’s go to the first topic software based business address the first major implication of digitalization a huge part of products and services in the digital is software rather than physical goods in other words the focus shifts to the services we can consume online and the things we can do with our increasingly marked devices second software supporting also new business models especially as a smart connector between supply and demand let’s take a tremendous disruption within the hospitality and tourisms industry as an example of what software in combination with other trends such as sharing economy can do fd believes to decrease the revenues of new york’s hotel industry by  in  and even more impressive and that is the speed at which this is happening from my end it’s a good performance to add  rooms a year fd can do that within only two weeks however most of the trends also have chances coming along with them and the example of new york forecast show that another  million can be generated due to additional tourists visiting the city spending more money in restaurants or for entertainment and distributing their spending more evenly all over the place as they are not limited by the hotel location anymore another example is d printing here software comes into play because literally it builds hardware anytime at any place and practically without logistical challenges these are only some of the things that can already be printed the range goes from all sorts of technical and replacement parts over consumer goods to even parts of the human body the ear for example last year a card has been printed and in the internet you can find big industrial printers capable of printing a house within  hours just imagine what substantial impact that is going to have any many industries in the field of telecommunication we see further disruptive technologies on the broader line between software and infrastructure i would like to point out four short examples the first one is mesh networks where the connectivity network is build of devices acting as notes second is the esim the embedded sim which integrates hardware and connectivity service provider the third one is software defined anything which allows virtual network services and fourth one tactical internet which enables network for real time control instead of pure communication what does that mean in reality doctors can only be in comp calls they can do real time surgeries from anywhere in the world autonomous cars can find their way around obstacles in real time we’re well aware of the fact that some of those things imply some risks and disruption for our industry as well but at the same time we see them as chances not only to increase efficiency for swisscom but even important to discover a new generation of services which will guide our clients into the digital world let’s jump to the next section the internet of everything addresses the increase in connectivity between humans between devices and between human and devices of course these trends goes handinhand with other developments that i’m describing for example the connection between everything is a central enabler for software based services we know that the internet is already an incredible complex network with pillions of points around the planet indeed if we visualize a small part of the internet it looks like that isn’t that amazing it’s a little bit kiosks but it’s very creative and exactly this hyper connectivity will undeniably have stronger impact in the future not only because it can leverage and utilize much better but also because it’s growing exponentially in fact we believe that  of the potential things are not even connected yet so there is much more to come having said that it does not surprise that an astonishing  trillion market is seen in this field between the next  years partially because this developments resources for higher efficiency and for new revenues in almost all industries and we as swisscom will participate in our role as trust’s companion for digitalization if we speak of this huge potential we’re talking about a power of the combination the integration of people processes data and also things concrete examples our smart cards intelligent viable personnel assistance or home robotics in order to do not get into abstracts let’s see how this integration could look in real life one of our supplier illustrated that in a short film short film talking about healthcare the interaction of people processes state and things will allow the health sector to move from reactive to proactive you saw that in the film simple apps will help us to prevent or at least recognize health risks very early the internet of everything also means that within  years from every one of us will be surrounded by  communicating and interacting objects every day i guess what i’ve said before about mass network becomes a bit more tangible now all will be connected chapter  of our short journey brings us into global competition clearly digitalization happens in the internet the internet doesn’t stop at country borders therefore digital competition is necessarily global competition so let’s have a look at the global stage they’re not only surrounded by our local competitors but the peak global payers as well we’ll know that already today received them as strong forces in our digital market what we also see at the global stage are millions of little highly active and innovative people in their garages dorm rooms already developing the next big thing any even  from the next week global players in the past five years we saw some impressive examples of that how do the big successful ones compete they don’t create independent products and services for full integrated synergetic and harmonic ecosystems this allowed them to service their communities holistically and esthetically which creates strong walls around ecosystem have you tried lately to check from apple world into other world or vice versa that’s why it’s a nightmare you lost data you lost your apps and the big one has tried to really create strong walls and with all these developments the global stage becomes very dynamic it’s full loaded it’s hectic so one of the challenges in the digital is to become a room and to remain relevant in the head of clients building up the solid community that receives the services as in rich be helpful is a key success factor let’s drive our attention to the question of how innovations in this world are made are they always new and fantastic technologies are they always based on huge investments and some sort of powerful assets obviously not if we look to just these examples huber or hoober beginning the biggest personal transportation provider without every owning one car whatsapp is the biggest messaging service provider without one component of network equipment and also app i mentioned it before is the biggest accommodation provider without only owning a single room and netflix is one of the most powerful content provider without dvds or rental places anywhere in the world what this example show us is that digital innovation are only a technical thing they’re most of the time a customer focus service of a business model and based on the simple and available technology and those things can be developed with very little resources and deployed with incredible scale and the big players know that most of the innovation comes from the small houses shown before so they constantly watch out to acquire these businesses to keep their innovation hedging up and running interesting to know that google integrates a new business in their ecosystem every  days i personally think that the ways service are invented developed and placed in the market can teach us at swisscom a lot about our future business as well and finally the changes in society again we see as proof as sources and also consequences of the other things we’ve been talking about today’s kids grow up with digital tools and media they learn to use devices and handle digitalization incredibly fast i’ve seen kids playing with ipads before they learn how to speak it’s very easy for them needless to mention that these kids grow up as true digital natives you don’t need to physically attend courses at university anymore to get a degree that also implies that every run from everywhere on the planet can be the teacher be it a professor at harvard or startup entrepreneur in south korea language issues will not exist in the digital world anymore our communication services will be smart enough to translate everything in real time that also means that we can work from everywhere at the time we refer with the colleagues and the networks we chose and of course for various businesses and clients imagine you covering the telecommunication industry on a global level independently not being employed by your company or rather writing reports for all sorts of businesses around the world clearly from home being recommended and rated by the community that brings me to the end of this little trip into the future what are the key takeaways in my opinion of you we’ve seen the software as the basis for digital world that is an essential driver of huge developments with this cost to scope and impact of the internet of everything which i believe can be as profound as the invention of the steam engine we had a look at the global stage and recognized as global not local players dominate the peak ecosystems but innovation is not only driven by big players and global players don’t act as a local companion into digitalization and last but not least we got a taste of how education working and living will be influenced by the big chances that the utilization brings along the trends are changing people’s behavior and the society as a whole clearly there are also additional megatrends which will have an important influence on our market environment for example the collaborative economy or in other words the power of the crowd the aging of the society or for example the personalization of services based on data insights all of these trends will come into future for swisscom it is very important that we also reflect the signals of these trends and get our own view of the future as a base for our business activity today i hope these thoughts had some inspiring points and could give you a little insight of how we see the industry dynamics and the bigger picture let me now handover to our ceo urs schaeppi who will explain our vision in the context of our beliefs and who will lead us through the swisscom strategy thank you for your attention urs schaeppi thank you martin and also a warm welcome here in the windy area i would like to present to you a very short the main pillars of our strategy and as martin mentioned before the route or the idea of our strategies really to be the companion of our customer in this digital world where we see a lot of opportunities for a company like swisscom and what are the  really the main pillars of our ambition in this world it’s quite simple building up the best infrastructure have excellent networks in the wireline and wireless area then deliver a superior experience that means simple products better customer service and the search pillar of our strategy is to go in new areas in areas where we can grow where we can create new business because you know it’s better than our traditional business has a price decrease and so we’ve to look for new basis so that’s the main idea of our strategy and i would like to give you now the main pillars our strategic topics where we’re working on you see it on this slide it’s structured by infrastructure by experience and then by this growth opportunities and first going to the infrastructure what is our ambition and what are our projects on the infrastructure level so our ambition is to have the best coverage the best ultra band coverage in our networks and you can see it on the wireline site today we’ve a population coverage of  and our ambition is to increase this coverage and also the speed in our mobile networks in  we want to have  population coverage with a speed of up to  megabits per second at the end of this year we’ll have lt plus to lt advanced in our networks already today if you have the right handset we’re delivering  megabits per second at the end of this year we’ll have  megabits per second in our network it always needs the right handset and this is also clear really that you must be in an optimal position but already today if you’re travelling around in switzerland you have excellent on the mobile network if you’re travelling from berne to zurich on the highway and if you measure the speed with your iphone you have  megabits per second you’ve test here in zurich of  megabit per second and this shows actually the potential of our broadband network so speed and coverage in our mobile network is a key pillar the second topic of our ultra broadband strategy it’s clearly it’s the ultra broadband wireline network today we’ve  million customer which have ultra broadband connections at the end of this year we’ll have  million households which has fiber to the home connections and our ambition for the year  is to have  ultra broadband coverage that means a coverage above  megabits per second so key pillar of our power strategy the second key pillar in the infrastructure area for our strategy is cloud we’re convinced that the business the technical business models but also the product business models are going in cloud based solution that’s why we invest in this cloud business and also for ourselves our ambition is to bring  of our application in a way through it world in the cloud or in the cloud of swisscom we’ll have products cloud products public cloud private cloud but also hybrid cloud and i guess that’s the advantage of swisscom in this cloud business we’re a local player the datas are in switzerland which gives us a differentiator and then cloud project is always an integration project where you need local footprint where you need local engineering capabilities and that’s the strength of swisscom and that’s why we’re convinced that we can differentiate us to the global players which are also delivering cloud products cloud is also one of the big growth opportunities into future if we go to the product side or experience side for a company like swisscom it’s important that we keeps relevant to our customers that means we must deliver relevant internet services where we can bring a local value add and this we do with examples in the communication area ie that’s our communication and draft application we’ve now  million downloads we’ll work on it that it will increase small plant that’s growing in the entertainment area we’re very successful with our tv product tv  it’s a cloud based product on android on an android base and after several months after the launch we’ve already  customs on this product and we’re really gaining market share so it’s not only the product that is also convergent to the mobile world which is important that you’ve a seamless experience between your big screen at home your mobile or your pda a search chance for an operator like swisscom is also for advertising area as a local player we’ve datas we’ve assets to really make advertising much more targeted much more personalized and that’s why we’re investing in such areas one of this company is local dot ch it’s a search and find company where we do advertising targeted advertising for sme market and then the diverse pillar of our internet strategy as we call it my digital life that’s actually let’s say you see as it a big picture it’s your avatar or it’s my day if you go in a small picture and we’ve their first products doc save for example and we’ll bring a lot of new products in this area in the future years so internet is a differentiator for operator like swisscom then another very strategic important pillar in our business is enabling layer we’re convinced and it’s not a miracle it’s quite clear we’re convinced that the business is delayering we’ll have an infrastructure layer we’ll have an enabling layer and above there will be a lot of companies who are delivering software services software as a service and our ambition is to create an enabling layer with different building plugs where software companies can create quite easily new products and this will bring more load to our network and will increase our shares our market shares into core business of connectivity and there are elements the elements of search and enabling layer is security as we have it with our mobile id mobile id is a secure sim card where you get a really trustful access to the digital world or big datas we have a lot of very interesting project on big data where you can really make the world more intelligent you can make smart city and all such things certainly also into payment and billing area and operator bring some capabilities with it and then a very important point are these apis where we see a big potential to really improve our enabling layer so enabling layer is an important part we’ve to create also an ecosystem behind it a developer community customer service is very very brief it’s crucial for a company like swisscom each inhabitant of switzerland has a product from swisscom if we don’t perform in the customer service we’ve a problem if we perform in customer service we’ve better revenues high loyalty so that’s really a part where we’ve to try each day to become better then on growth it’s a quite short term the biggest growth lever for a company like swisscom is the bundling if we’re able to increase the market share of our bundles we increase the share of wallet with our customer and then if we’re even able to have a small up sell marc will come to it to later on these bundles that’s really the area where we get a big impact in the next two years so bundling is a key pillar of our work on the wireline triple play but also on the mobile site where the base of this bundling is infinity another area where we can grow in a digital world are the verticals in the bb world there is a lot of potential to create it revenues and if we take banking for example which is an important vertical of swisscom we’re the market leader in banking it solutions in switzerland we’re doing there bpos business process outsourcing but we’re also into area of back office solution or front end solution and the market is really changing the banking industry is changing to digital bank but also to the huge pressure of regulation in the banking market leads to a lot of opportunities for us as an it provider healthcare long term healthcare is a huge potential for a company like swisscom it will not fast moving but long term it’s a big opportunity also if you look to all the variables which are coming to the hospitals and connection between doctors it’s really let’s say stone age normalized paper no it in it so a big potential for us energy is also a market where we can grow and therefore we’ve a vertical in the imaging area some words to fastweb it we’re unhappy with the development of fastweb last year they outperformed the market and i’m convinced that we can create additional value with fastweb and it’s not our intention that we sell fastweb we want to develop fastweb and you see i’ll come later to it you will see what are the main pillars of the strategy of fastweb so also important is network network quality ultra broadband network in italy our ambition is to go up to  footprint ultra broadband network having partnerships is important for a company like fastweb to get scale that will come also later to it but also and that’s a very important initiative for fastweb in this year is to improve the service quality increased net promoter score if you want to do this we have actually a huge transformation project before us i always tell the example if you look to the revenue structure of swisscom and if you go  years back we’re doing much more than  of our revenues with products which happened  years ago that shows actually the transformation of our company and we’re going much more in a software oriented business that’s another company software company and telecom is not the same and that’s why we need transformation project in our company on the technology side their robust work is all it all it infrastructure apis but also on the personal side and on scale side and therefore we’ve there a program on corporate level to accelerate the transformation of swisscom so the summary of the strategy is quite simple of the best infrastructure deliver excellent product and excellent custom service and then invest in the right growth opportunities now let me say some words to the revenue development and ebitda development it was a very successful year  for swisscom we were able to grow by  million on revenue and you can see it on the slide the main growth is coming out of the bundling business so good performance on the revenue side we were also in a good way we were able to increase our ebitda by  million you see that a lot of this ebitda increase is coming out of the service revenue with our bundling business so we’ve about  million ebitda is coming out of this bundling business we had because we had quite an intensive competition certainly in the fourth quarter or so in the handset market in the mobile market also a bit correlated with the launch of iphone  we had quite high subscriber acquisition costs but the good news of it is these customs are retained for  and not each month there is a new iphone  so we’re quite happy that apple has innovation process which is a bit slower than one of samsung but good success with ebitda also if you look to the different quarters and to previous years see that we had a growth in the fourth quarter the growth is not there because of these higher socks but overall the dynamic the main pillar also in q were strong so now i’d like to handover to marc our head of residential to give you some more details marc werner thanks urs you’ll had gave me some notes i’ve to talk about i guess for example network for example service leadership for example bundling on it and i’ll do my best to talk about some notes about this at this point good afternoon ladies and gentlemen in my previous role i was in marketing and sales head of marketing and sales and also head of service department that’s why i tried to talk a little bit about satisfying customers and why happy customers  make swisscom happy and hopefully also make investors happy i’d like to in my first part talk a few minutes about our current performance and how our focus on bundling and investment in network and touch upon the excellent payoff and the second part will be a few moments to tell you how we’ll deliver in the future goals from continued focus on bundling on innovations and on cost excellence of costs bundling focus and investment payoff to see all the demands in the point we continue to grow in our wireline and in our wireless business responding by k we used in  despite separated markets and new market and place for example last year centering the mobile market in switzerland in wireline these goals is driven by the tv business as the ceo already mentioned also we had increased the tv customers from  million to  million during  in my view an excellent growth and also in broadband we had an increase by  and we could offset declining voice lines by  our market share in mobile business continues to grow at the same time we see a positive shift from the prepaid to postpaid which added to k use in our mobile business also we see various developments growth in tv business as i mentioned where we managed  about a quarter to market it gives us the opportunity to be the biggest paid tv provider in switzerland in  for the first time archives still are going very strong by the bundling performance we had increased in  from  million to  million  sorry from  million to  million archives in bundle in  almost  of all archives are all bundles and if leaving out mobile then its  of all archives of all id bundles  bundles obviously means for us low return less metered revenue and since you’re bundling in some new innovative services like for example tv  we’ve a higher customer satisfaction on our bundling customers then we had it before in a nutshell bundlers for our customers but bundles are also very good for us at swisscom a strong contribution goes about k bundles archives is coming from tv as i mentioned  but whole id  of new tv subscriptions are in the bundle i’m very happy about that that bundling success in tv and broadband continues and we see also encouraging brand the same brand in fixed voice and in the mobile business in  we launched a new marketing leading tv product called tv  with some very interesting features like for example day replay or for example up to  hours recording in the cloud hence as the ceo mentioned since we launched indiscernible we had  customers on this new product it means you can calculate by yourself that it means per day  customers since we launched the product and that for us i guess for switzerland it’s really a huge performance and then right before christmas we started our new content product it’s called teleclub play it’s a kind of a netflix product to mention like this if you don’t find any content on the tv  that’s quite rare because you have  hours content already on your tv for online tv  because you have about  channels same day replay makes about  content it’s already here but even if you don’t find anything on this content you have teleclub play and since we launched in christmas we had engaged in a couple of weeks to about more than  customers we are very happy about this because of course tv product the platform the features are very important but the most important stuff still on the tv business is a content you watch on your tv and not the features this tv market has been growing in switzerland  by  swisscom increased by  that means little bit strange it’s even more than the total market and the total market has  of all paid subscribers we got during this that’s the idea as i mentioned before for the first time also the biggest paid tv digital provider it means  was net paid share in  and tv  is not just a huge success on a subscription base it’s also a huge success on the customer satisfaction having almost all aspects the better customer satisfaction than we had before with the previous tv product and that’s very important for us because that means tv makes our customer happier but tv makes also our customer more fitness as ceo mentioned that for us very very important is the network of course even as i’m for the consumer business the network is very important and that’s especially for the fiber business particularly we chose  in  about  of all customers who are connected to fiber indiscernible also took fiber and that’s an increase from  to  from about  points we see a strong momentum in the french part of switzerland in the fiber business for example we had a growth in indiscernible from about  during one year or in geneva almost  also in  geneva is also the city is to pick is the most access customer we have in switzerland is about  fiber customers already followed by  is about  but also in the german part we grew a lot in  more than  in zurich more than  in winterthur that’s very important for us of course because as ceo mentioned we invested a lot in the fiber business and we have to grow this on subscriber base and you could also see that we still grow in archives in the city obviously migrating some legacy customers to the fiber network that’s for sure but overall we have been able to increase the market share in all the cities we have already the fiber network our mobile investments are also paying and for the x it was on the chart from  i was particularly mentioned for the six times in the row we won the connect test for the best mobile network in switzerland and for the first time we even won for the best mobile network in the dutch region in  that’s a real big success and our cto is also in the room thank you very much and that’s really a big success for you and your team that’s for the sixth time in a row we won the connect test and as mentioned before we have about  lte population we have started lte you mentioned the right mobile phone you need to have the mobile phone and i did test by myself that’s my mobile phone my plus mobile phone is a g plus and samsung and with this phone you are really able to have download speed from about  megs i did it myself in no time it works i know it i did it myself and it’s a great experience to have more  megs on your mobile phone touch phone the increase to cost channel experience for our customer in  with several internal initiative and it seems really to be a big customer need when we look at that the quantity of customer which have several contexts several touch phones different contexts this number is increasingly very fast in the last  months for example customers they have some interactions with the call center and email visit their website and today we are able to know the customer better and to give him the service he wants to he doesn’t has to explain a several times on several touch phones what’s the need or what’s the problem he had and switzerland remains still more service focused than european neighbors service availability service quality in shops and in our call center are still key pillars to justify the premium price or arpu as we have in swisscom all that swisscom shops i don’t know ladies and gentlemen if he knows swisscom shop nearby there is one yes nearby there is one and that still a big key differentiator visàvis our existing competitors and also potential new entrants if you have the possibility go to swisscom shop and i’m sure you know what i’m talking about it’s also very impressing that every customer interaction for example a shop as i mentioned but also a call center interaction increase our customer satisfaction dramatically so while we obviously incur costs with an interaction it pays off for us as it makes customer less likely to return it means really if the customer has an interaction results if he mention the customer satisfaction before and after that interaction the customer satisfaction after the interaction even if he called us because of the problem its customer satisfaction is higher than before and that’s i guess not really normal and it’s because of the quality of our service the quality of our touch phone future growth many of you focus as i mentioned arpu increase is still coming from the customers who migrate from non infinity to infinity that still the main driver for the arpu increase but of course on the lower scale because declining migrations it means we will continue to create even more attractive infinity tariffs to continue to migration to infinity but also from infinity to higher infinity subscription tariff for example this was mentioned before included some digital live product or included some roaming revenues as we piloted for example last summer the inclusion of the metered revenues component reduces of course the overall volatility of our revenue also this year or last year we started to optimize our legal portfolio and we managed to shift  subscribers to the new bundle we managed to increase the arpu not a lot but we managed to increase the arpu by  swiss francs it seems not to be so much but we achieve that without a negative arpu normally if have a new product as we had with infinity couple of years ago you have the net effect as the customer optimized themselves and with the learning we had with infinity we changed the strategy in the wireline business and thats why we didn’t have any arpu decrease we had even arpu increase swiss francs for us a big success because we learned from our ability in the past and we did much better and it works future goals from mainly focusing strong customer satisfaction we had also introduced a couple of new tariffs in our entry and medium level segment thats the product we have for the entry and medium level segment we introduced for example a price plan a couple of weeks ago it’s called one and we increased the sales on weekly basis with this price plan by  that means we have now on this price plan about   customers per week a huge success for this brand and we also have a strong customer satisfaction in the entry segment with our brand and merchant that this customer satisfaction is much higher than the customer satisfaction with our main competitors given increase in preparation of core markets need to deep into financially attractive adjacent industry to grow revenues potential ceo mentioned one market for example has market for us quite important and will be much more important in the future it is important suite population benefits from an increase in the high edge more than  of those born today expected to become more than  years old in switzerland and if i get these figures i am quite happy that i am born little bit earlier to be honest in fact more indiscernible small fast moving companies and we have more than  international and swiss acquisitions since this venture established  last but not least we have to talk about cost and about the all ip program that’s quite important program for us because we have to target until the end of  that we migrate all our customers on the all ip infrastructure in  we had a growth there from almost  that means we migrated from  customers to almost  customers during  months and in  almost all new products were produced on ip for example tv  was the biggest natural driver for all ip migration that means the people wants the product and if they’re not already on all ip they have to change on all ip and because they want the product there is no big pain behind the migration because we all know its not so easy to migrate from the past infrastructure to all ip but even there we learned a lot in the last couple of months and for example we decreased the contact activation by  which is very important for the cost level and of course also for the service level in our customer care if we migrate  customers per year the summary from me are three points the first we look back at another successful year that our continued focus on bundling network investment and touch point excellence has meant that we’re able to increase our market share bring innovations to other market and delight our customer the second our challenges for the coming year will be to continue that growth path by focusing on our team growth on value management on cash and tariff innovations increasing share of wallet and of course also on cost excellence and the third point we feel well prepared for that journey of satisfying customers on a good basis for continued success they tend to be more loyal have lower churn rates and in switzerland they still tend to spend that little bit more than maybe in other countries and really last but not least our personnel maybe message i especially want to thank to my team for dedicated commitment and performance i am really proud to lead such a department which they convince and inspire our customers in such unique way and that makes me very confident that also the growth can continue in  thank you very much questionandanswer session bart morselt thank you marc very good okay its  oclock we are little bit ahead of schedule so my spontaneous decision is that we now take three questions which you dont have to ask after the meeting and thats a good idea because we have nice drinks after the meeting we will be using a microphone why three questions because its more than two and less than four this is the only reason for three questions please wait for the microphone who has the question fred let’s try to focus on the first part of the presentation by the way frederic boulan hi so its frederic boulan from bank of america quick question on the all ip migration you just mentioned can you talk a little bit about the implication that we will have for your business in the long run in terms of availability to save customers also cost efficiency capex efficiency so detailed plan here thank you marc werner you mentioned cost efficiency first section i didn’t understand it very well cost efficiency  frederic boulan it bites on your cost structure on your investment so are you currently spending money to do this all ip migration and what type of amount are we talking about where can you see investments in the long run once this all ip migration is completed marc werner as i mentioned before the plan is in the residential business of course and then we have the sme business and the enterprise business in residential business the plan is to migrate all the customers until  and of course then we see two points one point is customer satisfaction because all ip migration is still a little bit lower customer satisfaction because the migration is still not something that customer really wants to make i think it is something he has to make and thats one point and i guess an increase after the migration we can increase the customer satisfaction and second as i mentioned that we have now  less customer interaction activation means its still higher than it was before it means until we have migrated all the customer we will have more opex also in our customer care and of course then the attention is after  that we can decrease these costs but thats from the opex level and i dont its not my thought i guess to make any sentence on the capex level urs schaeppi urs will add something to that if we compare to costs of a migration in all to the  all ip world we have today approximately  francs additional per customer but we are on a learning track and this cost will go down and then if we have once migrated that the costs are much lower because its much easier to switch off new services if you are once into all ip world so today we have high costs but we will bring them down operator very good okay second question will fall to you vikram ubs vikram karnany yes thanks vikram from ubs i have a question on infinity now infinity as you were flagging earlier is reaching pretty much close to what your target level is around  so and clearly we have crossed our two anniversary as well so are you looking at in mobile per say a new proposition to drive growth something like same only proposition entering that particular market or do we expect to say some tweaking of infinity say infinity  is probably the next kind of move in terms of mobile to drive growth urs schaeppi actually two questions the first is yes we will increase the value of infinity thats our strategy to give our customers more value not only by pricing or roaming but also with features they are looking for thats one part of the question the second is sim only that’s a good question up to now the swiss market is still very subsidized oriented and we dont see actually really a big market in sim only but if we see that the market would change we would certainly very fast react but today its niche market and even competitors who are offering sim only product at the end they subsidize the handset in the second way martin voegeli we do  we have sim only offer in the end budget line urs schaeppi the product i mentioned before the one i mentioned on the embedded level this product is a sim only product but its not under swisscom brand its on the embedded brand on the entry level but thats the sim only product our first one operator sure the final question for this round jakob first row yes jakob bluestone thank you just a question on the tv product can you maybe just remind us on the content differentiation are there any particular differences in terms of the content that you have on your tv platform versus your competitors do you find any particular content that you need for or something else marc werner yes there is differentiation we have all the indiscernible its okay and thats exclusive on our tv platform martin voegeli yes but we’re referring to the difference between the first tv and tv  jakob bluestone actually is there any content that your competitors have which puts you at a disadvantage because you dont have it urs schaeppi not to the best to my knowledge that we have football range martin voegeli we have good content proposition jakob bluestone okay thanks urs schaeppi like tv  product adds on top of that you have a cloud based product instead of hard disk recorded base product and that differentiates us from current competitive positioning martin voegeli okay i think we can start i hope you had a nice break we also care for our customer for not only customer satisfaction but analyst satisfaction you will tell us at the end of the meeting so corporate customers are very important for swisscom group not only due to the revenue we do with them between the small and medium sized business from my colleague here in the room and myself we achieve to generate more than  billion revenue last year with business customers its not only that its also important because corporate customers are very demanding customers and they force us to be innovative and to go beyond our own limits but also due to the consumerization of the it we see more and more that corporate customers and mass market customers are converging and honestly i make a bet with you i am not sure if you meet us in five years time i am not sure that marc and myself will still be there as head of customer office in unit because we see more and more the trend towards  what we say ecosystem from bb bc and what we do for example right now on the ehealth market where we bind together doctors patients hospitals pharmacists we really believe that their future belongs to ecosystem that will be we go beyond the bias of bb or bc so its a very important market because it forces to be really innovative and looking in the future so the question for us in the board of directors last year was to see how can we improve our presence and be even more relevant in this big market and what we have decided in  was to merge our telco and it activities on the corporate side in  already swisscom decided to move from the traditional old mobile and fixed line organization of business lines into a customer facing unit organization it was one of the first telco worldwide to do that and i was at that time in charge of the new residential unit so maybe i am the managing guy because now i have to do it for the corporate customers so we can say swisscom is always at the edge of the convergence and we do the similar step last year by managing also i think as well as of the first telco worldwide the telco business with the very specific it business so we now an ict provider and the biggest one in switzerland by merging these two units that during ten years live separately we brought together  stuff and is probably one of the biggest merge last year in switzerland as you can imagine we did important post merger integration and the challenge for us was to do it without impacting negatively the business and the customer satisfaction and i am happy that we have achieved this performance now its the first time that i appear here in this room with the corporate segment and we believe that you need some information to better understand and qualify this new business which is quite complicated with very broad so i’ll not so much insist on performance figures as marc did on the mass market i believe its more an educational session to tell you what is this market and what are we intending to do there the rationale for the merger are clear we want to be better for our customer we want to be better for employees and we want to achieve better performance for swisscom and for our shareholders what we have served in many years is a change of the way companies are dealing with it and telecommunication needs the former organization with separate responsibilities between it responsible and telecom responsible using big corporate companies does not take place anymore they merge the activities together and they intend to have one single supplier able to answer the full spectrum of their need from telco to it they are strongly impacted by the pressure on cost but also on the rising digitalization of their companies cio needs to be much closer to the business and to do that they must have less qs and commodity it and for that they need to have strong partner that do that for them i met some weeks ago one of our customers  this small companies are very often under served by our competitors but we also work for very big companies so we have the full range of customer we have specialist of several industries and for certain types of it product you need to be strongly specialized we have the capability to serve our customers not only in switzerland but we have also to follow the customer strategy meaning that we dont intent to go after foreign customers but we have the goal to be able to serve our swiss corporate customers when they go abroad and for that we have a strong networks of partners enabling us to serve our customer worldwide and last but not least we can serve our customer where they are today not all customer are ready today to deliver the it out of the cloud some of them want to be still on premise and we can achieve that we can deliver not only infrastructure services enabling services but also on the application there up to the business process outsourcing so in terms of business and scope we are really unique now if you look at the organization we have as i mentioned we have one customer on the sale side with a unique account management team representing all product of swisscom enterprise so same we have back office with one unique customer service and in the middle of that we have created what we call solution centers you can almost consider them as pl because they have revenue and direct customer responsibilities in these solution centers you find the full responsibility to deliver the customer project from consulting specialized sales solution architect project management up to application management and exploitation we have organized the six solution centers on the topic where we want to be market leader as you can see here we have two solution center that are more telco oriented the wireline and the wireless business we have the new infrastructure cloud and data center and we have two strong services that we want to deliver workspace and collaboration for the stuff of our customers and more and more digitalization of business processes we have one specificity which is a vertical banking area because we serve more than  banks in switzerland and we have also besides the six solution center a so called business development unit in charge of the european new business so growth of tomorrow for example beside banks we are now acting concretely in two further verticals that are the utility market and the healthcare market as i mentioned we have a broad range of customer what is for me interesting last year is to notice that we have more and more customer taking everything from us if i just take one example the contract we made with deloitte deloitte asked us to make a full ict outsourcing which is network mobility virtual computing and sap and we have several customers that are more and more getting to full range of portfolio for sure we have competitions its a tough market customer are demanding customer have bargaining power and we have a strong price competition coming first from the bargaining power from the customer expecting every time lower prices but also coming from competition which is not only national but also international we fight against big it companies worldwide cloud based companies more and more and we fight against small local system integrators that have very close relationship to customers so we have the local small global big and our position is unique because we are local big so there is nobody bigger than us with swiss roots and this give us the good mix between capacity to act capacity to deliver and at the same time proximity the result of that is a net score of  which is high in the corporate market and as i told you we believe that the corporate segment can be a growth story we can grow by developing new product as we do today with the swisscom cloud that is interaction this year we can grow by winning new customers customers that are not working today or that we are winning back from competitors and we can grow by creating new markets as i mentioned for example on the health or energy sector as i told you we are not bring you with these figures this year but nevertheless i couldn’t resist to show you the development of the order entry because for me it was a little bit of question mark early last year are we  will we be able to increase our revenue discussed in the year where we merged two activities and in every kind of pmi risk that people will be more concentrate on the internal reorganization so i am happy to be able today to show you that despite this merger we have the highest order entry we have never achieved if you make the addition of the former telecommunication business and the former it business which shows a potential we have in this segment now i would like to spend some time on these slides because i need to let you understand how various segment is compared to the two other segment in the mass market we are not using swisscom price as telecommunication business alone we are not an it business alone we are providing our services under various forms the telecommunication business you know is very well its a front loaded business with big capex platform thats scaled and its a good business if you have a lot of volume on your platform and the cost was a fixed cost on the it business its another business its not so much front loaded with capex we dont need a lot of foreign invest we have more direct cost and the margins are thin and need a high management attention to be delivered swisscom it services our it company has developed in the last ten years a very good way of monitoring these slow margin business and i would do a mistake if i would try to manage all these values businesses with the single view and single source therefore we need to keep specificity of these businesses and therefore we should pay attention not to be willing to achieve too much cost synergies because it could be valued as threat at the end of the day in this department we develop product we are product manager and this product will be sold to many customers but we have also project business which are very individual where we have to pay attention to the chargeability of the people working on the various projects and you cannot make the business the same way between the product oriented business and the solution business indiscernible projects we are making system integration where we are really onsite we are delivering managing services out of the cloud so as you can see in this talk we manage several businesses we set our drivers several dynamics and i would not like to have your job and to be obliged to compute all these complexity to try to preempt the result of next year but we can talk after the break on how to do that as you probably heard we have end of last year made the biggest acquisition as a group in the french speaking part by acquiring the veltigroup veltigroup is one of the most successful ict company in the french speaking part of switzerland but is also doing  of its revenue on the swiss german market why did we make this acquisition first of all the gnp of the ornery is  off the swiss gnp this means that there is an important market there growing quicker than in the german part of the switzerland veltigroup in the last four five years grew by two digit every year it was a good business to do there to serve this business i had until the acquisition of veltigroup only  of my stuff it was not enough and we were not able to deliver on the project the customer wanted to do so as a first rationale is to better serve these parts of switzerland but the second rationale is the following veltigroup is a very agile company delivering system integration closer to the customer on an individual way and swisscom is more keen to make product that adds caliber so when we have to deliver individual services we hadn’t knew too much complexity thanks to veltigroup we can do much better also individual needs that we find mainly on the mid market segment these   seats company where the it department is not ready to take fully standardized product and still need to have a certain degree of individualization moving to the time we need to work together with veltigroup to make out the best integration of these two activities but the goal will be to keep the ability to deliver from one side fully managed standard product out of the cloud that scales and from the other side to serve individual needs of our customers if we achieve it will be absolute unique usb on the market and my last words are back to what our chief strategy officer said at the beginning to potential of digitalization we are lucky we are lucky to work in an industry where after the first technology of digitalization with smart phone a second way of coming what we call now the epl digitalization the unique combination of technology description like big data artificial intelligence virtual it ipad mobility and internet of things we lead to a new industrial revolution one speaks to there from industry  this new industrial revolution will change completely most of the industry especially in switzerland the place to work the business processes the go to market of companies will be completely reconsidered with this change and for us this means a big business opportunity how are we going to tackle these we will open in few weeks a new business campus in zurich we will organize with board of directors from our corporate customers’ workshop where we will discuss together about the digital strategy according to surveys  of the swiss company today have no real digital strategy by engaging to these discussions we will come to very interesting project with new digital technologies like big data like software defined networks we will deliver both on demand and we will accelerate the business of our customers because in the digital time its normal the big companies that are eating the small but the quick companies the its are the slower one last but not least swisscom is acting in the corporate market and for sure also on the mass market we have millions of private customers and we have been impacted ourselves by the digitalization over the last ten years we want to use this know how to help our corporate customers to reinvent their own interaction with the end users therefore we believe that the digital revolution will also lead to new forms of interaction between our corporate customer and their end users as you can see on the slide three examples of new business emerging from digitalization we are now going to invest in a so called low power wide area network a new network that will be able to connect with the low energy expectation or the connectors that will pop up everywhere in switzerland we are concretely now testing in the return industry and in the tourism industry location based platform that help for example in the tourist in those key areas help the tourist and the city to have other types of interaction with people who wanted to come for skiing and we have launched last year a crowd funding platform for the banking industry to help balance to better serve new forms on lending and funding so for me its a big excitement to be there are this point of time where obviously the swiss economy will be fully impacted by the digitalization because the survival growth opportunity that we still have to invent and to structure over the next few years thank you very much unidentified company representative good afternoon everybody also from my side  i will start with the quick description of  result if i had to choose one word to represent  result i would definitely choose growth and the growth comes if we look financials because point one we will go in details in a second represent the good growth in revenues ebitda and free cash flow but also growth is the right word for operations because we have been leader for third year in a row in the residential broadband world and we have been also leader in the corporate segment and these happens since a lot of the years also if i look at the network rollout and the overall ultra broadband world we are definitely the fiber company in italy with the market share that is almost  and also if i look the future i think we are on the sunny part of the street because our plan to further expand our network and also our plan to leverage continuously on innovation not only on broadband infrastructure but also for instance on data center infrastructure or wifi infrastructure i think is strengthening also our possibility to succeed in the future lets go into details these slide shows basically financials i think that from whoever side you look at the slide i think you will find the positive news because if i look at revenues we are posting  growth if we strip out the hub in revenue so the low marginality revenues that actually growth will be even higher almost  if i move down the pl also the ebitda shows and confirm an important growth  also capex are lets say confirming a high level of investment also in  basically we invested more than  of our revenues clearly  and  represent for us extraordinary years because we are deploying a huge fiber rollout network we will go in details in a second but also if i look at free cash flow ordinary free cash flow so not consider these extraordinary rollouts of the network i would say that having also  almost  million of generation of free cash flow is a good result i would say that in a nutshell those results are very strong very solid in an absolute terms but also if you put such results in the overall italian contest that we are all our competitors are posting actually different results and not growing but actually decreasing i think that also its strengthening the result and the performance of our company if we move to outside operations we start then with residential business and instead of talking just of one year the good thing is that we can talk about the last three years because the story is always the same if you sum up the growth of fastweb in the last three years basically you can see that we eat almost  new customers but if i look at basically all other competitors shows that they basically the older market reach  so it means that all the other competitors were negative so if i sum up telecom italia vodafone and wind basically they were decreasing their market share which is pretty much self explanatory because if we look at the market share basically we have been growing our position by  where telecom italia has decreased and all other competitor where almost flat but that was basically just the family business if we go to the enterprise also here the situation is quite solid i can divide the enterprise word in two types of services the voice and letter and where you can see a solid history growth because in  we have been able to overcome the  threshold market share we are almost at  and also the good thing is that also in the value of this added services we are growing in a good manner in  basically the market share remains flat not because our revenues were flat but actually because also the market has grown and thats very good news having said so also here if we want to draw some conclusions we look at our much fastweb market share has grown it the last year basically here we are talking about  growth we are basically all other competitor have decreased their market share if we move today with our broadband which is quite a fashionable lets say topic to discuss these days here i think we have even better teacher because if i put together the fiber to the home market and the fiber to the street one basically you can pretty much see that we have  market share specifically in the fiber to home market not withstanding or nevertheless that competitors have started fiber offering since four years ago i think at the end of the day all competitors take up in the last four years has been  customers which is not something that makes us awake at night overall with our broadband world i think is lead by fastweb in a very lets say important way but that was the present we need also to look at the future and if i look our plan of further investing and further expanding our network i think as i was saying before we are in the sunny part of the street because in  we finished our first expansion basically at the end of  we were reaching  of population italian population with our broadband network we relaunched the investment and the actually our aim is to cover  as urs was mentioning earlier by  this is an ambitious plan but i think that these natural continuation of our rollout the first rollout was performed to eating all our expectations with no delay in time with no delay in performance and therefore i think its the right moment to push and accelerate or further expand our ultra broadband network it is an ambitious project because we will be the largest  it will be the largest wireline ngn built up by an operator in all europe the good thing is that we have chosen a very solid technology because fiber to the street technology is not only a very good technology today on average on our clients we are experiencing today  megabit as a performance italy as a unique in particular cabinet architecture they are very very close to the final user on average  meters and this allows the possibility to exploit significant higher performance if compared  even if compared with other european country we have recently done some field test with real customers so not loud test and we try to test all the possible evolutions starting with the vectoring with vdsl and also coming to the gfast the good news is that if want to consider the highest performance on average we can reach with g fast over  megabit as a performance but the good news is that whatever technology you use the  of lines and so of family can go above  megabits this is a very good result its not just fastweb that is saying so couple of days ago also british telecom announced similar i would say results with their performances so the good thing also if we look at the future we need to smile because we are investing in the right technology and actually we have quite a time advantages versus all our competitor but as i said infrastructure is just the first layer we are not serving just families we are serving also business therefore we invested a lot also in value added services managed services cloud services and we also build a tier four data center that we just finished its the number  its the first in italy and only in italy so also here we have very good time advantage is the fifth in europe and the fourth i think is the one that swisscom has created and this is the th in the world so here you can show that fastweb is getting market share because for using and delivering superior quality if compared with the others all of our other competitors are focusing on price we dont compete with price we compete with infrastructure and quality coming back to the residential we are testing and actually launching two cities a very interesting services at least we believe it will be a very  it will have a very good appeal in the customers so basically we want to extend the customer experience that normally a customer lives in his home also outside so basically we want to lets say integrate our broadband network with a wifi network and we will use modem like g go in all for instance basically we will leverage on customer modems on old spot and the good thing is that we selected two mid tier cities the penetration after just one month was  g go waited at least six months to get to the same lets say penetration rate and also the daily usage is very very good because we are talking about on average  megabit so i would say in a nutshell the performance of  of fastweb has been extremely good is near of growth and basically also if i look at the future we have all the good ingredients to repeat the very solid performance of  thank you very much mario rossi good afternoon also from my side finally some numbers some facts and figures i start with revenue just some highlights so we are able to grow revenue in switzerland by chf  million that’s mainly driven by high margin service revenues  million increase of service revenues in switzerland and here i would like to point out the very strong performance of residential service revenue grew by  or over chf  million and also the market performance was very strong we added over  revenue generating units market added  postpaid mobile customers we increased tv subscribers by over  and the growth of  tv subscribers sme delivered stable revenues that’s a good performance because we enjoy very very high market shares in this segment and the most important thing in the corporate segment is you remember back in  we had declining revenues in the connectivity business especially in the mobile corporate segment was able to stop these losses both in fixed mobile and the revenue losses only in the single digit area we had already good performance from alberto  growth in revenues in italy on ebitda ebitda results exceptional increased by  million before we saw that the service revenue in switzerland increased by over  million you would now expect that ebitda at swisscom switzerland level would increase maybe by  million  million thats not the case we will tap in between we had higher subscription as socks and slc acquisition and retention costs  million more than back in  there are two reasons one reason is we had more retentions about  more retentions compared to prior year and the second reason is we had more market dynamics the kpi per subscriber was higher and the impact was about  million really we had more competition usually we are not the first to move as the leader into market but switzerland is handset driven market so we had to follow increase our subsidies in order to maintain our market shares thats also the reason why we see a slightly small ebitda at sme and corporate i would say was able to more or less to deliver stable ebitda fastweb ebitda of  million euro once again i think thats a strong performance in that difficult environment now in italy the breach from ebitda down to net income ebitda was  million higher than prior year on depreciation we have  million more thats clearly the reason because we had more and higher capex during the last few years thats just accounting impact of that on other financial results we have a negative impact from a value adjustment of interest rate swap we did some years ago last year we had the positive impact of around  million this year we have a negative impact of the value adjustment non cash value adjustment of about  million income taxes are  million higher than last year last year we had some corporate restructuring in q but the tax rate is still quite low is  long term tax rate is still around  but clearly thats i think is an advantage still an advantage of investing in the swiss company enjoying these low tax rates a few words on capex capex in switzerland increased in  by about  million and if we look at the different capex categories we invested in fiber to the home fiber to the street fiber to the building so this whole fiber story around chf  millions thats  million more than  we are able to keep capex more or less stable compared to  there are two reasons we had lower capex in the wireless area we invested about  million  million less than in the prior year and in project it product development we invested  million  million less than  about to explain the last rollout on ftts was completed in  the next one will be at less expensive so we saw the capex peak in fastweb in  on operating free cash flow after the cash flow proxy i think you have one element in  we had a decrease of networking capital in  we had an increase of networking capital thats just by accident over the year end there are no structural changes i am not worried about these evolution no structural changes talking about cash flow after the operating free cash flow we paid net interest and the taxes together approximately  million it makes a net cash flow of  taxes of  billion out of that we distribute   to swiss francs dividend per share that means  billion we had to increase our net debt by  million mainly because of the acquisition of publigroupe the purchase price was chf  million then you can deduct some acquired cash and outstanding minorities chf  million and we already started with the sale of securities and major participations which gave about  million cash inflow key ratio net debt over ebitda remains unchanged at x then in  just a few notes on the refinancing we did three refinancing transactions i would say very successful one in euro two in swiss francs the last one we were able to get  years at  just as an opportunistic refinancing and we will do so also this year using this low interest environment just to mention in addition to that we have credit lines with  unused credit lines with  banks with backs facility of chf  billion the situation of our net debt which stands at  billion by the end of this year you see about  or over  of finance by bonds  billion of finance in euro which helps to hedge the euro investment in fastweb and quite happy to the maturity profile we have one peak in  where we have a due date of a swiss franc bond of  billion with a coupon of  but overall we are happy to financing average cost of interest is slightly over  also here i think that’s clear advantage of swisscom and switzerland compared to other european peers some words on the pension plan situation i think thats a  the other side of the favorable inter situation for a corporate what matters in terms of cash and financing is the swiss pension law and not ifrs these two worlds are totally different under the swiss regime we have a coverage ratio of  which is the surplus of  billion so the pension fund is around  billion in our pension fund but due to other assumptions on the discount rate and the mortality the ifrs picture is totally completely different in our accounts on the ifrs we have to show with deficit of  billion of this the gap between swiss accounting principles under the pension fund and ifrs is  billion  can be explained by this interest rates decrease last year you see in switzerland we calculate this  down on the left hand side on the ifrs we have to use a discount factor of  it’s really important to know is that cash contributions are not based on ifrs valuation method and the contributions in  are likely to decrease by about  million compared to  will be around chf  million chf  million the reason is we will have a lower number of early retirements but on the pl again it looks different we will have around  million higher pension expense not cash pension expense booked on the personnel expense which will explain the main part of our low ebitda guidance on a comparable currency basis with that i would like to discuss the outlook slide with you so we dont know where the swiss franc will go in  we decided to build up our guidance on parity hoping that it will not stay at one chf for the swiss economy the left hand side you see the results of  the forex impact mainly technical impact consolidating the euro at chf  the revenue and ebitda from fastweb on a comparable basis derive a net revenue at  billion ebitda at  billion and capex at  billion in  on net revenue we expect in switzerland an increase of chf  billion at fastweb in local currency more or less stable that brings us to an ebitda at revenue guidance of for  billion for  on ebitda we expect in switzerland around  million less ebitda there are three reasons first reason it is noncash pension cost increase of  million second reason you remember we had quite high gains from sale of real estate in  this will be  million low in  and then migrations to all ip will have slightly higher cost for this all ip migration but overall we can say swiss business on an operational basis more or less stable  compared to  at fastweb level we have a slightly higher ebitda clearly benefiting also from the results of the ftts strategy which really works we can migrate customers we have lower fees to telecom italia and we have lower chance on capex in switzerland capex level will remain unchanged fastweb as i mentioned it before reached to the peak in  will drive slightly lower capex despite the last ftts or the new ftts rollout its important on free cash flow level on the free cash flow proxy there is no material impact on the foreign exchange impact of course its difficult to predict how this situation after mid of january for switzerland what will happen with our economy if something dramatic will happen then of course it might have on the long term mid long term also an impact on our business coming to dividends no surprise on that since  we stand chf  we think the chf  it will remain like that we will propose to the agm next year no surprise to  and if we reach the targets  we will again propose to the agm  to pay out of chf  per share i think its still the good dividend yield over  in this environment a few words on the impact of the currency changes i think it is cost that impact on the pl and cash flow on balance sheet the impact is very limited equity ratio is not impacted by these changes on the swiss franc situation i mentioned that the free cash flow proxy remains more or less stable now talking about the hedging strategy we usually hedge cash flows per yield we need to buy the couple of  euros and a couple of  us dollars both positions are in the euro case unfortunately hedged for  so we dont get this windfall profit but again the exposure towards these two currencies is very very limited finally as you can imagine what you heard from christian we need to do a restatement because we merged its onto corporate business so the main part of its which reported in the past in the segment offer will come to the segment and the former corporate part of it will go to the segment network because that was divided then we will have some other small adjustments regarding real estate company and marketing we will deliver the new segment structure and the new numbers before we publish end of  before we publish q it will be published i think mid of march the new numbers the restatement okay okay mid of april we will deliver to you the restated numbers that you can adjust your spreadsheets with that i’ll hand over to bart for the qa questionandanswer session bart morselt thank you mario alright we have a little qa time now and we are well in plan so who can i give the floor let’s start with nicolas here first row again sorry carola i saw you are late but you are second do we have microphones yes they are coming up q  nicolas cotecolisson thank you and nicolas cotecolisson hsbc i’d like to have your take on the first coming four month of telecommunication law i was wondering if you could have a impact on the wholesale prices for fiber and if you could create some opportunities for orange or sunrise to be more aggressive in fixed broadband a  mario rossi so it is the telecommunication law is in a discussion in the parliament and i dont think that we really will have an impact a major impact in the next two or three years on this level and then its always if such a law in discussion a lot of things are open but the revision what the regulatory is asking for are really smaller changes so i dont think that we will have major changes there q  nicolas cotecolisson so would you think that orange and sunrise have some abilities to disrupt your very high market challenge for fixed broadband a  mario rossi no q  nicolas cotecolisson another way to ask okay lets take it differently then investment scheme we had discussion during the coffee break with the utilities obviously that happens to your fiber and to the grant being build that potentially can be resorted to your competitors how do you see that changing in the coming quarters a  mario rossi yes thats a good question what could happen is that the utilities which are building up to fiber networks only in cities and in several cities they could do wholesaling and now the question is to which price and this could lead to a price pressure that’s clear but if you look to the swiss market overall that the market is still driven by the bundling business by the service collecting but it could give some price pressure but really we all take this consideration and account for  and i think its much too early to make speculations about the strategy of orange in switzerland i think its much too early bart morselt alright next question goes to carola q unidentified analyst thank you and maybe a couple of followups back on the utilities i was wondering what is the population coverage that they are able to offer a commercial service alternative to yours in currently and what is the plan and another scenario that could be discussed if we were to consider potential sunrise or orange merger as back in  what would you see as potential remedies to allow this merger to go ahead and back to italy instead i was wondering if fastweb is currently happy with no agreement with hutchinson on whats the performance on g dont you feel the need to be more competitive maybe with the team and both funded have probably better service on for g and then maybe a brief comment on the proposal by agcom on the wholesale prices in italy there are couple of scenarios presented which would be the best and what you think vodafones reaction would be thank you finished bart morselt carola we are seven men here we cannot cope with ten questions at the time so let start from here first one perhaps on the utility coverage a mario rossi utility coverage fiber is about  but they are only in the cities actually this gives the population coverage of  then the second question merge sunrise and orange its difficult to say it would from an industrial side it would make sense from the industrial side there would be synergy on the network side on the other side but thats only speculation i think the regulatory would look in another way to such a merge today than several years ago and remedies i dont know but there would certainly be some remedies a  martin voegeli and we would certainly have new distributions of the licenses of spectrum because then they would have too much spectrum bart morselt you want to take on a  unidentified company representative okay on lets say the mobile and i think that we should see our revolution as a modular step first we would become full indiscernible even if we have been always we have invested a lot in the mobile but our first step will be to become indiscernible so to have full control end to end also of the sim and then definitely it will be important for the future to select one or more partners that can deliver the same quality that we are delivering on the fixed cost on the mobile but bear in mind that in the future i dont think that would be any more in mobile and network and a fixed line network because also the wifi will take an important role and thats why we are going in these direction also with the wifi coverage because what we want to achieve is to repeat the same experience indoor also outdoor and also the wifi can be much more effective than any mobile network so i think that first of all in the future we will have all the right tools in order to offer a very good experience regardless if you are indoor or outdoor coming back to agcom agcom is now put as consultation two scenarios normally i find strange to have two scenarios but italy is always full of creativity having said so for us i think its critical this subloop not only for us actually because also other play decided to deeply invest in the ftts technology and i think that all the results are showing that that ftts and so that subloop is key and therefore we do expect that in the future coherently also to increasing competition and order decision that also these agcom for  we do expect a decrease in the subloop for us the most important decision that needs to be taken is on the subloop bart morselt alright next question here georgios second row q georgios ierodiaconou thank you perhaps a couple of questions on switzerland and you discussed about the cost of all ip rollout i remember in the past you also considered the significant small cell deployment which hasn’t really picked up momentum what kind of cost should we expect from all these type of project having mind to improve quality and to be prepared for the future and if you could also maybe give us an indication of what are the savings that you will get from all ip migration at the end of the process not just avoiding these cost but savings beyond that and maybe a question for indiscernible on metro where all the noise is going there obviously on a halter there what kind of outcome do you expect and will that change your plans on the fiber to cabinet rollout if its accelerated thank you a  unidentified company representative good maybe on all ip so the big investment in the it systems are done so the investment what we have now are more opex because we have to migrate the customer and thats one point we get savings on several areas even when we are  the first one we can switch off the tdm network the second savings which we get is we are much more agile in product developments so we get shorter time to market and the short benefits are the cost cost for migration for example if you are moving your location today you have a physical intervention if you are in the all ip world you just push the button and then the migration is done so in the future we will have lower cost to serve lower cost to deliver but that’s the main rationale behind this all ip topic but we will have certainly some years where we have to go through this migration and the challenge will be certainly the bb segments because there you have solutions you have pbax business in it so we will have some work to do in the next year a  unidentified company representative and related to metro web yes its true there is metro looks like a very fashionable topic these days in italy i would say that i hear a lot of words but i never see an industrial plan and as fastweb we are much more interested in substance and industrial plan rather than the new ones i would say that for us and we know metro very well because we created the company and we are still owner of  stake is a local player at the end of the day i mean we are interested in the national coverage and the european agenda sets important target by  we have technology when it was possible in the right cities we have deployed fiber to home technology fastweb cover the seven main cities in italy with fiber to the home but the technology of all and now we have fiber to the street technology which has been proven to be future proof very solid and most importantly much more sustainable much more quick and therefore i mean the market is free we selected such technology telecom italia selected such technology vodafone has selected such technology if metro wants to deploy with its own money not public money with its own money some fiber to the home in some second tier cities they can do it but for us we have never been against the infrastructure competition we have been always competing the market by our infrastructure definitely we think that the time advantage versus all our competitors in the future will increase rather than weakening bart morselt very good our next question indiscernible in the back q  unidentified analyst yes thank you just building on st georges this question there on ip spending capex if you look at your capex breakdown that you gave in one of your slides slide  shows that the it systems all ip and other capex spend was materially low in  is that because of the fact that you have done all you need to do for your ip spend on the capex side and now you are moving to opex is that the explanation for that drop and secondly if we look at the profile of your spending it was a lot more fiber network driven in  is that what we should expect you to be spending a lot more on going forward ie is the split for  a picture for the future as well as to how you are going to spend your money in switzerland thank you a  unidentified company representative so the drop  compared to  is exactly what you mentioned its break through is the capex for all ip going forward i would expect more or less the same profile like in  but within fiber midterm we will see a change from ftth to ftts because ftth will be completed by end of  but the overall amount will remain in  for fiber around the same bart morselt alright next question from jakob q  jakob bluestone hi i have got three set of followon questions firstly on regulation i think there was also some parliamentary discussion going on roaming so maybe if you can provide a similar update to where that debate is and what your expectations are on roaming rates in switzerland and secondly again also sticking with capex your mobile capex as you mentioned is down to   in  versus  given you have got very strong growth in mobile data traffic how sustainable do you think it is that mobile capex is coming down do you see i think you said in your annual report that your mobile data traffic is doubling annually do you expect the mobile capex will have to start to rise again or what you think you can continue to see further capex declines and then finally just one point of clarification on the tax i think the tax guidance you gave was pl tax if i understood correctly is the same true for cash tax because your cash tax is going up about  million every year for the last couple of years a  unidentified company representative good maybe on the first question of regulation and roaming in the parliament there is an ask for roaming enterprise regulation in switzerland but there will be big debates on it i think the regulator sees it in another way and we will make price moves on the roaming in the next weeks so i think we will not have fast roaming regulation and the technology will change it to much faster than the regulation will be implemented so i think there is  that’s not the really risk and then on the capex and tax mario a  mario rossi so we spent cash tax around  million and its same all assets thats a good amount its always difficult from yeartoyear it depends on the different assessment from the authorities about  around   is a good number and on capex yes in  we had higher mobile capex because then we started this whole renovation of the whole radio network we went in each and every antenna and then we had  and started rollout we had slightly lower capex in  and this high data traffic that brings some additional capex in terms of software but thats a low double digit number so overall if you add  million  million to the current mobile capex you are in a good range but dont expect lower capex bart morselt upfront here usman q  usman ghazi hi thanks for taking the question usman from berenberg i just wanted to just discuss i mean the swiss domestic outlook revenues is up  million again this year in almost no operational leverage implied by the guidance now you said that last year or in  that was because mainly because of higher sack as the other competitors trying react to gain a bit of market share forcing you to give away more to just keep your market share would it not be more sensible strategy to let the other guys have a bit of market share so that you end up  because at the moment you are getting the revenue growth but you are not getting any incremental profitability because you are having to spend more just to keep that market share any views on that would be great the other question i had was just on the wifi strategy in switzerland i mean we discussed in italy but in switzerland haven’t heard much on that point so i would be interested on that and finally again on mobile if i look at the mobile churn rates they picked up in the second half they were only  if i look at the data file they have gone up to  over the second half as a percentage point in two quarters which is a bit high i am just wondering what drove that thank you a  unidentified company representative okay we will take first two questions and then mario will take the churn one on the development in switzerland and then the market share and that was your question how strong do we want to defend our market shares so we are in a fixed cost business and in a fixed cost business we will fight for this market share so we will do it in a clever way to differentiation but we certainly fight for market share and wifi strategy what we do is actually we have safety wifi network we do this we have public wireless  public wifi networks also for a bit uploading our networks into cities and indoor what we are going is for wifi calling because if you have the new buildings which are very good isolated its hard to get indoor coverage and thats why we go for wifi calling but thats approximately our strategy and we are quite robust against this safety wifi because with infinity you get you can eat tariff so we dont care to much about this other wifi networks which are coming off its more an offload technology for us a  mario rossi and slightly higher turn rate on mobile is because on higher churn on prepaid we dont disclose the postpaid churn for competitive reasons but i can assure you that postpaid churn rate is one of the lowest in europe and it was stable during the whole year bart morselt alright next question from indiscernible q  unidentified analyst hi indiscernible from numara just a quick question about the infinity tier going back you said that you started structuring your added value and features to that could you give an idea of what kind of upselling within the tiers that you saw during the year please a  unidentified company representative we will do good things on this topic there are lots of people who are hearing to this conference no i think we dont really disclose what we are doing but we will do good things within infinity to increase the value of this product keep the churn low keep good net additions q  unidentified analyst thank you bart morselt fred q  unidentified analyst hi thanks couple of questions first thing on the capex side you shared the vision a couple of years ago about the capex cycle and we were in a peak capex movement for couple of years but then overtime you were painting a picture with declining capex once you reach a milestone on fiber in particular so can you update that view and more of a followup here seeing rest of your target was  covered by  in indiscernible speed i think  so here i notice now down to  so i’m not sure if there is different technological choice embedded and then third question if you could just clarify your roaming exposure with bit more details in terms of roaming in roaming out and what kind of scenario we could sensitivity on this year in terms of prices but also just volumes this was in fx movements what is the sensitivity in the business if you see changes in tourism or any other factors thank you a  unidentified company representative maybe i will take the first part of the question concerning the technology mix of this broadband network and then mario can answer to the more financial topics our footprint of  ultra broadband in  is a mix of  its the technology mix one fiber to the home with more than  billion of the customers will have fiber to the home and the rest is actually fiber to the street with also gfast so we will go gfast in  and this will bring us speeds on fiber to the street gfast which are much above  megabit but that’s the mix of our technology to go faster on coverage we will push fiber to the street and gfast maybe on the figures mario a  mario rossi i think you refereed to our midterm guidance some years ago i think that time we really thought that after the ftth rollout this fiber story complex story is over what we see is we are still very high competition from the cable operator we have cable coverage in switzerland one of the highest over  and if you want to remain in the fixed line business as was explained we need to deploy indiscernible fiber investments we need to deliver higher speed and we really on the pressure also from the political side to deliver not ftth but ultra broadband also in rural areas thats the reason obviously that at least until end of  we will have this high capex level for fiber and then we carefully evaluate the situation but we still have this competition with the cable to be of higher churn to meet our broadband and tv targets and then we look again at the situation on roaming we have this in  we have the roaming revenues outbound of slightly below chf  million thats the decline of about  we dont disclose the margin and inbound roaming was below  million bart morselt alright in the back luis prota q luis prota yes thank you its luis prota from morgan stanley two questions please first is on the triple play offering and you were mentioning that the migration from non vivo to vivo is just driving  extra swiss franc arpu so the question is what are the dynamics there so i dont know whether there is a lot of free tv included there or there are many moving pieces so i would like to understand why so low the arpu accretion there and the second question is kind of rephrasing a question on infinity that was made by some of my colleagues here in terms of data monetization with the rest of the sector pushing clients to take higher bundles to monetize data in the case swisscom which is charged by speed and you cannot  flat fee for data i would like to understand your view on data monetization and how or whether you are seeing people just trading up for higher speeds because you are consuming more data this means that they need more speed or what are the dynamics there a  unidentified company representative maybe i will begin with monetization of data then marc can take the arpu topic for triple play i am not convinced that this data monetization where we have pack so lets say  giga  giga  giga will work long term because in a world where everybody is using his smartphone with the speed of mobile networks is increasing very fast the consumption of data will go out very fast and then i think its a very short time you can really monetize  make a monetization on data packs and then you are in a flat rate world thats a bit our view on this monetization of mobile data and therefore i think the logic of infinity is a good one and we will see how the market will develop a  marc werner in vivo portfolio the cases that we already had triple play before that means the new portfolio must create because of the new tv  offering that means just and its migration from existing triple play to new triple play and in this case i guess even once the arpu upside is not so bad because its not the new portfolio it was just the new tv product in the portfolio thats the case bart morselt trying to take somebody else q  michael bishop thanks its michael bishop from rbc just a quick question on pricing i guess historically you have always tended to create a slightly new product or bundle as a means of getting more out of the customers and as you move forward and you offering flat rates on bundles can you not think about more sort of nominal price increases each year which i guess might be more hidden from the consumer sort of letter and quite a few of the other markets like uk fixed line for instance is quite aggressive sort of  to  annual price increases and churn doesnt seem to have material increase so it would be good to get your views on that a  unidentified company representative in a market like switzerland its extremely difficult to make price increases you can only increase your output through delivering more value that means increasing the value in the bundle and yes thats a bit equation that’s a bit of our strategy thats why we are pushing bundles we try to bring in more value and to make an up selling but just to increase the price is not it doesn’t work bart morselt you wanted the second followup michael q  michael bishop i was just going to followup and say if you look at cablecom it seems to be their strategy particularly on the tv side and if you look at the results i don’t seem to have had any sort of increase in churn so could you not i mean i appreciate perhaps on the mobile side is more difficult but on the fixed one side does seem to be all that doing if you dont follow a  unidentified company representative yes cablecom is doing it in a clever way i say for swisscom it would be very hard to do such a thing we have to deliver additional value bart morselt alright second row q  unidentified analyst thank you one first question on regulation after roaming the situation where switzerland is also in a strange situation is the mobile termination what is  could we expect some change over there and second thing could you remind us this is a small question for mario the remaining book value of fastweb in your accounts thank you a mario rossi so mobile termination its not a regulated business in switzerland and we have quite not a too high asymmetric in the mobile termination so and there is always discussion where how much asymmetric will be there are different lets say interest how this would be but i think it will stay quite stable a  unidentified company representative it has around  asymmetry it has been very stable over the past few years while this  on the absolute level means there is a charge  per minute we are charging  i think its around  if you calculate well a mario rossi and book value of fastweb in balance sheet is  billion euro including a goodwill of  billion bart morselt alright next question q  unidentified analyst yes thanks so just going back in terms of the quality scores you are flagging clearly your absolute scores have been probably number one in the last  years but in the last survey we have seen the competitors also have improved their position in the market its important now that to understand clearly your premium quality driven by that network quality advantage that you were commanding is this really sustainable when the quality gap is converging can you maintain that same quality premium in the market and specially in the business segment now given that you have such a dominant share and in the small pockets like smes can the competitors really have an impact and will you be really focusing in terms of market share in the business segment thanks a mario rossi good that’s clear the quality advantage in the mobile network if our competitors are constantly investing big amounts in the network is becoming smaller thats clear but we will do all that we will have to network leadership coverage is an important topic broadband also in the rural areas its important in switzerland so i think we will be able to have an advantage on the network quality side but it becomes smaller but its not the only differentiator we have we invest in the customer service we invest in our product and then thats normally in a mature market that you have to differentiate new ones on several levels and i am convinced that we can keep the price premium bart morselt alright i suggest we do the final question and i see one hand indiscernible go ahead q  unidentified analyst thank you one question about your guidance of revenue it includes some new acquisitions of veltigroup and public group could you give us a rough idea of what is the impact looking forward on the full year thank you a mario rossi the main part is the acquisition of veltigroup revenue is slightly over chf  million that’s included a  unidentified company representative and there will be little bit additional public group a mario rossi little bit of public group but top of it will be already consolidated so its not material end of qa a  unidentified company representative alright before i close down you start cheering and applauding one or two remarks there is a little group of investors that is supposed to meet with heinz herren heinz herren sitting in the back head of networks for small group meeting which i suggest we’re starting around ten minutes its in the room sidney on the first floor here okay that is the first remark secondly we would like to invite you to have drinks and some bites finger food with us some of most of the people here will be around so you can do a little bit of informal chatting and thirdly for those who would like to be on the bus to the airport the shuttle goes at  pm sharp and if you need to go sooner its better to take a taxi but the  pm shuttle leaves in front of the building here at this point is it from our side i would like to thank you
