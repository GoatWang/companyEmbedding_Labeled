unicam® connectors for years the installation of cable networks field connectors was a fairly timeconsuming process to ensure the seamless flow of dataforming light each hairthin strand of glass fiber had to be glued into a connector technicians had to tote along portable ovens to heatcure the special epoxy after waiting for the connector to finish curing the technician would clean and polish the components by hand to ensure the pristine surface required for optical transmission on average it took six to eight minutes to terminate a single connector results varied widely based on the skill and

customer’s call it may not seem like it now but it wasn’t that long ago that fiber to the home ftth was in its infancy there were no mass deployments no customized products and no recommended or common installation procedures while corning had been preparing for ftth deployments for many years we hadn’t yet had the opportunity to work with a customer and realize the vision of taking optical fiber all the way to the end customer that changed when the first major carrier announced its plans to deploy ftth technology with this announcement we got to work handinhand with our customer our goal was to merge our expertise in fiber optics with the customer’s need for a reliable futureready product that could be deployed rapidly to allow for largescale ftth deployments the result the flexnap™ system which uses standard optical fiber cables with network access points preinstalled at customerspecified locations along the length of the cable with this product we were able to bring the lifeenhancing benefits of optical fiber to the customer with deployments several times faster than traditional field installations together with our customer we developed a product that

material may be challenged and removed april  learn how and when to remove this template message marketing communications falls into various categories relating to marketing to the public from advertising promotions sales branding and online promotion it is so spread out and iconic that it has become a favoured term amongst practitioners it is a symbolic tool that helps organizations interact with their many stakeholders in the market by promoting their goods or services to them whenever members of the public interact with an organization marketing communication has been used this is a significant process where businesses use to gain success and knowledge on their brand in order to gain success in marketing both the organization and members of the public must be involved businesses cannot operate if they target every market to satisfy their consumers satisfactions by targeting audiences who appreciate the organizations marketing program will gain a successful branding a target audience is a group of people that aimed at by the marketers delivering them a message of their brand the target audience will most likely be people who will react to their marketing communications in a positive way marketing communications can fall into the same meaning as advertising advertising is the most common marketing term that organizations and even members of the public understand and evaluate it has come across people at least a number of times in their everyday lives advertising is only a small section of marketing communications and is not an alternative term to it promotion and marketing communications is difficult to comprehend therefore considering it as a term that can be similar within each other is more simple the concept of the marketing communications mix which is a range of tools available to an organizations to deliver a clear and consistent message to their target audiences thus impacting the businesses performance negatively or positively it is also commonly called the promotional mix crosier  states that all terms have the same meaning in the context of the ps marketing communications is very similar to marketing in general similar to comparing advertising to marketing communications when asking what marketing is the marketing mix comes to mind and the most common way of describing it is by explaining the ps product price place and promotion price of a product or service can send a message to their target audience for example comparing a  bag to a  bag the more expensive bag will most likely be a luxury item more durable than the cheaper one this is market information that can easily send out a message to all target audiences the most fundamental part of explains what marketing is using the ps is that it elaborates how promotion is crucial and a significant aspect of what marketing is all about marketing communications and the marketing mix falls into the category of the marketing plan the marketing plan is a specific document that outlines current marketing situations this plan identifies key opportunities and threats set objectives and develops an action plan to achieve marketing goals each section of the ps sets its own object for instance pricing objective might be to increase sales in a certain geographical market by pricing their own product or service lower than their competitors this creates a significant change in the market because more people of the target market would aim to do business with your organization than your competitors because pricing is one of the most significant aspects of marketing that can change the whole market positively and or negatively marketing communications presents a marketing strategy to draw the attention of all target audiences sending a message about the organizations ps can excite their interests and can help create a successful business marketing communications consists of  key factors persuasion and information objectives contact points stakeholders and marketing communication activities firstly all marketing communications goal is to persuade their target audience to change their attitudes and behaviour towards the organization  there are many ways to persuade the target audience for instance marketers can provide a valid reasoning and significant facts that can change consumer behaviour significantly listening and responding to any questions to the organization can go a long way in the driving success of the organization  from making the target audience feel special and heard of can instantly change their emotions and opinion of the organization marketing communication can work without an objective generally creating brand awareness delivering information educating the market and an advanced positive image for the organization can also persuade the target audience contact points must require managing and coordinating a marketing message contact points can range from stores where customers are able to physically experience the product and see it for themselves customer calls where the hotline will be able to help all customers in need and advertisement through television social media and others successful marketing requires that a message at every contact point can persuade any target audience stakeholders are anyone in the target market that can influence the purchase of the product or that can create success to the company competitors can be important stakeholders for an organization by two competitors working together can help protect their market shares finally marketing communication activities can send out a message informally by explicitly marking communication programs or informally through the marketing mix there are two key types of messages marketing communications can deliver unplanned and planned messages planned messages are delivered through advertising sales promotion public relations direct marketing personal selling point of purchase packaging specialties sponsorships licensing and customer service unplanned messages however are all about the company or brand sending out simplicity messages to consumers both types of messages are crucial as they bring a unified story to the market marketing communicationedit communication is one important aspect of the marketing mix indeed marketing communication is often the largest component of communication within a company which may be to present company value objectives or specific products and services to investors customers or the general public in the st century communications objectives continue to lead towards more customized messages targeting customer groups or individuals to create high responses and greater brand interaction as business becomes increasingly global with greater access to internet mobile phones and social media new challenges exist with communication professionals to inform people in particular foreign markets to facilitate business activity shifts in the global economy and access to new markets lead also to greater demands for product shipping and services delivered to customers in foreign markets to be effective communication strategies must converge with marketing objectives while also account for local languages dialects and cultural norms communications are including both external communication and internal communication external communication can be market research questionnaires office website guarantees company annual report and the presentation for investors internal communication can be the marketing materials price list product catalogues sales presentations and management communications on the other hand each market demands different types of communications for example industrial market demands a more personal communication but consumer market demand a nonpersonal communication there are also  different fundamental types of communication onetomany this kind of communication is the most original communication it is generated from a single broadcast point and then available over airwaves or in mass print runs this type of communication is usually adapted to news distribution that does not specific not even interactive such as in an urgent notice play over airwave from broadcast in an industry it is helpful for the general announcement manytoone manytoone is usually connected to the onetomany communication for example a reply button in your email box a prepaid number bought from spark all the communication techniques proceeded to the public with bidirectional communication from mass communications onetoone this is the most intensive and interactive communication at a onetoone level there are so many examples like a sales presentation a negotiation in the market or direct delivery is base on the onetoone communication most of this communication is face to face but in the development of internet email and online shopping are taking place the chance to face to face of people which is provided the chance to sellers and buyers talk more directly another important is instant message chat channel like wechat and facebook which are becoming extremely popular in business manytomany on the background of highly developed internet the manytomany communication has been growing up such as online chat rooms blogging websites the manytomany communication stands for the participants are able to exchange their ideas and experiences after all each type of communication applies to different situation and is timebased the communications have the features of immediacy and longevity such as onetoone is more focus on now but the manytomay channels tend to less urgency and more reference psychology of communicationedit one of the primary goals of a marketing communication is to persuade consumers by either changing their perception of a brand product or service or persuading them to purchase or feel motivated  tempted to purchase a product or service the elaboration likelihood model is used to demonstrate how persuasion occurs when a marketing communication message is sent out first it must be acknowledged and attended by the receiver by giving their attention to the marketing communication consumers will begin to process and comprehend the message there are two routes to persuasion central route and peripheral route central route processing is used in highinvolvement purchase decisions these are infrequent highrisk purchases usually involving large amounts of money and a significant amount of time for example purchasing a house or car because these purchase decisions are high risk a large cognitive effort is expended in order to rationally select the most logical and valuable option available in these marketing messages information about the product or service itself is most valuable peripheral route processing is employed in low involvement purchase decisions these are frequent lowrisk purchases generally of a low or medium cost in which choices are made more on affective or emotion based values rather than cognitive or rational values because of this marketing messages will employ more storytelling and imagery focusing on how the product or service makes one feel and the associations it has rather than the attributes and specifications it possesses opinion leaders opinion leaders are consumers who have large influence over the purchasing behaviour of other consumers these can take the form of peers or celebrities and often represent a desired state in the eye of the influenced consumer by following the consumption patterns of opinion leaders consumers aspire to achieve a similar status or lifestyle and project a similar image because of this opinion leaders are powerful factors in marketing communications having opinion leaders endorse a brand can increase brand awareness and sales due to this large companies pay highly influential celebrities to endorse their products opinion formers opinion formers are consumers who are regarded by their peers as being highly knowledgeable and trustworthy they are considered experts in selecting the highest quality products due to their extensive knowledge and as such are able to influence the purchasing behaviour of other consumers despite lacking the celebrity status of an opinion leader communication barriers communication barriers are factors that hinder the effectiveness of a marketing communication major communication barriers are noise and clutter consumer apathy brand parity and weak creative ideas or strategies noise is an unrelated sensory stimulus that distracts a consumer from the marketing message for example people talking nearby making it hard to hear a radio advertisement clutter is the high number and concentration of advertisements presented to a consumer at any time as attention cannot be divided there is a limit to how much can be taken in and processed which means that a strong marketing communication needs to stand out from the clutter and be heard above the noise ang  principles of integrated marketing communications page  consumer apathy is the tendency of a consumer to avoid marketing communications this can be for a number of reasons the consumer may not be interested or consider themselves in the market and as such attempt to shut out the irrelevant marketing stimuli this is known as selective attention alternatively a consumer may be in the market yet not be aware of the brand or products existence or prevalence consumers tend to purchase familiar brands and will not be inspired to investigate alternatives one approach marketers use to overcome apathy is to create incentives such as competitive pricing or loyalty rewards ang  principles of integrated marketing communications page  brand parity means a brand is not significantly different from its competition without a distinct value proposition consumers do not develop brand preference or associations and instead purchase purely based on price ang  principles of integrated marketing communications page  this is not ideal as effective marketing communication increases brand equity one important objective of marketing communications is to develop a strong unique brand identity that allows the brand to be positioned separate from its competition marketing mixedit main article marketing mix marketing mix is the most important part of marketing strategy which is the framework to manage marketing and incorporate it within a business context refer to the marketing strategy it is to identify how the business achieves their marketing objective and the service they want to deliver to their customers and the initial step to achieve the marketing strategy to identify the market target and build up plan that the business should implement also the business has to make sure every step of achieving marketing target is running effectively one false step could cause a bad influence to the whole business after all this is a reason why the business needs marketing mix communication processedit communication can be defined as process of using word sound or visual cues to supply information to one or more people a communication process is defined as information that is shared with the intent that the receiver understands the message that the business intended to send the communication process was once thought of as having the source of the message which is then encoded put through the chosen communication channel which is then decoded by the recipient and then received throughout the middle of the channel there is the potential for noise to distort the message being sent once the receiver has the message they then give feedback to the original source where they then find out whether the campaign has been successful or not transactional model of communication in present times with the prevalent use of technology customers are seeking out information about brands products and businesses prior to purchase this means that there is a need for an additional channel within the communication process so it is a more accurate representation of the current business environment businesses are now having to take into consideration that both opinion leaders and opinion formers who have a great influence over todays society and their perceptions so they have to be included into the communication process before the recipient of the message receives it source the source is an individual or organization that has information to share the source or sender creates and sends the information to another person or group of people the source maybe an individual eg a sales person or spokesperson or a nonpersonal identity eg a corporation or organization the communication process begins with the source marketers must carefully choose a source as it affects how the message will be perceived by the target audience encoding this is transposing the intended meaning of the message with words symbols or pictures to show a message encoding is the development of the message that contains the information the source hopes to convey it is putting together the thoughts ideas and information into a symbolic form that can be transmitted and understood by the receiver encoding the message is the second step in the communication process the encoding process leads to development of a message that contains the information or meaning the source hopes to convey encoding is extremely important it is a brain activity that takes effect when the receiver makes sense of a brand message or idea used to convey meaning words colour pictures signs symbols or even music the message may be verbal or nonverbal oral or written or symbolic eg the sound of a brass band being redolent of simpler times or heritage or it can often include cues such as the nike swoosh which indicates success often things can get in the way of the correct encoding and the interpretation of the intended message decoding there are methods the sender can use to make sure the receiver interprets the message correctly these methods include channels consumer insights having similarities with the receiver and frame of reference eg age values culture finally it is extremely important for the sender to get to know its receiver and this is accomplished through research for targeting strategy these concepts help craft the intended message in the minds of the consumer message the message comes from the encoding process it is the content meaning or information the sources hopes to convey the message can be in many forms such as verbal nonverbal oral written or symbolic decoding the receiver unravels the symbols to interpret what is being communicated transforming the senders message back into thought this is influenced greatly by the receivers frame of reference or realm of understanding which involves their values attitudes and state of mind when receiving the message for the model to be effective the decoding by the receiver would match the encoding by the source meaning they correctly understand the message that was sent the third stage of the marketing communication process occurs when a channel or medium delivers the message generally receivers are the consumers in the target market or audience who read hear andor see the marketers message and decode it decoding is the process of interpreting messages and relies on correct encoding and the ability of the receiver to deconstruct transmitted meaning decoding occurs when the message reaches one or more of the receivers senses consumers both hear and see television ads others consumers handle touch and read see an advertising offer eg coupon according to belch  belch this process is deeply influenced by the receivers frame of reference or field of experience which refers to the experiences perceptions attitudes and values he or she brings to the communication situation for effective communication to occur the message decoding process of the receiver must match the encoding of the sender over this entire means the receiver comprehends and correctly translates what the source is trying to communicate effective communication is more likely to emerge when there is some common ground between the two parties the more familiarity the sender has about the receivers the better the sender can understand their needs commiserate with them and over all communicate more effectively opinion leaders and opinion formersedit opinion leaders are people who are either celebrities or a peer that has the ability to influence someone elses opinionperception opinion leaders nd you can receive the opinion leaders thoughts or feeling towards the productservice through paid advertising social media blogs or any other form of written media these can be direct or indirect influences opinion formers are people that have specialized knowledge about the area which corresponds with the product service or business opinion formers nd this can be a doctor sponsoring a form of medication or a personal trainer recommending a sports brand to the customer this means that both opinion leaders and opinion formers have a large influence on the consumer and their perceived view of the business product or service provided if a brand is specializing in the sale and manufacturing of makeup products the business would want to look at someone who is both known for their knowledge about makeup and also someone who they know is popular within that community so that the message is as wide spread throughout their target market as possible receiver the individual s that the source shares thoughts or information with the receiver hears sees or reads the message and decodes it noise noise is any external interference during this communication process any external factors that creates unplanned distortion this distortion can make it difficult for the receiver to interpret or assign meaning to a message as it was intended by the source examples of noise in the encoding of the message could be lack of radio or television signal noise can also occur when the sender and receivers fields of experience do not overlap if there is no common ground between them which may result in a misunderstanding in the meaning of the message throughout the communication process the message is subject to irrelevant factors that can distort or interfere with its reception noise is the physical or psychological fundamentals either from inside or outside of the process of communication noise acts as a barrier as it makes the message less accurate less productive and unclear it may even prevent the message from ever reaching the receiver physical noise is often triggered by badly made images or messages eg poor print quality or elements of distraction eg consumer scrolling through tv advertisements psychological noise could be mixed meanings poor credibility of source or the insignificance of the message to the consumer requirements not having a connection with the receiver and lacking in common ground usually cause this this may result in unsuitable encoding of the message such as using a sign symbol or word that is unfamiliar or has different meaning to the receiver eg sending a message in foreign language that is not understood by the receiver the more common ground there is between the sender and the receiver the less likely it is for noise and barriers to interrupt a message responsefeedback the receivers reaction to the message provides feedback to the sender this is the set of reactions after seeing hearing or reading the message the receivers response is the feedback and lets the sender know how the message was decoded and received a form of feedback in an interpersonal selling situation could be questions comments or any reactions such as expressions about the message in mass media an indication of how the marketing communications were perceived is the amount of sales after the message has been sent there are many different ways such as attitude change store visits and inquires that provide feedback in mass media feedback can help to improve the communication process and the success of future messages the receivers particular type of reactions after seeing hearing or reading a message is known as a response receivers responses can range from either non noticeable actions or noticeable actions non noticeable responses can be storing their information in memory and noticeable responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television one of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received to achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response or assist the receiver in giving the response receiving feed back can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received while the critical form of feedback happens through sales it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior so marketers visit stores check coupon redemption use reply cards and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback once a significant amount of feedbackresponse study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments channeledit the channel is the method by which the communication travels from the source or sender to the receiver there are two types of channels personal and nonpersonal personal channels of communication are direct and target individual groups personal communication channels are connected with two or more persons who communicate directly with each other facetoface persontoperson through telephone email or fax social channels also fall under the category of personal communications friends neighbors associates coworkers or family members are all means of social channels carrying a message without interpersonal contact between sender and receiver is known as nonpersonal channels of communication mass media or mass communications are examples of nonpersonal channels since the message is sent to many individuals at one time nonpersonal channels of communication are made up out of two main types the first being print print media includes newspapers magazines direct mail and billboards the second type is broadcast broadcast media includes radio and television this model is more effective when there is common ground between the senders and receivers so they can communicate effectively choosing the appropriate source helps develop the message and appeal to the targeted audience the source will be more effective if they are relatable to the target audience this realm of understanding is represented by the overlapping circles the more knowledge the source has about who they are targeting the better they can understand how the receiver may interpret or react to the message the core model of communication has been criticized for its linearity – sender message receiver and its absence of structural perception since then an adjusted model of communication has developed adjusted model of communicationsedit the adjusted model of communication was developed within a marketing context when marketers saw that people were affected more by influential homophilous groups family and friends and heterophilous groups outside the persons network than mass media dahlen  the adjusted model is different to the core model of communication because it incorporates opinion leaders also known as gate keepers opinion leaders are perceived to be of a higher social status a socialite and of high influence in their peer groups opinion leaders do not have the same authority as opinion formers opinion formers also known as change agents have formal influence over groups of people they provide an expert opinion or recommendation in their profession both opinion leaders and opinion formers have influence over the opinions of others this article may contain too much repetition or redundant language please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements january  opinion leaders add another link in the communication process acting as a meaning filter for the receivers of the message dahlen  the message is sent from the sender and the opinion leaders share their opinions with the targeted audience integrated marketing communications imcedit main article integrated marketing communications integrated marketing communications imc is a communication process that entails the planning creation integration and implementation of diverse forms of marketing communications imc unifies and coordinates the organizations marketing communications to promote a consistent brand message coordinating the brands communications makes the brand seem more trustworthy and sound as it is seen as a whole rather than a mixture of different messages being sent out the imc perspective looks at the big picture in marketing advertising and promotions traditional mediaedit traditional media include broadcast channels television radio and cinema print newspaper magazine books directories and public advertising such as billboards posters and public transport tv radio and print remain the largest media to advertise in accounting for approximately  of all media expenditure these are known as traditional media as they have existed effectively for the longest the effectiveness of traditional media is its ability to reach large numbers of people for this reason it is also referred to as mass media televisionedit television has since its inception dominated the advertising media scene due to its combination of visual and aural stimulation allowing for greater attention grabbing and more effective transmission of messages than other forms of media this makes it a strong choice for a marketer wishing to increase brand awareness most homes in developed countries have at least one television which makes it an ideal choice for reaching consumers however there are a few disadvantages television commercials suffer from being zipped and zapped zipping is the term given to fast forwarding commercial break sessions during the prerecording of programs often viewers will record programs purely so they can be viewed without the commercial breaks zapping is the term given to the habit of many consumers to change channels during commercial breaks this is also done to avoid watching advertisements using television advertisements is beneficial due to its wide reach and the degree to which content can be segmented according to the intended target market advertisements are carefully paired with time segments and  or linked with appropriate programming known as media vehicles this helps to ensure the intended audience is being reached with the marketing message ang  principles of integrated marketing communications page  radioedit despite being the oldest form of media transmission still being used marketing via radio remains a popular and effective choice due to its relatively lower cost and convenience one may watch television ads in the comfort of their home only while radio exposure can occur additionally during transit at work and during recreational activities such as shopping due to the lack of a visual aspect radio advertising attempts to create imagery in the consumers mind radio advertising is also extremely effective at reinforcing messages encountered in other channels such as television ang  principles of integrated marketing communications page  a familiar jingle or voice associated with a brand enhances brand and ad awareness ultimately increasing brand equity this is an example of integrated marketing communications in which multiple marketing channels are simultaneously utilized to increase the strength and reach of the marketing message like television radio marketing benefits from the ability to select specific time slots and programmes in this case in the form of radio stations and segments within printedit printed media is the most basic form of media advertising it is the most challenging to create strong imagery with due to its lack of sensory stimulation but can be effective in efficient clear information communication and message delivery where a consumer may miss a message in video or audio perhaps a loud noise interrupts or someone blocks their view in print the message remains visible indefinitely aspects such as size colour and style can be used to increase effectiveness relative to other print advertisements which is important as despite being a basic media communication channel print is the second largest medium after television ang  principles of integrated marketing communications page  traditionally marketing communications practitioners focused on the creation and execution of printed marketing collateral traditional media or as some refer to as old media has been used within the marketing and advertising world for many years traditional media encompasses conventional forms of advertising media such as television magazines newspapers radio and direct mail and outdoor for many decades these forms of communication have been the main source for marketers to reach both consumers and other companies in a world with no internet and the vast world of social media roots of advertising and promotion lie within traditional media where there is a more direct physical way of advertising in traditional advertising and promotion in terms of media it usually conveys of having a physical display or action to channel the senders message advertising in the form of print is used by businesses in the form of billboards magazines newspapers and posters to get their message across to the target audience the effectiveness of print relates back to aspects of the marketing mixs  ps print advertisement is in physical form the whereabouts of where u place the print will contribute to how effective it will reach the target audience businesses will usually place a billboard in areas where in can be easily seen and where the target audience will spend their daily activities newspaper magazines and posters are smaller in size and can be found in numerous places allowing the general public availability to read them depending on the product or service that is being advertised marketers may specify where majority of their prints may go to such as advertisement of a new shampoo may be more common within salons television and radio use physical actions to advertise which reaches the consumers senses of hearing or seeing or both these forms of traditional media channel the message intended by visually andor vocally communicating them to the consumer though traditional media is effective over the last few years there have been more and more businesses utilizing new media to reach its target audiences technology advancements have created new and efficient ways for marketers to reach consumers not just affecting modern media but also affecting the more traditional media traditional media is gradually losing effectiveness traditional media is becoming an increasingly less powerful mean of communicating with consumers and this change is driven by two key factors audience fragmentation and ability to choose commercial content television radio magazines and newspapers are becoming more fragmented and reaching smaller and more selective audiences the rapid growth of communication due to interactive media particularly the internet have caused the changes in the use of communication through media with businesses preferring to use modern media over more traditional media methods consumers no longer accept the faith they once had in conventional advertising placed in traditional media consumers cannot avoid new and innovative ways of communication the larger companies are realizing that to be able to survive in the st century they must adapt to new modern ways of advertising if they do not adapt competitors in their respective industries will make it more difficult for their business to survive many marketers believe that traditional methods of advertising have become too expensive and is not costeffective compared to modern media companies are looking to use lowercost more targeted means of communication such as direct mail sales promotions marketing and sponsorships and the most common in modern times the internet the internet is an interactive medium that is becoming an essential part of the communication strategies traditional forms of marketing communications such as advertising are one way in nature whereas new media allows marketers to perform a variety of functions interactive media such as internet cdroms kiosks and interactive television allow consumers to alter information and images given to them make inquiries respond to questions and make purchases the transition of marketing communications from applying traditional media to modern media has significantly influenced the success of the communication process interactive media allows marketers to interact with the audience easier and more efficiently it is a rapid procedure to communicate through interactive media to promote goods and services marketers can now channel their message to the target audience in a short span of time and a costefficient way advertising campaigns

open and flexible method of channeling communication communication platformsedit this section may be in need of reorganization to comply with wikipedias layout guidelines please help by editing the article to make improvements to the overall structure january  learn how and when to remove this template message during the last decade communication platforms like skype facebook or other types of medias have become extremely important means of communication although there are other methods of communications that arent just related to social media people can also be hugely influenced by their peers this process is known as social mediation marketing communication platforms are a powerful capability for personalizing and expending marketing contents in an automated fashion based on the profile of the recipients a platform by simplest definition is a raised floor or stage it functions as a similar principle in marketing communications providing awareness and information about a specific brand or product strategic selection of various communication platforms is known as a media strategy which aims to engage an audience in a meaningful conversation and as a result create a lasting relationship modern technology has expanded the use of platforms and ways in which consumers and the brand can interact as a result the context of platforms and how they are defined has changed there are various platforms by which communication is transmitted and these can be categorised as paid owned earned and shared formally named as the integrated communication triangle by grönroos and lindbergrepo the model acknowledges that communication must be credible and trustworthy to be effective studies reveal many consumers look at review forums and ask friends or peers whom they trust for ratings on products before making a purchase decision therefore effective communication relies on an integrated approach of one dimensional and interactive platforms explicitly planned market content is communicated through nonpersonal communication platforms the brand is in control of the platform message content frequency and repetition of the communication message this is typically accomplished through traditional paid platforms such as print electronic outdoor and alternative media that aims to target a mass segment of the target market print media includes newspapers and magazines these publications are a highly customizable and vary in print size font positioning and colour combination newspapers commonly use coarse paper and tend to have poor reproduction quality while magazines can enhance the appearance of a certain product due to the heavy weight gloss paper used which translates colour well and offers a long lasting quality and likeability magazines function as a frame a psychological device which manipulates perspective and judgement for example vogue a leading paid circulation fashion magazine publishes advertising efforts alongside beautiful imagery and elegant photography the association of the two communicates respectability and sophistication and promotes the creditability of the brands which appear in the same publication due to the highquality reproduction magazines tend to last longer and are often found in hair salons and waiting rooms consumers often cut out individual images which further prolongs the message and increases potential exposure although the relevance of the message may be lost during this extended time brand awareness may still be raised this article may contain too much repetition or redundant language please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements january  magazines are often segmented by subject such as womens health automotive or fashion and therefore effectively reach a particular target market while newspapers focus on geographical regions which tend to appeal to a broad representative population sample and therefore offer low impact in selectivity newspapers are often run on a weekly schedule offering up to date information and coverage of local events and businesses as a lower coast alternative such advertisements in smaller typeface and are black and white electronic media likewise a paid platform includes radio and television radio by definition is the broadcasting of sound programmes to the public and today can be live streamed through a broadband connection or digitally transmitted into peoples cars or homes fill et al acknowledges radio communication promotes emotional consumer–centric associations as each listener is forced to construct a visual representation of the words and sounds such as music in their minds a common technique used by companies is known as imagery transfer where a complementary visual television advertisement is used alongside a onedimensional radio advertisement featuring a similar audio track to stimulate a visual association between the two research suggests this subconscience relational thought process greatly benefits future brand recognition and awareness this article may contain too much repetition or redundant language please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements january  television and radio channel options have significantly increased in the last decade and are therefore a selective and deeply segmented communication platform furthermore a brand can select which time of the day certain advertisements are to be played for example during rush hour both television and radio commercials are often efficient to produce while initial production costs of a television advertisement are high it is likely to reach a mass audience and therefore maintains a low cost per viewer making it an efficient communication platform likewise radio infomercials are often a simple script that is read out by the presenter this is quick and does not require extensive lead times due to minimal production efforts the biggest downfall of electronic media is its function as background noise for example many listen to the radio while cooking and cleaning while others switch between television channels to avoid advertisements this may limit the effectiveness of reach and frequency and therefore message recall this article may contain too much repetition or redundant language please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements january  other aspects of noise decrease the effectiveness of message penetration for example most paid communication platforms print and electronic media are filled with marketing and advertising messages and are subject to clutter often forcing brands to compete for attention to eliminate noise brands often choose to include inserts such as samples and scent strips within magazines while newspapers utilise call to action inserts such as coupons which encourage consumers to visit or try a local service or good due to the rise in advertising clutter there has been a push for nontraditional media such as guerrilla marketing guerrilla marketing is usually a lowcost way of generating buzz through creative or unexpected communication platforms it is often outdoors which has the potential to gain attention from a large sum of the audience for example customising street infrastructure or creating an even such as a flash mob research rates guerrilla advertising as having a higher perceived value compared to other communication platforms which tends to result in a positive consumer response an example of successful guerrilla marketing was created by volkswagen vw in their promotional driven by fun campaign where consumers could use vw fast lane slide instead of the escalator to get to the bottom of the stairs faster every point of contact is a form of communication and it is therefore necessary to consider touch points as a communication platform touch points are owned communication and can be either physical or a human interaction between a brand and the consumer which influence customer decisionmaking process during prepurchase purchase and postpurchase there are many ways in which a customer may interact with a business interactions occur through direct customer service exchanges a company website the point of purchase environment and product packaging or performance these all contribute to consumer perceptions of a particular brand for instance the servicescape of a purchase touch point such as a retail store can influence the perception of quality and service through lighting and layout or other sensory touch points for example smell fast fashion retailers such as topshop maintain a white store interior and exterior which is perceived as luxurious likewise the higher price point and packaging of ferrero rocher may communicate sophistication and better quality visual appearance can have a significant effect on purchase decision companies such as coke a cola and pepsi provide a free fridge to distributors to control how products are displayed at the point of purchase in contrast united airlines is an example of how poor utilisation of postpurchase customer service can have an adverse effect on company reputation while boarding a united airlines flight dave carroll saw baggage handlers on the tarmac damage his guitar taylor after failed attempts to solve the issue through customer service carroll uploaded a humorous youtube video titled united breaks guitars which has experienced significant viewership and currently holds over  million views reportedly united faced a significant drop in the stock market carrolls youtube video is an example of the multiplier effect and how consumer attributes are shared through usergenerated content ugc networks and word of mouth communication research shows customer are more likely to pass on negative experiences and therefore such interactive platforms of communication have a significant impact on purchase decisions and brand outlook this links to the new trend in consumer behaviour and integration of marketing communications where technological developments have enabled socially mediated communication the dynamics of communication platforms has changed from oneway flow where companies were in control of the message to a continuum dialogue where businesses interact with consumers in a cocreative process as andy lark commonwealth bank cmo states the power has shifted we are now entering a transparent age where there are no secrets traditional single step communication was business to consumer orientated where users took a passive role in the process with little feedbackfurther studies have shown consumers are more likely to find interpersonal communication from influential people like family and friends more credible than mass media such influential people are known as opinion leaders and formers who maintain a high social standing within a given group or hold expert knowledge for example a doctor these further developments highlight the importance of opinion leaders as can be seen in the twostep linear model of communication purposed by roger where opinion leaders function as intermediaries by interpreting and filtering information to their followers these traditional models view paid media platforms as the primary source of information however this has changed due to technological developments in communication platforms which enable dialogue among consumers within a consumercentric communication from which meaning is constructed this multidimensional nonlinear flow of communication allows a many to many exchanges of information through platforms such as ugc ugc includes all the ways in which people publish creative content publicly online through blogs chats forums online platforms for product reviews and social media websites such as facebook youtube and instagram this is known as earned and shared media nike is an example of how such earned and shared media has created cocreation due to a shift in the consumer relationship through customer empowerment nike id is an online application that allows customers to design their shoe and therefore just do it online therefore interactive media is highly critical to integrated marketing communication as it may benefit organizations by engages with valuable customers and may encourage positive word of mouth communications studies show that marketgenerated media is still an important communication platform and information source consumers tend to consider both marketgenerated and ugc when making a purchase decision particularly for higher involvement product like vinyl albums however the movement from traditional media to various forms of online and ugc marketing is a rising trend and academics recognize that marketing communication is an open system and customer attributes are influenced by multiple aspects of business surroundings through various communication platforms

crosses this solved the issue of knowing whos cow belonged to who branding is an extremely important communication platform in the marketing communication process if a company brand isnt effectively communicated customers could easily become confused and possibly give their attention to another organization  branding goes beyond having a logo its how businesses communicate on behalf of their company verbally and visually a brand is a conversation it is how people talk about your company when you are not in the room consumers are constantly interacting and meeting with brands this can be through television or other media advertisements such as event sponsorships personal selling and product packaging brand exposure such as this is known as a brand touch point or brand contact whereby

teleconnection earth station at the satellite communication facility in raisting bavaria germany visualization from the opte project of the various routes through a portion of the internet telecommunication is the transmission of signs signals messages words writings images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire radio optical or other electromagnetic systems telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology it is transmitted either electrically over physical media such as cables or via electromagnetic radiation such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing the term is often used in its plural form telecommunications because it involves many different technologiescitation needed early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals such as beacons smoke signals semaphore telegraphs signal flags and optical heliographs other examples of premodern longdistance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats lungblown horns and loud whistles th and st century technologies for longdistance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies such as telegraph telephone and teleprinter networks radio microwave transmission fiber optics and communications satellites a revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by guglielmo marconi who won the nobel prize in physics in  other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications include charles wheatstone and samuel morse inventors of the telegraph

etymologyedit the word telecommunication is a compound of the greek prefix tele τηλε meaning distant far off or afar and the latin communicare meaning to share its modern use is adapted from the french because its written use was recorded in  by the french engineer and novelist édouard estaunié communication was first used as an english word in the late th century it comes from old french comunicacion c modern french communication from latin communicationem nominative communicatio noun of action from past participle stem of communicare to share divide out communicate impart inform join unite participate in literally to make common from communis historyedit for more details on this topic see history of telecommunication beacons and pigeonsedit a replica of one of chappes semaphore towers homing pigeons have occasionally been used throughout history by different cultures pigeon post had persian roots and was later used by the romans to aid their military frontinus said that julius caesar used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of gaul the greeks also conveyed the names of the victors at the olympic games to various cities using homing pigeons in the early th century the dutch government used the system in java and sumatra and in  paul julius reuter started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between aachen and brussels a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed in the middle ages chains of beacons were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information so the meaning of the message such as the enemy has been sighted had to be agreed upon in advance one notable instance of their use was during the spanish armada when a beacon chain relayed a signal from plymouth to london in  claude chappe a french engineer built the first fixed visual telegraphy system or semaphore line between lille and paris however semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres six to nineteen miles as a result of competition from the electrical telegraph the last commercial line was abandoned in  telegraph and telephoneedit sir charles wheatstone and sir william fothergill cooke invented the electric telegraph in  also the first commercial electrical telegraph is purported to have been constructed by wheatstone and cooke and opened on  april citation needed both inventors viewed their device as an improvement to the existing electromagnetic telegraph not as a new device samuel morse independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on  september  his code was an important advance over wheatstones signaling method the first transatlantic telegraph cable was successfully completed on  july  allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time the conventional telephone was invented independently by alexander bell and elisha gray in  antonio meucci invented the first device that allowed the electrical transmission of voice over a line in  however meuccis device was of little practical value because it relied upon the electrophonic effect and thus required users to place the receiver in their mouth to hear what was being said the first commercial telephone services were setup in  and  on both sides of the atlantic in the cities of new haven and london radio and televisionedit in  james lindsay gave a classroom demonstration of wireless telegraphy to his students by  he was able to demonstrate a transmission across the firth of tay from dundee scotland to woodhaven a distance of two miles  km using water as the transmission medium in december  guglielmo marconi established wireless communication between st johns newfoundland canada and poldhu cornwall england earning him the  nobel prize in physics which he shared with karl braun however smallscale radio communication had already been demonstrated in  by nikola tesla in a presentation to the national electric light association on  march  john logie baird was able to demonstrate the transmission of moving pictures at the london department store selfridges bairds device relied upon the nipkow disk and thus became known as the mechanical television it formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the british broadcasting corporation beginning  september  however for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by karl braun the first version of such a television to show promise was produced by philo farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on  september  computers and the internetedit on  september  george stibitz transmitted problems for his complex number calculator in new york using a teletype and received the computed results back at dartmouth college in new hampshire this configuration of a centralized computer mainframe with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the s however already in the s researchers started to investigate packet switching a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe a fournode network emerged on  december  constituting the beginnings of the arpanet which by  had grown to  nodes arpanet eventually merged with other networks to form the internet while internet development was a focus of the internet engineering task force ietf who published a series of request for comment documents other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories such as the local area network lan developments of ethernet  and the token ring protocol  key conceptsedit modern telecommunication is founded on a series of key concepts that experienced progressive development and refinement in a period of well over a century basic elementsedit telecommunication technologies may primarily be divided into wired and wireless methods overall though a basic telecommunication system consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another a transmitter that takes information and converts it to a signal a transmission medium also called the physical channel that carries the signal an example of this is the free space channel a receiver that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back into usable information for the recipient for example in a radio broadcasting station the stations large power amplifier is the transmitter and the broadcasting antenna is the interface between the power amplifier and the free space channel the free space channel is the transmission medium and the receivers antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver next the radio receiver is the destination of the radio signal and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to sometimes telecommunication systems are duplex twoway systems with a single box of electronics working as both the transmitter and a receiver or a transceiver for example a cellular telephone is a transceiver the transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other this can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in watts or kilowatts but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the microwatts or nanowatts hence transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their highpower circuitry and their lowpower circuitry from each other as to not cause interference telecommunication over fixed lines is called pointtopoint communication because it is between one transmitter and one receiver telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous lowpower but sensitive radio receivers telecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems the sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver analog versus digital communicationsedit communications signals can be sent either by analog signals or digital signals there are analog communication systems and digital communication systems for an analog signal the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information in a digital signal the information is encoded as a set of discrete values for example a set of ones and zeros during the propagation and reception the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise the output of a transmitter is noisefree for all practical purposes commonly the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way this form of noise is called additive noise with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here on the other hand unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold the information contained in digital signals will remain intact their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals telecommunication networksedit a telecommunications network is a collection of transmitters receivers and communications channels that send messages to one another some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user an analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users for both types of network repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances this is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise another advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory ie two voltage states high and low are easier to store than a continuous range of states communication channelsedit the term channel has two different meanings in one meaning a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver examples of this include the atmosphere for sound communications glass optical fibers for some kinds of optical communications coaxial cables for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them and free space for communications using visible light infrared waves ultraviolet light and radio waves this last channel is called the free space channel the sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two radio waves travel through a perfect vacuum just as easily as they travel through air fog clouds or any other kind of gas the other meaning of the term channel in telecommunications is seen in the phrase communications channel which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously for example one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of  mhz megahertz while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of  mhz each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about  khz kilohertz centered at frequencies such as the above which are called the carrier frequencies each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by  khz and the difference between  khz and  khz  khz is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system in the example above the free space channel has been divided into communications channels according to frequencies and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves this system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called frequencydivision multiplexing another term for the same concept is wavelengthdivision multiplexing which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time a time slot for example  milliseconds out of each second and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot this method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called timedivision multiplexing tdm and is used in optical fiber communication some radio communication systems use tdm within an allocated fdm channel hence these systems use a hybrid of tdm and fdm modulationedit the shaping of a signal to convey information is known as modulation modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform this is commonly called keying – a term derived from the older use of morse code in telecommunications – and several keying techniques exist these include phaseshift keying frequencyshift keying and amplitudeshift keying the bluetooth system for example uses phaseshift keying to exchange information between various devices in addition there are combinations of phaseshift keying and amplitudeshift keying which is called in the jargon of the field quadrature amplitude modulation qam that are used in highcapacity digital radio communication systems modulation can also be used to transmit the information of lowfrequency analog signals at higher frequencies this is helpful because lowfrequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space hence the information from a lowfrequency analog signal must be impressed into a higherfrequency signal known as the carrier wave before transmission there are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this two of the most basic being amplitude modulation am and frequency modulation fm an example of this process is a disc jockeys voice being impressed into a  mhz carrier wave using frequency modulation the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel  fm in addition modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing fdm societyedit telecommunication has a significant social cultural and economic impact on modern society in  estimates placed the telecommunication industrys revenue at  trillion or just under  percent of the gross world product official exchange rate several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society economic impactedit microeconomicsedit on the microeconomic scale companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires this is selfevident in the case of online retailer amazoncom but according to academic edward lenert even the conventional retailer walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors in cities throughout the world home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage in bangladeshs narshingdi district isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods in côte divoire coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price macroeconomicsedit on the macroeconomic scale larshendrik röller and leonard waverman suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth few dispute the existence of a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal because of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this is known as the digital divide a  survey by the international telecommunication union itu revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every  people and onethird of countries have fewer than one landline telephone subscription for every  people in terms of internet access roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of  people with internet access from this information as well as educational data the itu was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies using this measure sweden denmark and iceland received the highest ranking while the african countries nigeria burkina faso and mali received the lowest social impactedit telecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships nevertheless devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device such as the ability to conduct business or order home services as opposed to the social dimensions it was not until the late s and s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements new promotions started appealing to consumers emotions stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends since then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important in recent years the popularity of social networking sites has increased dramatically these sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs events and profiles for others to see the profiles can list a persons age interests sexual preference and relationship status in this way these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to courtship prior to social networking sites technologies like short message service sms and the telephone also had a significant impact on social interactions in

international frequency list and used in conformity with the radio regulation according to the itus radio regulations adopted in atlantic city all frequencies referenced in the international frequency registration board examined by the board and registered on the international frequency list shall have the right to international protection from harmful interference from a global perspective there have been political debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting the history of broadcasting discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting the onset of world war ii brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda countries their governments insurgents terrorists and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mids in  the bbc broadcast propaganda to the arab world to partly counter similar broadcasts from italy which also had colonial interests in north africa modern insurgents such as those in the latest iraq war often use intimidating telephone calls smss and the distribution of sophisticated videos of an attack on coalition troops within hours of the operation the sunni insurgents even have their own television station alzawraa which while banned by the iraqi government still broadcasts from erbil iraqi kurdistan even as coalition pressure has forced it to switch satellite hosts several times on  november  president obama recommended the federal communications commission reclassify broadband internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality modern

connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges the switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number once the connection is made the callers voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the callers handset this electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that persons handset the landline telephones in most residential homes are analog—that is the speakers voice directly determines the signals voltagecitation needed although shortdistance calls may be handled from endtoend as analog signals increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission the advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel sidebyside with data from the internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise mobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixedline subscriptions in many markets sales of mobile phones in  totalled  million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of asiapacific  m western europe  m cemea central europe the middle east and africa  m north america  m and latin america  m in terms of new subscriptions over the five years from  africa has outpaced other markets with  growth increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as gsm or wcdma with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as amps there have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes starting with the operation of tat in  the s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers the benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity tat itself was able to carry  times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and todays optic fibre cables are able to carry  times as many telephone calls as tat this increase in data capacity is due to several factors first optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies second they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable lastly improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre assisting communication across many modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as asynchronous transfer mode atm the atm protocol allows for the sidebyside data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph it is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway the traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection this is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate something that will ensure a callers voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely there are competitors to atm such as multiprotocol label switching mpls that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant atm in the future radio and televisionedit main articles radio television and broadcasting digital television standards and their adoption worldwide in a broadcast system the central highpowered broadcast tower transmits a highfrequency electromagnetic wave to numerous lowpowered receivers the highfrequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information the receiver is then tuned so as to pick up the highfrequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information the broadcast signal can be either analog signal is varied continuously with respect to the information or digital information is encoded as a set of discrete values the broadcast media industry is at a critical turning point in its development with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts this move is made possible by the production of cheaper faster and more capable integrated circuits the chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts for television this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures ghosting and other distortion these occur because of the nature of analog transmission which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output in a simplified example if a binary message  was transmitted with signal amplitudes     and received with signal amplitudes     it would still decode to the binary message  — a perfect reproduction of what was sent from this example a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission in digital television broadcasting there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide these are the atsc dvb and isdb standards the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map all three standards use mpeg for video compression atsc uses dolby digital ac for audio compression isdb uses advanced audio coding mpeg part  and dvb has no standard for audio compression but typically uses mpeg part  layer  the choice of modulation also varies between the schemes in digital audio broadcasting standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the digital audio broadcasting standard also known as the eureka  standard the exception is the united states which has chosen to adopt hd radio hd radio unlike eureka  is based upon a transmission method known as inband onchannel transmission that allows digital information to piggyback on normal am or fm analog transmissions however despite the pending switch to digital analog television remains being transmitted in most countries an exception is the united states that ended analog television transmission by all but the very lowpower tv stations on  june  after twice delaying the switchover deadlinekenya also ended analog television transmission in december  after multiple delays for analog television there are three standards in use for broadcasting color tv see a map on adoption here these are known as pal german designed ntsc north american designed and secam french designed it is important to understand that these are the ways of sending color tv and they do not have anything to do with the standards for black  white tv which also vary from country to country for analog radio the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers the choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude am or frequency modulation fm to achieve stereo playback an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo fm internetedit the osi reference model the internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the internet protocol any computer on the internet has a unique ip address that can be used by other computers to route information to it hence any computer on the internet can send a message to any other computer using its ip address these messages carry with them the originating computers ip address allowing for twoway communication the internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers it is estimated that the  of the information flowing through twoway telecommunications networks in the year  were flowing through the internet most of the rest  through the landline telephone by the year  the internet clearly dominated and captured  of all the information in telecommunication networks most of the rest  through mobile phones as of update an estimated  of the world population has access to the internet with the highest access rates measured as a percentage of the population in north america  oceaniaaustralia  and europe  in terms of broadband access iceland  south korea  and the netherlands  led the world the internet works in part because of protocols that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other the nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run moreorless independently of other protocols this allows lowerlevel protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higherlevel protocols operate a practical example of why this is important is because it allows an internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the internet through an ethernet or wifi connection protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the osi reference model pictured on the right which emerged in  as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite for the internet the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe this is because the internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used this leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation in practice most intercontinental communication will use the asynchronous transfer mode atm protocol or a modern equivalent on top of optic fiber this is because for most intercontinental communication the internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network at the network layer things become standardized with the internet protocol ip being adopted for logical addressing for the world wide web these ip addresses are derived from the human readable form using the domain name system eg  is derived from wwwgooglecom at the moment the most widely used version of the internet protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent at the transport layer most communication adopts either the transmission control protocol tcp or the user datagram protocol udp tcp is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas udp is used when it is merely desirable with tcp packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers with udp packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost both tcp and udp packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by because certain applicationlevel protocols use certain ports network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements examples are to restrict internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority above the transport layer there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers most notably the secure sockets layer ssl and transport layer security tls protocols these protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential finally at the application layer are many of the protocols internet users would be familiar with such as http web browsing pop email ftp file transfer irc internet chat bittorrent file sharing and xmpp instant messaging voice over internet protocol voip allows data packets to be used for synchronous voice communications the data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the realtime synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed ie file transfer or email or buffered in advance ie audio and video without detriment that prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the voip calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization ie a private corporate style network but the internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of voip calls over a private network and over the public internet local area networks and wide area networksedit despite the growth of the internet the characteristics of local area networks lanscomputer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct this is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more costeffective and efficient without them when they are not connected with the internet they also have the advantages of privacy and security however purposefully lacking a direct connection to the internet does not provide assured protection from hackers military forces or economic powers these threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the lan wide area networks wans are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers once again some of their advantages include privacy and security prime users of private lans and wans include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret in the mids several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the datalink layer and the application layer of the osi reference model these included appletalk ipx and netbios with the dominant protocol set during the early s being ipx due to its popularity with msdos users tcpip existed at this point but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities as the internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks the tcpip protocols replaced existing local area network technologies additional technologies such as dhcp allowed tcpipbased computers to selfconfigure in the network such functions also existed in the appletalk ipx netbios protocol sets whereas asynchronous transfer mode atm or multiprotocol label switching mpls are typical datalink protocols for larger networks such as wans ethernet and token ring are typical datalink protocols for lans these protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler eg they omit features such as quality of service guarantees and offer collision prevention both of these differences allow for more economical systems despite the modest popularity of ibm token ring in the s and s virtually all lans now use either wired or wireless ethernet facilities at the physical layer most wired ethernet implementations use copper twistedpair cables including the common baset networks however some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations especially highspeed ones use optical fibers when optic fibers are used the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and singlemode fibers multimode fibers can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer longdistance performance transmission capacityedit the effective capacity to exchange information worldwide through twoway telecommunication networks grew from  petabytes of optimally compressed information in  to  petabytes in  to  optimally compressed exabytes in  and to  optimally compressed exabytes in  this is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages per person per day in  and
