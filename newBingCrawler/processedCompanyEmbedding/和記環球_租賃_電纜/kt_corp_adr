so please refer to the presentation slides as we present this quarters business results please note that since the first quarter of  kt has been presenting consolidated numbers under the ifrs accounting standards from this quarter in line with the revised disclosure guidelines of msip on subscriber numbers while the subscriber calculation was based on number of total line basis which is inclusive of kt and mvno subscribers and other lines which are surveillance equipment ex the lines for the hybrid product also arpu calculation now excludes other lines that were unbilled and subscribers for the hybrid product such change was retroactively applied to q  data now i will invite our cfo gwangseok shin for his opening remarks and presentations on q  earnings results gwangseok shin good afternoon i am gwangseok shin kts cfo kt was able to maintain steady bottomline driven by enhanced competitiveness of our core businesses and our efforts to achieve structural cost efficiency our wireless business has seen sustained lte subscriber growth underpinned by customer centric management and stronger channel competitiveness fixed line business saw giga internet subscribers surpass mark with iptv subs acquisition of  million as such we are an unquestioned number one player in internet and iptv through its world class ict technology and giga infrastructure that integrates fixed and wireless network kt is able to provide the fastest and most innovative telecom and converged services leveraging ict based technologies kt is seeking to bring about conversion across various industries like advanced command and control cloud and big data by building intelligent giga infrastructure whose value goes beyond the boundary of current level of speed capacity and connectedness based on such technologies we are focusing on five future industries of smart energy healthcare next generation media integrated security and intelligent transportation control to facilitate market expansion of the converged business kt is intent on developing not just a bc model but also a bb and bg business models considering that the core of our future business is underpinned by the value of the platform dictated by the size of the subscriber base we expected kts future conversions business will start to become prominent starting  based on different conversions business models being sought after at this moment especially in the energy sector kt is the first in the world to have developed kt microenergy grid which is an integrated and efficient energy management system at the energy control center at mapo they predict energy demand for  sites around the world including hospitals hotels and industrial facilities using big data and the system allows for energy optimization through the conversions of production consumption and trading of energy resources kt also developed worlds first portable security platform called wiz stick that personalizes kts network security capabilities as one of its key initiative of its five future growth businesses in the integrated security segment wiz stick manages vulnerabilities at the network access level and not at the pc level thereby blocking pharming and other deceptive fraud attacks at its root and by providing fingerprint identification and strong modes of authentication we expect it will play an important role in leading the security market for financial and ecommerce transactions as well as for data protection kt is a telco that represents  years of koreas telecommunications history to live up to this legacy we will further reinforce growth potential and profitability of the telco business and focus on bringing tangible outcome in the future convergence business so as to lead the wave in the fourth industrial revolution and new ict paradigm now let me present on q  financial results q  operating revenue was down  year over year to krw billion and declines in fixed line and merchandize

on capital expenditure q  cumulative capex was krw billion and by the end of the year we plan to implement what remains of the krw trillion capex guidance i will now move on to each line of business wireless revenue came in at krw billion down  yearoveryear this was due to lower interconnect revenue as a result of lowering of interconnection fees and with the removal of the signup fee there was a decline in signup revenue but wireless service revenue on lt subs growth continued an upper trend posting  yearoveryear growth lt subscribers expanded to account for  of total subs with q arpu recording krw up  qoq next is on fixed line business fixed line revenue on pstn revenue decline was down  yearoveryear to krw billion pstn revenue declined  yearoveryear driven by declines in both subscribers and traffic volume despite growth in subscribers broadband internet revenue fell  yearoveryear due to offering of more benefits to consumers our subscribers for giga internet and giga wifi

than  net additions in q and as of q end there are  million subscribers other vas value added service revenue from media business including ppvs and ads are showing an uptrend as well by making use of
