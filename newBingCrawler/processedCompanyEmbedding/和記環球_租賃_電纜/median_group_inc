navigation search one possible model here if parties a and b want to catch the median voters they should move towards the center the red and blue areas represent the voters that a and b expect they have already captured the median voter theorem states that a majority rule voting system will select the outcome most preferred by the median voter the median voter theorem rests on two main assumptions with several others detailed below first the theorem assumes that voters can place all election alternatives along a onedimensional political spectrum it seems plausible that voters could do this if they can clearly place political candidates on a lefttoright continuum but this is often not the case as each party will have its own policy on each of many different issues similarly in the case of a referendum the alternatives on offer may cover more than one issue second the theorem assumes that voters preferences are singlepeaked which means that voters choose the alternative closest to their own view this assumption predicts that the further away the outcome is from the voters most preferred outcome the less likely the voter is to select that alternative it also assumes that voters always vote regardless of how far the alternatives are from their own views the median voter theorem implies that voters have an incentive to vote for their true preferences finally the median voter theorem applies best to a majoritarian election system contents  assumptions  explanations  history  accuracy  limitations  abstract social choice problem  cycling  arrows impossibility theorem  two common solutions  political  references  external links assumptionsedit example  of singlepeaked preferences example  of singlepeaked preferences example of multipeaked preferences for the median voter theorem to be successful there is a total of seven assumptions that are made as mentioned above  the first assumption is that there is singledimensional voting put simply this means that there is only one issue that is being voted on at a time additionally it is assumed that  voters preferences are singlepeaked which is just the notion that peoples preferences are a spectrum of utility with the strongest preference at the maximum see figures to the right this assumption is critical because it prevents a phenomenon called cycling which is detailed below the third assumption  is that voters are only choosing between two options this is important because when there are more than two choices for voters the median voter may not have voted for the most popular option for example in a population of  people voting between a b and c imagine  people vote for a  people vote for b and  people vote for c assuming a b and c lie on a spectrum ie a scale from liberal to neutral to conservative the median voter would have voted for b even though choice c was the most popular the fourth assumption  is that there is no ideology or influence with regards to the voting options essentially this means that politicians only care about maximizing votes not necessarily sticking true to their beliefs the fifth assumption  is that there is no selective voting and all eligible voters for an election will turn out to vote the sixth assumption  says that money and lobbying have no effect on elections because introducing these incentives can dramatically change voting patterns the final assumption  is the notion that all parties of elections have full information this means that voters have knowledge on the issues candidates have knowledge on the issues and candidates have knowledge on voter preferences explanationsedit to appreciate the logic of the median voter model consider a setting where three individuals al bob and charlie are to choose a restaurant for lunch al prefers a restaurant where lunch costs  bob favors somewhat better fare at a restaurant serving  lunches and charlie wants a gourmet restaurant where lunch will cost around  bob can be said to be the median voter because there are exactly the same number of people who prefer a more expensive restaurant than bob as there are who prefer a less expensive restaurant than bob here one each for convenience assume that given any two options each member of the lunch group prefers restaurants with prices closer to their preferred restaurant to those that are farther from it now consider some majority decisions over alternative restaurants options pattern of votes result  vs  a  b  c    vs  a  b  c    vs  a  b  c   the weak form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always casts his or her vote for the policy that is adopted note that bob always votes in favor of the outcome that wins the election note also that bobs preferred  restaurant will defeat any other if there is a median voter his or her preferred policy will beat any other alternative in a pairwise vote the median voters ideal point is always a condorcet winner consequently once the median voters preferred outcome is reached it cannot be defeated by another in a pairwise majoritarian election the strong form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always gets his most preferred policy the median voter theorem seems to explain some of the things that happen in majoritarian voting systems first it may explain why politicians tend to adopt similar platforms and campaign rhetoric in order to win the majority vote politicians must tailor their platforms to the median voter for example in the united states the democratic and republican candidates typically move their campaign platforms towards the middle during congressional election campaigns just as sellers in a free market try to win over their competitors customers by making slight changes to improve their products so too do politicians deviate only slightly from their opponents platform so as to gain votes second the median voter theorem reflects that radical candidates or parties rarely get elected for example a politician or party which is at an extreme end of the political spectrum will usually not get nearly as many votes as a more moderate party finally the theorem may explain why two major political parties tend to emerge in majoritarian voting systems duvergers law in the united states there are countless political parties but only two established major parties play a part in almost every major election the democratic and republican parties according to the median voter theorem third parties will rarely if ever win elections for the same reason why extreme candidates do not tend to win the major parties tend to coopt the platforms of the minor parties in order to secure more votes in many other longestablished democratic countries there are several parties who each get a substantial share of the vote although most of these have some form of proportional representation historyedit in his  paper titled stability in competition harold hotelling notes in passing that political candidates platforms seem to converge during majoritarian elections hotelling compared political elections to businesses in the private sector he postulated that just as there is often not much difference between the products of different competing companies so too there is not a stark contrast between electoral platforms of different parties this is because politicians just like salesmen with consumers seek to capture the majority of voters duncan black in his  paper titled on the rationale of group decisionmaking provided a formal analysis of majority voting that made the theorem and its assumptions explicit black wrote that he saw a large gap in economic theory concerning how voting determines the outcome of decisions including political decisions blacks paper thus triggered research on how economics can explain voting systems in  with his paper titled an economic theory of political action in democracy anthony downs expounded upon the median voter theorem accuracyedit several important economic studies strongly support the median voter theorem for example holcombe analyzes the bowen equilibrium level of education expenditures for  michigan school districts and finds that the actual expenditures are only about  away from the estimated district average the theorem also explains the rise in government redistribution programs over the past few decades thomas husted and lawrence w kenny examined growth of redistribution programs especially between the years of  and  tom rice also writes that voters with the median income will take advantage of their status as deciders by electing politicians who will tax those who are earning more than the median voter and then redistribute the money including to those who are at the median more specifically rice demonstrates that if a systematic closing of the gap between the median and mean income levels in the united states could be shown more credibility could be given to the median voter theorem until the mids rice says that the gap between median and mean income levels tightened three main forces served to tighten this gap first the strength of the democratic party in the united states congress in the decades leading up to the s as democrats are more disposed to redistribution of wealth second increased turnout at the polls just as husted and kenny postulated tightened the gap because an increase in voters means more individuals of lower income are voting finally since unemployment which causes median income families to fall below the median incomecitation needed was relatively low compared to after the s this tightened the gap limitationsedit abstract social choice problemedit how do we choose the best outcome from an election for society this question is the root of the median voter theorem and provides the basis for how and why this theorem was created it starts with the idea of a social decision rule essentially this is a tool that is used to aggregate preferences of all members of society that ultimately provides a clearcut and consistent answer for what outcome is most preferred this choice rests on three main principles that allow the most preferred social choice to be salient the first  is pareto dominance this is the idea that if society prefers one choice to all other choices the social decision should reflect this and this option will be the outcome the second principle  is a concept called transitivity which is analog to the mathematical property this phenomenon simply means that if option a is preferred to option b and option b is preferred to option c then option a is preferred to option c the final principle is the idea of independence of irrelevant alternatives this suggests that if something is not relevant to the election or the issues involved then it should not affect the outcome or results for example imagine there is a vote for the most valuable player in a baseball league and player a has the most votes player b has the second most and player c has the third most now say player c is disqualified for cheating  this should not change the outcome of the vote if the voting system was set up in a way in which aggregate votes are shifted and player b ends up with more votes this is not a consistent aggregation method cyclingedit if any of the abovementioned principles is violated it could result in cycling cycling happens when there is no clear winner from a majority vote that results in a constant cycle of trying to determine which outcome is most preferred this is a crucial concept because it exposes how majority voting in general and the median voter theorem can fail when assumptions are not met there are several more failures that come about from this model that stem from this phenomenon arrows impossibility theoremedit with the difficulties associated with aggregating societys preferences what are some alternatives that can be considered potentially members of society could simply vote for their first choice rather than rank their preferences alternatively there could be weights distributed based on the intensity and passion that members feel for specific issues both of these are problematic for several reasons including the frequent occurrences of ties in  kenneth arrow received the nobel prize in economics for a theorem based on these challenges with aggregating preferences consistently arrows impossibility theorem states that there is no general solution to the abstract social choice problem arrow had the insight to realize that numerous individuals of different demographics and geography cannot all have consistent and similar political socioeconomic or many other beliefs arrow found that the only way for the social choice problem to have a single solution was to either  restrict individual preferences to certain and specific bundles or  impose a dictatorship in reality it seems that the party system in the united states and in other countries restricts your political beliefs to one side or the other two common solutionsedit restrict preferences to single peaks meaning that individuals vote on a spectrum and allow the median voter theorem to be implemented naturallythis is essentially the function of the party system mentioned briefly above another common solution is to allow peoples intensities on issues play a factor in their vote this is difficult to achieve since both social welfare functions and the samuelson rule are necessary to calculate politicaledit in reality many of the assumptions of this model do not hold one assumption the theorem makes is that there is only single dimensional voting this is never true of government representatives  politicians do not only take stances on only one issue but rather several to test the median voter theorem further think about the senate if the median voter theorem holds it would mean that the two senators from a state should vote the same way every time because the median voter in the state would be the voter that chooses the outcome however when there is one democratic senator and one republican they typically vote opposite to each other effectively canceling each others votes the median voter theorem has several limitations keith krehbiel postulates that there are many factors which prevent the political process from reaching maximum efficiency just as transaction costs prevent efficiency in market exchanges the limitations of the majoritarian voting process stop it from reaching optimality with the median voter theorem in particular krehbiel argues that voters inability to directly amend legislation acts against the theorem sometimes as krehbiel writes the policies being voted on are too complex to be placed within a onedimensional continuum buchanan and tollison also note that this is a problem for the median voter theorem which assumes that decisions can be made on a onedimensional field if voters are considering more than one issue simultaneously the median voter theorem is inapplicable this may happen if for example voters may vote on a referendum regarding education spending and police spending simultaneously a larger problem for the median voter theorem however is the incentives structure for government representatives downs in a theory of bureaucracy writes that peoples decisions are motivated by selfinterest an idea deeply rooted in the writings of adam smith this holds for the government system as well because it is composed of individuals who are selfinterested one cannot guarantee the degree to which a government representative will be committed to the public good but it is certain that to some degree they will be committed to their own set of goals these goals can include a desire to serve the public interest but most often they include the desire for power income and prestige to continue obtaining these things then officials must secure reelection when representatives are constantly focused on becoming reelected this distorts the mandate they receive from their constituents representatives will translate the wishes of their constituents into benefits for themselves they will tend to vote for shortterm policies that they hope will get them reelected referencesedit  a b c holcombe randall g  public sector economics upper saddle river

median in sets of data with an odd and even number of values the median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample a population or a probability distribution from the lower half for a data set it may be thought of as the middle value for example in the data set  to obtain the mean the distribution of both the sample mean and the sample median were determined by laplace in the early s antoine augustin cournot in  was the firstcitation needed to use the term median valeur médiane for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves gustav theodor fechner used the median centralwerth in sociological and psychological phenomena it had earlier been used only in astronomy and related fields gustav fechner popularized the median into the formal analysis of data although it had been used previously by laplace francis galton used the english term median in  having earlier used the terms middlemost value in  and the medium in citation needed see alsoedit

lateral cord and medial cord innervates anterior compartment of the forearm with two exceptions thenar eminence lumbricals skin of the hand identifiers latin nervus medianus mesh mediannerve dorlands elsevier n ta a fma  anatomical terms of neuroanatomy edit on wikidata the median nerve is a nerve in humans and other animals in the upper limb it is one of the five main nerves originating from the brachial plexus the median nerve originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus and has contributions from ventral roots of cclateral cord and c  t medial cord the median nerve is the only nerve that passes through the carpal tunnel carpal tunnel syndrome is the disability that results from the median nerve being pressed in the carpal tunnel contents  structure  forearm  hand  variation  function  arm  forearm  hand  clinical significance  injury  additional images  see also  references  external links structureedit after receiving inputs from both the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus the median nerve enters the arm from the axilla at the inferior margin of the teres major muscle it then passes vertically down and courses with the brachial artery on the medial side of the arm between biceps brachii and brachialis at first it is lateral to the artery and lies anterior to the elbow joint it then crosses anteriorly to run medial to the artery in the distal arm and into the cubital fossa inside the cubital fossa the median nerve passes medial to the brachial artery in front of the point of insertion of the brachialis muscle and deep to the biceps the median nerve gives off an articular branch in the upper arm as it passes the elbow joint a branch to pronator teres may arise from the median nerve immediately proximal to the elbow joint forearmedit the median nerve arises from the cubital fossa and passes between the two heads of pronator teres it then travels between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus before emerging between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor pollicis longus the unbranched portion of the median nerve which arises from the cubital fossa innervates muscles of superficial and intermediate groups of the anteriorflexor compartment except flexor carpi ulnaris the median nerve does give off two branches as it courses through the forearm the anterior interosseous branch courses with the anterior interosseous artery and innervates all the muscles of the deep group of the anterior compartment of the forearm except the medial ulnar half which is supplied by ulnar nerve half of flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscle it ends with its innervation of pronator quadratus the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve arises at the distal part of the forearm it supplies sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the skin of the palm but not the digits handedit the median nerve enters the hand through the carpal tunnel deep to the flexor retinaculum along with the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus from there it sends off several branches  recurrent branch to muscles of the thenar compartment the recurrent branch is also called the million dollar nerve here it provides motor innervation to opponens pollicis abductor pollicis brevis and superficial part of flexor pollicis brevis  digital cutaneous branches to common palmar digital branch and proper palmar digital branch of the median nerve which supply the a lateral radial three and a half digits on the palmar side b dorsum of the tips of index middle and thumb  the median nerve supplies motor innervation to the first and second lumbricals of the hand variationedit there are multiple naturally occurring anomalies of the median nerve bifurcation of the median nerve typically occurs after the nerve exits the carpal tunnel however in a small percentage  of individuals the median nerve bifurcates more proximal in the carpal tunnel wrist or forearm during gestation a median artery that serves the hand retracts however in some individuals the median artery does not retract and follows the course next to the median nerve into the hand martingruber anastomoses can occur when branches of the median nerve crossover in the forearm and merge with the ulnar nerve to innervate portions of the forehand richecannieu anastomoses can occur when there is connection between recurrent branch of the median nerve and deep branch of the ulnar nerve of the hand functionedit armedit the median nerve has no voluntary motor or cutaneous function in the brachium it gives vascular branches to the wall of the brachial artery these vascular branches carry sympathetic fibers forearmedit it innervates all of the flexors in the forearm except flexor carpi ulnaris and that part of flexor digitorum profundus that supplies the nd and rd digits the latter two muscles are supplied by the ulnar nerve specifically the muscular branches of ulnar nerve the main portion of the median nerve supplies the following muscles superficial group pronator teres flexor carpi radialis palmaris longus intermediate group flexor digitorum superficialis muscle the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve supplies the following muscles deep group flexor digitorum profundus only the lateral half flexor pollicis longus pronator quadratus handedit the cutaneous innervation of the right hand areas supplied by the median nerve are colored green the radial nerve red and the ulnar nerve blue it appears that the borderline has been mistakenly drawn through the middle finger rather than through the ring finger on the dorsal side of the hand in the hand the median nerve supplies motor innervation to the st and nd lumbrical muscles it also supplies the muscles of the thenar eminence by a recurrent thenar branch the rest of the intrinsic muscles of the hand are supplied by the ulnar nerve the median nerve innervates the skin of the palmar side of the index the thumb and middle finger half the ring finger and the nail bed the lateral part of the palm is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve which leaves the nerve proximal to the wrist creases this palmar cutaneous branch travels in a separate fascial groove adjacent to the flexor carpi radialis and then superficial to the flexor retinaculum it is therefore spared in carpal tunnel syndrome the muscles of the hand supplied by the median nerve can be remembered using the mnemonic loaf for lumbricals    opponens pollicis abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis nb oaf are the thenar eminence clinical significanceedit injuryedit injury of median nerve at different levels causes different syndromes with varying motor and sensory deficits above the elbow common mechanism of injury a supracondylar humerus fracture motor deficit loss of pronation of forearm weakness in flexion of the hand at the wrist loss of flexion of radial half of digits and thumb loss of abduction and opposition of thumb presence of an ape hand deformity when the hand is at rest due to an hyperextension of index finger and thumb and an adducted thumb presence of benediction sign when attempting to form a fist due to loss of flexion of radial half of digits sensory deficit loss of sensation in lateral   ⁄ digits including their nail beds and the thenar area at the elbow entrapment at the level of the elbow or the proximal forearm could be due to the pronator teres syndrome within the proximal forearm anterior interosseous syndrome injury to the anterior interosseous branch in the forearm causes the anterior interosseous syndrome common mechanisms tight cast forearm bone fracture motor deficit loss of pronation of forearm loss of flexion of radial half of digits and thumb sensory deficit none at the wrist common mechanism wrist laceration motor deficit weakness in flexion of radial half of digits and thumb loss of abduction and opposition of thumb presence of an ape hand deformity when the hand is at rest may be likely due to an hyperextension of index finger and thumb and an adducted thumb nevertheless an ape hand deformity is not a requirement for a carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis presence of benediction sign when attempting to form a fist due to weakness in flexion of radial half of digits sensory deficit loss of sensation in lateral   ⁄ digits including their nail beds and the thenar area within the wrist carpal tunnel syndrome common mechanism carpal tunnel syndrome an injury by compression in the carpal tunnel without transection of the median nerve due to overuse by activities such as keyboard typing and cooking motor deficit weakness in flexion of radial half of digits and thumb weakness in abduction and opposition of thumb presence of an ape hand deformity or when attempting to form a fist the benediction sign due to compression of the median nerve as opposed to complete median nerve palsy sensory deficit numbness and tingling in lateral   ⁄ digits including their nail beds but excluding the thenar eminence which is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve  unlike in wrist laceration there is still sensation in the area of the central palm sensation is not lost because the palmar cutaneous branch runs above the flexor retinaculum and is not affected in compression in carpal tunnel syndrome additional imagesedit brachium seen anterolaterally showing nerves and vasculature antebrachium seen anteriorly showing nerves and vasculature crosssection
