irina good morning ladies and gentlemen let me kick off with some of the progress and challenges we faced in q so firstly we have been talking about the cautious optimism in both macro field as well as on the mobile marketing in kazakhstan we can now say that we are optimistic about the trends we see going to the second  from second quarter to the third quarter especially supported by the commercial activities we have already executed and what we have in front but ill come back to this main message a little bit later in a separate slideso firstly as i mentioned we have price adjustments starting to show already positive impact we had launched in june and fully coming in effect in the middle of july we also see that the cost initiatives we have taken during this year and also last year are really giving an impact and that keeps the cost level in a good controlled pacealso happy to announce that now we offer our g services in  more cities and more will be to come so we cover  of the population already with the g services with the growing trends monthonmonthlet me just touch on bb for a second here as im not coming back in the later stage on the bb side we have yearonyear growth of around  and the main contributor to this growth is our business solutions which grew yearonyear  and what we consider as a key strategic step moving forward this is part of our strategy and so far its going exactly as we have plannedlast but not least we paid out dividends in june as was announced and planned earlieron the negative side we closed the tax audit  that trond will talk a little bit later  with the total claim of kzt  billion we had already made provision last december and trond will comment on how it impacts this provisionmoving forward to the commercial side of our business the key trend shift for this year was that we are focusing our commercial activities more towards the value creation and not much on stabilizing the subscriber market share which we consider fairly stable now we came in with a slight increase on the subscribers quarteronquarter and more than  customers yearonyear we feel that its the level that is comfortable to us not to be more aggressive in the market in a way to potentially initiate another spillover in the marketread moreon the value creation side we have now announced the closure of the legacy tariff effective from  of july and we already announced earlier the price adjustments to our legacy tariffs and these legacy tariffs amount around  of our revenues and the information about the price adjustments are available in our websitealso i would like to announce our progress on the ott field we have now launched our new mobi press service which is  which give customers ability to read newspapers so in the mobile and also the mobimoney so now we can say that we have a complete portfolio of services of digital services that we feel comfortable on moving forward and develop further as the key differentiatorgoing forward as part of our digital initiatives we have now launched artificial intelligence based call center for our activ subscribers you might be surprised that has been a very big success the artificial intelligence based call center is learning the language both kazakh and russian everyday and is able to serve our customers better and better as i said this is just the first step on our wider digitalization initiatives which we will cover in our next quarterly call in more detailalso last but not least as part of our handsetsmonobrands sales activities we have launched a new line of smartphones for our  for lowend segment or lowend smartphone segment which should contribute positively to the smartphone penetration which now have reached close to  on our baseso moving forward to financials you see in quarter two improving trends compared to q and q when we again look it from the comparative basis trond will comment on that so let me just go through the highlights of the qon the service revenue side we are  behind yearonyear while data is growing on almost  yearonyear also the handset sales is now fully our own handset sales so we dont do anymore any wholesale so its going directly through our sales  own sales channels thats why you dont see much as improvement compared to last year but when we look the contract phones sold through our own sales channels then the growth is remarkable it almost doubled yearonyearebitda margin remains depressed i would say compared to last year here we will see improving trends supported by the price adjustments going on to next quarter and the second half of the yearso moving to the first half of  summary it basically reflects the same trends yearonyear we still face a decline on the service revenue we can also now feel with a reasonable confidence that we have reached an inflection point and the second half should be stronger than the first half of this yearby saying that i would like to hand over to trond for greater details on the  some of the operational kpis and also financials to walk you through the logic and thinking behind it trond  go ahead trondtrond moe kcell joint stock company  cfo and finance director thank you arti and good morning or good afternoon to everyone from my side as well lets start on slide  where we look  kind of look a bit closer on our revenue trend in q we report a growth quarteronquarter and although its still a very small decrease yearonyear overall we can see the improvement in those numbers and the trend is positiveas you can see from the chart we report an increase of  quarteronquarter in net sales while our service revenue was up  quarteronquarterat the same time if you look at the bb revenues they continue to rise and if you look at the business solutions part of that which is the noncore mobile services we report an impressing  quarteronquarter growth and  yearonyear increase our bc revenue remains broadly stable yearonyear which we consider a good result in this time and on the same level as the fourth quarter of moving then to slide  lets look a little bit closer at the trends that i have mentioned here we see the quarterly result compared to the same quarter one year earlier you can see that the trend had been positive for some time now and we are now almost at the same revenue level as one year ago data revenues are growing faster but please note that since the majority of our revenues now come from fixed monthly price bundles split between voice and data is more of an accounting allocation issue than a real trendon slide  lets look at absolute data usage and revenue our data traffic grew by  yearonyear as smartphone penetration continued increasing and reached  compared with  at the end of  the reduction in average revenue per megabyte is explained by more revenues now coming from bundle packages with high data allowancesdata revenue was up  yearonyear and accounted for  of total revenues but again please note that this is mostly allocated by accounting rules the way we do it is based on historical usage which gives us the formula allocating  of bundle revenue to data this formula may of course be revised as usage patterns change going forwardokay moving then to slide  you can see our operational performance mous increased to  in q compared to  in the previous quarter total voice traffic in q rose by  against q of  and by  versus q of  while q armus held quarteronquarter and yearonyearblended apru was up  quarteronquarter a decrease by  compared to q of  and as you can see our subscriber base grew by  versus the same quarter  year ago this increased mainly due to the promotional campaigns done in the periodon slide  then you will see the summary of our financial highlights for q and the first  months of  as i already mentioned we have a slight decrease in revenues but we do see a positive trend on the top line costs have grown during the last year but these are mainly due to volume increases and data capacity costs especially as we have a significant growth in our g network and corresponding g traffic in addition we had some positive fx effects last year which also contributed to the difference on other cost elements not directly associated with network and traffic growth we keep them well under controlon net income the difference reflects the price or the cost increases i just mentioned and also an increase in the tax audit provision following the completion of the tax audit for the period of  to  the tax authority has now presented us with a total claim of kzt  billion for this period of which kzt  billion is for unpaid taxes and kzt  billion represents fines and penalties for late payments it covers a range of different taxes one of the biggest elements are related to vat on writtenoff equipment following earlier network swaps another big element is related to withholding tax from the ipo back in  where the tax authorities claim that withholding tax should have been paid on retained earnings that were transferred into the new joint stock companythis money of course never left kazakhstan and we therefore consider this part of the claim to be unjustified and we do intend to dispute this and a number of other claims through the available mechanisms to us including court litigationwe therefore consider it unlikely that this full amount of the claim of kzt  billion will become payable following the appeal process but for prudency reasons we have made an additional provision now in q of kzt  billion this in addition to the provision we made in q last year of kzt  billionon the capex side we are now in line with our previous guiding of modest capex spend even as we continue to rollout g in an efficient manner through a network sharing arrangementmoving then to slide  we can see the kcell ebitda performance quarteronquarter and as we have already discussed our ebitda and ebitda margin decreased yearonyear the decline in absolute ebitda yearonyear was mainly due to the volume increases and the data capacity cost that i just mentionedlooking at quarteronquarter performance still we can see improvement as ebitda was  higher versus q with ebitda margin of  versus  respectivelyand with that im happy to hand it back to arti to talk a little bit more about our ongoing initiatives and expectations for the future and especially the second half of the year artiarti ots kcell joint stock company  ceo thank you very much trond so let me walk you through or give you an update also for the ones who attended our investor day so these are the projects that we run both for cost as well as for then revenue initiatives so just a short update im not going through all it in detail you can find the details on our ir website about these projects from the investor day presentationbut a few updates firstly on the convergent billing we had some issues previously most of these issues are closed and we are moving forward with the phase  of this project to migrate our prepaid customers also within a years time to the new convergent billing system and this effectively gives us a strategic advantage to start migrating the customers from the prepaid to postpaid or in kcell terms from activ brand to the higher value kcell brandon the digital transformation not too many updates at the moment so i mentioned the first green initiatives what we have done on replacing human call center with artificial intelligence based call center you will hear more updates on that program in our next quarterly callmoving forward we are in the process of restructuring our first line or field line maintenance as we speak we have number of good options and opportunities on the table and this program is going as plannedthe last two are more related with network on transmission we are actively seeking opportunities to restructure the way we buy transmission capacity from buying a capacity to basically lease or build model were also progressing as planned its too early to speak about concrete results but whenever we get the concrete offers on the table and make the necessary decisions we will come back to you immediatelyand on the network sharing like trond mentioned also the network sharing from kcell side and also from beeline side around g is going as planned we have ongoing g g pilot projects already ongoing we expect the results from the pilot projects to be ready by september over this yearso allinall initiatives are in line with our expectations and that should give us from the both cost and the revenue perspective more solid foundation for next yearlet me update you also on network as trond mentioned our modest capex budget is executed in a good way now we can already report a g coverage of  and as we have said earlier our g investments go primarily to the places where we see the higher number of g handsets available so effectively build a network where we see either potential or already demandthe capex for second quarter increased and the capextosales ratio was around  we intend to now swap our cities with beeline so the yearend target of g network will be around  to  and this is also in line with our initial plan as said earlier the g has really picked up very quickly and in the cities where we have g network like in almaty astana and some other bigger cities the g traffic already amounts close to half of the whole trafficso by that we move to guiding for the full year we remain optimistic about the second half of the year and also the guiding for the fullyear related to that will be flat service revenue and absolute ebitda compared to last year and capextosales ratio at low teens level of course excluding the nonrecurring items or strategic projects if anyso by that i would like to finish and give the word back to irina to facilitate the qa sessionirina shol thank you arti operator we are ready for questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions we have a question now from dilya ibragimova from citidilya ibragimova citigroup inc research division  vp i had two questions please first is on your archive tariffs that you mentioned you have some of them have been closed by now i just wanted to clarify whether those tariffs improved hallo kazakhstan archive tariffs and if not what your expectations regarding those whether youre discussing this with the regulator or just any update on hallo kazakhstan tariffs would be great and the second question relates to your ebitda guidance essentially flat ebitda for the fullyear implies that ebitda growth in the second half should be at least flat but the ebitda has been declining in the first half what makes your  or ebitda in the first half has been declining faster than the revenue decline because of the cost pressure youre mentioning what makes you confident in you being able to stabilize it then in the second half is there  are there any other cost initiatives youve taken or maybe you think ebitda can stabilize as soon as revenue stabilize any color would be great thank youarti ots kcell joint stock company  ceo firstly let me answer the first question regarding hallo kazakhstan and then trond will take the  take you  walk you through the thinking around the ebitda improvement to answer directly the hallo kazakhstan is not on that list what we have closed we have closed quite a bit of the regional tariffs and thats effectively in line with our digitalization initiatives and also the swap to a new billing system to just make it more simpler to our customers and also as a project to execute when it comes to hallo kazakhstan we feel confident about the price increases we have applied so the gross margin of this product is in line with our expectations or basically in line with the gross margin of other bundles so we have no reason to close this product at the very moment when customers are ready to pay a higher price for it so in that respect its not the problem itself so its  hallo kazakhstan is part of the tariffs that  where the prices were increased just recently trond the second questiontrond moe kcell joint stock company  cfo and finance director yes on the guidance i think its  youre doing the right math of course and if you compare the first half of the year with first half of last year you see that we are behind so that means that when we signal flat ebitda and flat revenue for the fullyear it means that we do expect that second half for this year will be better than second half of first year both on revenue side and on ebitda side this is mainly driven by revenue increases related to tariff adjustments we do see already effects from some of those that were announced so we feel fairly confident on that side on the cost side we dont expect the cost to increase that much anymore in second half the cost increases we saw already were mainly driven by traffic and capacity increases but also on pricing of those elements for example pricing our energy on our sites which is normally done in the first half of the year and also pricing on the internet fees that we receive and we dont expect any more that the  price increases in the second half so the short answer is that less cost increases but mainly revenue increases in the second half of the yearoperator operator instructions we have no further questions at the momentarti ots kcell joint stock company  ceo yes so i think that the holiday season is starting so i want to wish everybody a very nice vacation i hope that on the next quarterly call we can deliver some of this positive news we talked this morning and come back to the growth trackirina shol yes i think that concludes our todays presentation thank you and
