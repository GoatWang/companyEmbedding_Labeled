directors of morris motors limited were obliged to retire from the pressed steel board with the share interests of morris motors either taken over by other interests or surrendered to the company this

also noted by the commission that an internal document drawn up while negotiations between bmc and pressed steel were in progress set out the terms and assurances to be offered to customers including that the continuance of supply of bodies or tools to customers other than bmc would be subject to bmcs own requirements the commission subsequently obtained assurances that allocations will be made to
