hidden longterm value in its fioptics networkjun  about cincinnati bell cbb andrew chung telecom tech valuesummarycincinnati bell is valued as it were three years ago yet there has been a number of meaningful events that have occurred between this timea transformative fiber optics network is in progress contribution of fiber sales has more than doubled over the last few yearswe think cincinnati bell is positioned to be acquired however if not acquired it is well positioned to compete against larger peers because it holds regional scale advantageswe are currently in the midst of an infrastructure upgrade cycle which is creating uncertainty yet also an investment opportunitythere is mounting evidence that the demand for fiber will dramatically outweigh supply and we think cincinnati bell will be a primary beneficiary investment thesis cincinnati bell nysecbb is valued as it were three years ago yet there has been a number of transformative events that have occurred between this time including i the divestiture of its wireless segment ii its sale of cyrusone iii the completion of a to reverse split iv its growth in fiber internet subscribers to  of total subscribers up from  at the end of  and v a recent purchase of suntel services to pragmatically expand into michigan a transformative fiber optics network is in progress contribution of fioptics sales has more than doubled over the last few years we estimate fioptics will be greater than  of total revenue in  years the costs of deploying fiber to the home has reduced by more than a half over the past decade and this trend will continue we think cincinnati bell is positioned favorably in a horizontal market for a firm operating in a horizontal maturing market with low growth like wireline we would like to see noncore assets diversified and an opportunity to be easily acquired if not acquired we want to see the firm positioned to compete well against peers because it holds regional scale advantages we want the firm to have relatively newer fiber technologies while also having nimbleness in relative size these two factors will allow for better navigation in a dynamic landscape that calls for sdwan ip elastic cores ott offerings and more we are currently in the midst of an infrastructure upgrade cycle which is creating uncertainty yet also an investment opportunity what we do know so far is that cincinnati bell is able to grow its fioptics subscribers at over  annually versus national averages of around  we believe its success is due to its concentrated geographical footprint regional economies of scale and sga efficiencies allowing it to compete against larger cable peers we think cincinnati bell conservatively should be valued above  today cincinnati bell reported mm in strategic sales in the last  months we recategorized what we think is strategic and adjust this number down from mm to mm with the remaining deemed legacy we looked at peer multiples from various types of wireline providers and believe a x and x ebitda multiple is conservative for strategic and legacy assets respectively a look at its discounted unlevered cash flow supports our target we followed this up by modeling out how cincinnati bell should look like three years from now we think this threeyear target has a high probability to be beat more importantly three years from now its fibertolegacy asset mix will make it very difficult to be ignored we believe an inflection point exists in the coming years where its growth in fiber outweighs its declining copper assets there is mounting evidence that the demand for fiber will dramatically outweigh supply over the long term however there will be a number of catalysts in the near year term this includes the development of a g cellular network in addition to the next wave of video technology will rely on high throughput in addition to low latency part i introduction cincinnati bell offers wireline services in ohio indiana and kentucky it has a long history dating back to  when it was the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec in ohio and neighboring states this means it used to be the monopoly prior to telecom being liberalized for competition the opportunity today exists because of a disastrous merger with icx in  cincinnati bell had to borrow bn to fund the merger in addition to eliminating its dividend since then they have been repairing themselves with a number of meaningful divestitures in the recent years today they are focused on providing highspeed broadband internet access throughout the midwest they have accelerated their fiber investments over the past few years which has proven to be successful amongst its telco peers cincinnati bell is the only one consistently adding internet subscribers albeit slowly in the past few years weve only seen the beginning of their nextgeneration fioptics network two characteristics are worth mentioning first we have seen its success with capturing share versus its peers second we have seen improving cost economics in deploying fiber to the home it is likely these trends not just continue but accelerate into the near future cincinnati bells balance sheet has meaningfully transformed over the past few years this has been accomplished through the sale of noncore assets specifically their wireless segment and stake in cyrusone we think this billion and a half reduction in net debt is meaningful for a firm currently under bn in enterprise value gradually their net debt  ebitda has come down from x in  to x in  this has also positioned cincinnati bell to have a more natural equity investor base they have meaningfully delevered successfully completed a to reverse split diversified noncore assets and will be in a position to institute a dividend in the coming years the company is currently suffering through a competitive infrastructure upgrade cycle their legacy copper network is under pressure from its cable peers but this will subside we believe an inflection point exists in the coming few years where their copper dsl network stabilizes while their fiber network accelerates upwards we believe a number of catalysts will occur in the nearterm to accelerate the demand for a fiber network that presently doesnt exist this acceleration should occur before the launch of the g cellular network and driven by the next wave of video technology and applications which rely not just on high throughput but low latency despite the uncertainty around competitive environment in wireline what we do know from the past few years is that cincinnati bell can grow fiber internet subscribers  yearoveryear versus the national fiber average of around  yearoveryear we will investigate what is driving its success and where we expect cincinnati bell to be  years out part ii what is cincinnati bell for those looking for a more complete analysis we have included appendix a overview of wireline industry here we introduce the competing technologies the number of subscribers per technology and its relative market share in appendix b industry map we take a highlevel view of the industry and look at how the various parties exchange productservices with one another it is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to set the stage in i explaining why competitive advantage exist and ii to propose what we think is a pragmatic growth strategy we follow the industry map with a look at the sources of competitive advantage that exist in the wireline industry appendix c despite the escalated competitive environment it is worth noting these key sources that drive steady profitability remains intact the above table shows various wireline providers in the united states it is in no way a rigorous list but provides a quick sense of various players their relative sizes sales and margins the first observation worth noting is cincinnati bells relative size although it appears relatively small and may lack scale advantages this is not the case in actuality its concentrated presence in ohio indiana and kentucky gives it more scale economics than larger peers in the context of its own states this can be seen from its more efficient operating expenses the second observation is the relative multiples appropriately reflect maturity and growth potential of the technologies telcos predominately own copper dsl technology and are attempting to grow their fiber network cablecos predominately own coaxial cable technology with a hybrid fibercoax network ip transit providers are predominately fiber one part of any telco wireline thesis relates to the probability they can transition from their legacy copper network to a fiber network moving on we will very briefly glance over some multiples of telus a canadian telcowireless carrier although this is not an applestoapples comparison it offers what we feel is a good relative sense of the industry you will want to model out a dozen wireline peers yourself but the general characteristics of this industry can be seen using telus note you would have to adjusted accordingly given telus dominant wireless assets having built a baseline sense of the industry we will shift focus back to cincinnati bell and look at how its different from its peers we will start by looking at cincinnati bells recovery efforts over the past years over the past few years cincinnati bell has been patiently deleveraging its balance sheet from x net debt  ebitda in  down to x in  one key event was the sale of its wireless segment to verizon nysevz in  which was bleeding cash more notably was its gradual sale of cyrusone which completed in the first quarter of  to provide some context this data center business grew revenue from mm in  to mm by the end of  we think the recent changes have positioned it to have a more natural equity investor base specifically its debt pay down to reverse split in q  diversification of noncore assets for easier understanding of business segments and option to institute a dividend additionally its balance sheet has gradually improved expenses have been eliminated around its wireless segment pension obligations and maintenance from legacy copper operations we think cincinnati bell is positioned favorably in a horizontal market counter to atts nyset strategy to vertically integrate we believe the industry is and should be moving horizontally the industry is in a multidecade cycle to break apart vertically with niche verticals such as data centers ip transits content delivery networks tower operators communication platform providers security platforms and various ott offerings for a firm operating in a dynamic vertically integrated market like salesforcecom nysecrm top line growth is important the firm with more resources will more likely create that fullyintegrated solution we want our crm to be fully integrated to connect our sales department to support department we want all data centralized and marketing and analytics already tied into the same system the opposite is true for a firm operating in a horizontal maturing market with low growth like wireline in a horizontal maturing market we would like to see noncore assets diversified and an opportunity to be easily acquired if not acquired we want to see the firm positioned to compete well against peers because it holds regional scale advantages we want the firm to have relatively newer fiber technologies while also having nimbleness in relative size these two factors will help it navigate the future of sdwan ip elastic cores ott and more for those looking for a deeper dive into the industry structure we have a section titled revisiting the computer industry included in appendix e here we look at how the telecom industry has matured and why it is flattening in a horizontal structure we discuss what the requirements are in order to succeed in such a structure and cincinnati bells alignment to this we end off by proposing how we think the nearfuture will look and why we think cincinnati bell will be acquired part iii cincinnati bells business segments cincinnati bell categorizes its business segments as follows entertainment and communications ec  primarily internet and tv services it services and hardware  it services such as cloud hosting voip phones network security etc within entertainment and communication ec it is further segmented into consumer  bundled internet and tv packages offered to consumers enterprise  internet services to businesses carrier  leasing of internet pipes to wireless carriers simplistically one can think of the entertainment  communication segment as tv and internet and the it services are the additional services such as voip phones that run on that internet circuit in considering asset value it is more informative segmenting cincinnati bell in terms of its technologies dsl vs fiber as opposed to their consumer or enterprise segments in appendix g we include an introduction to digital subscriber line landscape for those who want some background we think the current wave of subscribers switching from dsl to cable is both very real and will likely accelerate in the near term however this switch in technology will take longer than expected and dsl assets will continue to have value over the next  years when the value in cincinnati bells dsl assets start to stabilize the focus shifts to its fiber assets we offer a brief introduction into the fiber landscape in appendix h we take a deeper dive into this by looking at cogent a pure play fiber provider in appendix i over the past decade the cost of bandwidth has been coming down at staggering rates this called into question the sustainability of firms like cogent thus far many have been surprised of the robustness of demand we think this trend will continue to prove the skeptics wrong in appendix j fiber supply vs demand we take a longerterm view and propose where we think supply and demand will be a decade from now here we conclude that wireless is not a substitute technology to fiber but rather connected technologies a decade from now we expect technology could have as much as a x multiplying effect on the supply however demand will vastly outpace the supply driven by content richness and the number of devices this idea is core to our thesis part iv cincinnati bells fiber build out a transformative fiber optic networks is in progress over the past few years cincinnati bell has spent around half a billion dollars in building out its fioptics fiber network this fioptics investment represents a significant amount relative to their size as a percent of their property plant  equipment it is approximately  this contrasts with centurylink nysectl which is less than  assuming a similar weighting of fiber to maintenance capital expenditures fioptics sales have been growing at a nice  annually and its contribution to total sales have more than doubled this sales figure however is misleading it is a poor representation of the longevity of its future cash flows the earnings potential of the fiber assets should increase for the next decade but will remain useful even further currently cable has taken the majority share of residential internet due to its technical superiority fiber is and will continue to offer a path back into the residential market the business case for fttp has improved dramatically over the past few years with costs falling significantly ten years ago verizons cost to deploy fttp was roughly  per home passed plus another  per home to connect cincinnati bell and centurylink have recently estimated the cost per home passed at  almost onethird of what it used to be ovum a better metric for cincinnati bells fioptics success is their subscriber count over the past few years cbb has been able to grow subscribers at around  yy versus the national fiber average about  yy  broadband subscriber growth yy looking into the near future the cost of deploying fiber will continue to come down while the addressable market will continue to expand in ohio indiana and kentucky fiber penetration rates are low relative to the national average this offers favorable opportunities for organic growth passing measures how many potential customers the fiber network exposes cbb to for example if you owned the fiber assets along a street with  homes your passing would be  cbbs passing has expanded from  thousand homes at the end of  to  thousand homes at the end of  additionally the number of fioptic internet subscribers relative to the total passing has been improving every quarter what is important to note here is absent an investment in new construction growth can come from increasing penetration in thinking about the longterm margins of fiber we can use cable as a lower bound benchmark most cable providers are around the forty percent ebitda margin at maturity this margin assumption is also consistent with the valuation built into pure fiber providers like cogent however it would be wise to exercise some caution on margin potential looking into the future specifically as the industry evolves into a more horizontal structure competition should drive margins down this is further discussed in the section on industry structure additionally cbbs primary competitor in the cable space is time warner cable nysetwx now owned by charter communications and run by a true visionary that needs no introduction finally it is worth considering how fiber deployment has played out historically how did fiber compete vs cable in  looking at net subscriber adds between  and  it is clear cable net subscriber adds beats out dsls net subscriber adds during the same quarter however when telcos added video bundled in a fiber offering it consistently beats out cable we are seeing this pattern reoccur now and probable to assume it will continue into the near future to further emphasize this does not even consider the benefits of latency that fiber offers because the use cases have not yet emerged source bek r rizzi t grewal k canadian cabletelecom  outlook for   part v growth strategy looking forward we should begin by segmenting the opportunities for growth one way is simply following how cincinnati bell segments its business consumer and enterprise we can simplify by only focusing on growth from its core business of providing internet services should cincinnati bell grow its consumer internet organically or through acquisitions should cincinnati bell grow its enterprise internet organically or through acquisitions of these four opportunities which is of priority which would be most pragmatic currently cablecos hold the majority of share in the consumer segment telcos on the other hand have good reach to enterprises because they run off the historic telephone copper network like cable in its early days fiber optics is now being pushed to the consumer segment and gaining share this should happen quite organically due to the superiority in technology the enterprise segment should at the same time become more competitive we think it would be pragmatic to organically grow the consumer segment there isnt a need to aggressively grow this through acquisitions which could further disturb the competitive environment on the other hand it is worthwhile for cincinnati bell to invest and more aggressively defend its enterprise segment breaking down the enterprise segment there is two subcomponents internet and it services eg voip network security hosting lets review our industry map the enterprise customer is looking for an internet connection unified communication network security and hosting it engages a service provider for this packaged solution the service provider acts as an integrator leasing the internet circuit from the local carrier in some cases its competitor there are two paths in investing to boost the enterprise business directly  through focusing efforts on the service provider it services indirectly  through investing in the wireline infrastructure which local service providers will in turn purchase for enterprise customers we think it would be most pragmatic to focus efforts firstly on the service provider who services the enterprises in the case of cincinnati bell this would mean focusing on building that enterprise relationship first even if they do not own any wireline infrastructure in service area this could mean having to lease the underlying wireline infrastructure from a competitor to service the endcustomer this offers a key ancillary benefit over time the fiber wireline infrastructure can be built to the endcustomer knowing they already have the relationship in place when the fiber arrives the existing cable circuit can be cancelled this is the approach cincinnati bell is taking to expand its footprint into michigan part vi risks the wireline competitive landscape has weighed heavily on dsl carriers over the past year and we believe this will continue for the next few years as dsl continues to lose share there is a compounding effect because the costs of supporting the infrastructure do not symmetrically move downwards measures such as augmenting the dsl network with fiber fibertothenode will help yet these improvements still struggle to compete with cable speeds in our next section on valuation we redefine what we believe to be true legacy assets we think it will take about three years until cbbs fioptics business surpasses legacy as a percentage of total sales as such a reasonable argument is to wait this disproportion negative emphasis on dsl legacy assets could continue the rebuttal is that with high probability the competitive landscape will subside at that time the less noticeable fiber assets will be proportionally valued the risk in turn shifts to the robustness of fiber growth categorically the concerns are either i a disagreement on a macro supplydemand for fiber assets in the future or ii cincinnati bells ability to build out their fiber network the first concern we discuss in appendix j fiber supply vs demand the second concern we briefly discuss in the following section on valuation this concern relates to whether cbb will have sufficient cash to continue its fiber build out not currently issuing a dividend to its common shareholders puts them in a good position this contrasts with names like frontier who has had to cut their dividend the immense importance of maintaining this dividend policy is difficult to describe for those interested we recommend reading in on telus nysetu quarterly conference calls as entwistle describes everything that relates to financial engineering is in servitude to their dividend growth model  their top priority regardless it is highly recommended to follow telus quarterly commentary as entwistle is likely the most articulate and formidable competitor in the telecom space in cincinnati bells case we would closely monitor its cash availability to pay down debt in addition to investing in its fiber network any sudden movement in its leverage ratio would justify a reassessment of our shortterm thesis this quandary has been weighing on firms like centurylink as they are also trying to build out their fiber network over the past few quarters their capital has been able to fulfill their dividend quite effortlessly however looking holistically it has fallen short in improving its capital structure part vii catalystentry our threeyear time frame is in line with the  target for g technology over the past few years there has been skepticism around high frequency mmwave spectrum and its application in g technology the latest bidding war for straight path nysemktstrp hopefully settles this debate in the world of g the demand for new fiber is a prerequisite for the technology to come to fruition the fiber thesis and catalyst follows the same logic of mmwave spectrum that is the catalyst are typically events that validate the demand for the spectrum or fiber asset how will fiberspectrum technology play a role if any in the future some of these catalyst in spectrum included the federal communications commission fcc publishing a notice of inquiry noi in october  in which they sought comments on several bands as potential for g the fcc confirming straight paths high frequency bands are of value by fining them for hording it verizons acquisition of xo communications spectrum atts intention to buy fibertowers spectrum and cell backhaul network technical reports from samsung otcssnlf qualcomm nasdaqqcom and other vendors validating their adoption of the technology utilizing the high frequency bands in the present environment wireline remains highly competitive with carriers offering significant improvements in speed at little to no cost one could make the argument that an optimal entry point is during these competitive environments when uncertainty is most prevalent unfortunately determining this slowdown in competition is likely unknowable what we do know is that historically the industry has been known for its tacit coordination and lack of direct price competition the likelihood that the price wars will persist for more than three years seems unlikely as the competitive landscape decelerates and cbbs fiber reach scale they have the option of instituting a dividend part viii valuation in q lumos networks was acquired by eqt infrastructure lumos had three business segments data rsb and rlec access roughly their data is strategic assets while rsb is closer to legacy dsl technology including pri long distance and analog lines rlec is something in between some valuable some not so much one approximate way to categorize and normalize its assets mix is as such above lumos data segment is renamed strategic rsb renamed legacy and rlec split between the two the blue values are inputs while the black font are calculations we start by using the acquisition price of approx mm and assume an evebitda multiple of x on legacy assets the goal is to calculate the implied ebitda and sales multiples of lumos strategic and legacy assets by assuming a x ebitda multiple on legacy it implies a x ebitda multiple on strategic assets lowering the x evebitda multiple on legacy would increase the multiple on strategic and vice versa next we will look at additional wireline peer multiples to validate our lumos analysis in addition to getting a better sense of the rest of the wireline carriers before thinking about the current multiples we will categorize the types of wireline carriers as seen above for example it is worthwhile separating wireline carriers with cable assets versus copper assets the evebitda of x for lumos legacy is lower than the average as we believe copper dsl will continue to come under heavy pressure in the next few years directionally it should come down and not up however feel free to adjust as you see fit we used peer multiples and chose a base multiple representing what we feel would be conservative for example frontier trades around x ebitda but we feel x is more reasonable these base multiples will then be applied to cincinnati bell as comparison as a sanity check we looked at recent wireline acquisitions such as centurylinks acquisition of level  x ebitda windstreams nasdaqwin acquisition of earthlink x ebitda and consolidated communications nasdaqcnsl acquisition of fairpoint x ebitda for cincinnati bell we applied our base multiples of x evebitda on strategic and x evebitda on legacy the results imply a price per share of  however there are a few other observations both strategic and legacy use a multiple we think are conservative evsales of legacy imply dsl sales may cut in half we dont think it will be that extreme but we will use this in a separate valuation model below x evsales of strategic assets is lower than our conservative base multiple of x additionally we should discuss how we are approximating strategic and legacy sales for cincinnati bell cbb currently reports approx mm of strategic revenue in the last  months what is defined strategic by wireline carriers is based on speed capabilities this definition unfortunately changes the trend is faster speeds which is why the definition changes given that a number of wireline firms recategorize strategic we dont think its fair to trust this definition we will instead define cbbs strategic assets as only fioptics unified communication and a small portion  of their dsl network these total mm which is almost half of the reported mm mm to fioptics excluding voice mm to unified communication and mm to dsl finally the ebitda margin can be approximated in a few ways we consider cbbs current margins peer margins its relative strength versus technologies like cable long term etc the below table shows historical margins what isnt shown below is the implied ebitda margin in the terminal years based on current valuations this terminal average margin for cable and fiber carriers is around  this analysis point to nice downside protection from the current price next we will look at a yr unlevered free cash flow assumptions in the above model include discount rate of   top line growth until maturity  maturity growth rate at year  and on minimal gross margin improvement this is conservative considering the cost structure of a fiber network is lower than a dsl network and meaningfully lower than managing a dsl and fiber network terminal ebitda margin of  which we think represents a meaningful amount of conservatism relative to cable peers as a quick sanity check of the discounted cash flow this valuation also arrives at the same conclusion that there is upside at the current price while applied to what we think are conservative assumptions we however feel this traditional method of valuation is not appropriate given the industry is in a consolidation phase as discussed in revising the computer industry we suspect a continued pattern of natural consolidation and inorganic growth this makes modeling based on historic growth quite unrealistic we believe cbb will either grow through acquisitions or be acquired in the longrun it therefore makes more sense to only model for the next few years over the next few years we believe fiber demand will remain strong and likely accelerate however it is cincinnati bells cash availability that will limit their fiber investment we estimate cash flow from operations to remain around mm over the next few years this assumes around mm annual restructuring and mm working capital at this level of cash generation we anticipate new fiber buildout will slow relative to the past few years legacy dsl will continue accelerate downwards while unified communication and it services will grow three year from now the thesis is essentially an assetmix swap from legacy to fiber the below model follows our above legacy definition and margin assumptions we think there is safety even using conservative assumptions such as fioptics ebitda multiple and margins remain at current levels although it continues to grow unified communication ebitda multiple and margin comes down as growth slows legacy ebitda multiple and margin continues to come down appendix a overview of wireline industry the wireline industry is broken down between cable fiber and digital subscriber line each of these offer the same service of delivering an internet connection through a physical wired medium they differ in terms of the type of physical medium underlying technology and costs economics dsl is the oldest technology it runs off telephone copper pairs and owned by the traditional telephone companies  think centurylink or att cable came after and runs over coaxial cable allowing for better downloadupload speeds  think charter or comcast fiber is the newest which brings fiber optics right to the customers premises fiber offers the potential for orders of magnitude improvement in speeds will cost less to maintain but still early in its product adoption for consumers in terms of market share cable is well in the lead and will remain so for years to come the table below summarizes the results in general cable is taking share from dsl and fiber is taking share from cable this trend will continue the industry is characterized for its oligopolistic nature in each geography there is typically two providers with large stable market share this dynamic is not a phenomenon but due to the high capital nature of the business once a company invests the capital to lay out the infrastructure there is a big disincentive to duplicate that investment in rural areas investments often need to be subsidized by tax payers in order to proceed an example is the connect america fund cafii where  telecommunications carriers will receive nearly bn in subsidizes over  years to build out broadband to  million americans after this buildout is completed the probability for a second entrant not subsidized by tax payers and with less financial strength is unlikely aside from the financial hurdles there are additional barriers such as gathering the rightsofway and risk the incumbent will lower the price after the build out is complete all in all this creates the existence of competitive advantage with return on invested capital in the midteens appendix b industry map wireline providers service two categories of customers enterprises and consumers the above diagram shows the map for the enterprise customer which is slightly more complex than the consumer diagram the enterprise diagram provides more insight on the dynamics of a typical wireline provider the above diagram breaks the wireline carrier and it services as two separate components however they both fall under one corporate entity the separation is to show the functional differences of these separate departments wireline providers have a specific division referred to as it services whose focus is on serving enterprise customers businesses often demand more than just an internet connection they need a voip phone system cloud hosting a secured network and additional network reliability it services can be thought of as an integrator of it services but not a manufacture of the underlying products as an integrator it services often needs to purchase routers from cisco phones from polycom pbx systems from broadsoft and hosting from a local data center the key ingredient used in all it services is the physical internet pipe this could be fiber cable dsl or perhaps wireless building this physical network is the core of wireline providers represented as wireline carrier in the above diagram wireline providers whose network is based on dsl technology are referred to as telcos wireline providers whose network is based on cable technology are referred to as cablecos worth noting there is fiber built into both dsl and cable networks for example dsl telcos would extend fiber optics to a street corner then rely on copper pair between the street corner to the customers home referred to as the last mile true endtoend fiber extends the fiber right to the customers home wireline providers traditionally owned the data centers but recently have been divesting these assets to focus only on their core wireline business although we have listed data center and ip transit providers in this map it by no means a holistic view it is meant to show how and where in general these partners connect to the service provider wireline carrier in the consumer segment customers generally call the wireline provider directly or alternatively order services online consumer requirements are less complex often requiring only a single internet connection the simplicity is why consumers can interact directly with the wireline provider as oppose to an it service integrator wireline providers rely on purchasing three primary ingredients fiber switches and routers switching and routing hardware vendors include names such as alcatellucent adtran juniper and cisco in general the buyerseller relationship does not favor the hardware vendor or the specialty contractors we will discuss this further in our section on competitive advantage appendix c competitive advantage there are three drivers that have and should continue to ensure the steady profitability of wireline carriers a onetomany relationship with its supplier and customers a track record of disciplined rivalry and economies of scale a good starting point in understanding how the industry works whos retaining the profits is by looking along the industry map and considering each pair of relationships the relationship between wireline carriers vs contractors wireline carriers vs hardware vendors wireline carrier vs enterprises customers wireline carriers have a onetomany relationship both as a buyer and a supplier this has structurally allowed them to capture more value as a buyer while simultaneously charging more from their customers across the united states there are many wireline carriers however there is typically only one or two that control each state local enterprises often have no choice for alternatives and must accept the price and service that is offered this effect is magnified in rural communities where on occasion service interruptions span for weeks with no recourse as improvements in speeds are offered they typically come handinhand with price hikes their relationship with contractors and hardware vendors is one of the same story regional carriers are typically not in competition with one another rather operate with high degree of coordination this is possible due to mature product offering in a homogenous industry collectively they decide when upgrade cycles occur and control this final buying decision as an example north of the border one of the main wireline providers intelligently chose to defer their fiber investment by nearly a decade the second factor driving profitability is the level of rivalry how fiercely do firms compete with one another along dimensions such as price service new product introductions promotion and advertising historically there has been little rivalry due to the oligopolistic structure of the wireline industry rather there has been high degree of tacit coordination amongst peers in regards to upgrade cycles service offerings and pricing example of such is coordination between wireless and wireline carriers include the comarketing codevelopment agreement among verizon wireless and cable giants comcast and time warner cable among others the allowance to form bundled products using each other services for better customer lockins of the variables influencing the degree of rivalry incumbents are in a very favorable position in terms of concentration herfindahlhirschman index   homogeneity very similar corporate philosophies and common goals and demand variability given product maturity the third factor driving steady profitability is regional economies of scale to a greater extend cincinnati bell benefits from this scale beyond its wireline peers it does so because it has a concentrated geographic footprint unlike some of its peers it has strategically maintained a contiguous footprint cbb is able to capitalize on this by having a dense fleet of wireline technicians and support staff that can support local customers its concentrated footprint allows it to efficiently deploy sales and marketing for example an advertisement targeting cbbs entire footprint would be meaningfully more efficient than that of a national peer additionally the economics required to justify an investment in their fioptics network is more favorable with greater customer density for example how much potential sales can be spread across the fixed costs of the planned network how much can we oversubscribe how quickly can we reach a cost breakeven all of these favors a denser network footprint appendix d wireline business model the value proposition of a wireline carriers is one of delivering simple reliable internet television and phone services in a bundled package the revenue streams are through a monthly subscription for access to the internettelevisionphone network there is typically two separate customer segments wholesale and retail wholesale caters to businesses and other service providers while retail focuses on consumers customer relationships are driven by acquisition strategies involving the bundling of internet tv and phone services the retention of customers are motivated by increasing speeds and in turn increasing the average revenue per customer arpu the primary channels to connect with customers are through local call centers and online portals on the expense side  the cost structure is driven by building out supporting and maintaining its network in addition to sales and marketing expenses it key partners are various contractors who build out the physical wireline infrastructure and network architects who build out the digital network that rides on top key activities include monitoring and maintaining the reliability of the network and scaling it up as needed finally the key resources are around its physical wireline network in conjunction to the financial resources required to fund the continued maintenance and expansion of this capitalheavy endeavor appendix e revisiting the computer industry it would be favorable in extracting profits if wirelinewireless carriers could maintain control of the full vertical stack from the data pipes to the content the past decade has proven to be challenging for the traditional vertically integrated models in telecommunications carriers have recognized the complexities in various niches of the vertical and have divested assets like data centers and towers assets niches along the vertical have emerged such as ip transit and content delivery networks overthetop offerings like netflix continue to be a topic of concern below we will look at the past present and future industry structure we will question whether the wirelinewireless industry is horizontally or verticallyintegrated we will look at the past and the present to propose what to expect in the nearfuture we will consider if the environment will be more or less favorable for wireline carriers we will also suggest that a pragmatic strategy for wireline firms is to align with the industry structure the state of the wirelinewireless industry has parallels to the computer industry the computer industry went through a shift from a vertical structure to horizontal structure in the early days it made a lot of sense to be vertically integrated computer components required a high degree of technical integration and firms like ibm offered a lot of value by integrating the complexity today the computer industry is very different most of the traditional computer companies have broken apart and have been sold off professor charles fine describes the industry structure as something that does not remain constant but rather gradually cycles between a vertical structure and a horizontal structure source fine ch clockspeed winning industry control in the age of temporary advantage revised ed perseus books  over the past few decades the telecom industry has matured and flattened this movement from a vertical to horizontal structure is consistent with modular serviceoriented software architecture which has been increasingly more relevant in the prior vertical architecture there were a number forces pushing it towards a horizontal and modular configuration these included the challenge of managing many different operating segments across the many dimensions of technology required by an integral system traditional operators had to manage data centers cell towers manage hosted applications facilitate wholesale access into their networks and more the challenge of fending off the entry of niche competitors hoping to pick off discrete industry segments niches such as content delivery networks and ip transit providers required a different distributed business model this business model was in direct contrast to traditional telcos that built their moat around regional dominance the bureaucratic and organizational rigidities that often settle upon large established companies although we believe the wireline industry and the larger telecom sector will continue to horizontally integrate it is worth considering the driving forces for vertical integration which will eventually occur these forces include technical advances in one subsystem can make that the scarce commodity in the chain giving market power to its owner at this present time we dont see such advances like this that exist market power in one subsystem encourages engineering integration with other subsystems to develop proprietary integral solutions we also see little evidence of this in traditional wireline and wireless carriers market power in one subsystem encourages bundling with other subsystems to increase control and add more value this perhaps is the most relevant factor that has some merits of truth we believe wireline providers will be able to successfully deliver tv but not control the content itself analysis of the industry structure helps to design and validate the business model if an individual wireline carrier chooses to vertically integrate is this consistent with the overall industry if not what is the method in which they plan to lower costs facilitate scheduling and planning facilitate investments in specialized assets conversely if the wireline carrier chooses to horizontally integrate there are a few key requirements for success we will see these are consistent with the wireline thesis and favorable to cincinnati bell they include  reduction in competitive intensity in a consolidated industry there is typically higher probability for high sustainable profitability oligopolistic industry structure allows the surviving firm to focus on nonprice competition ie rd spending customer service or advertising  lower costs through economies of scale similar to pharmaceutical companies wireline carriers have a shared sales marketing and support team which amount to a large fixed cost on the operations side regional economies of scale comes from the elimination of duplicate network infrastructure such as data centers cross connections and ip transit operating expenses are further minimized through having smaller network operation centers managing a larger number of network elements  access to new markets and distribution channels krafts acquisition of cadbury created access and distribution into india egypt thailand and latin america similarly larger wireline carriers looking to expand into new markets will likely need to acquire regional providers as oppose to building out their own network in the next section we will chronologically step through some key historical events in history of us telecom we believe it supports the strategy cincinnati bell is undertaking which reflects a sound management team we also think it supports the idea that cincinnati bell will eventually be purchased appendix f past present and near future  late searly s

gtt selected a niche of providing backbone services ip transit then grew horizontally within this niche wireless carriers like t mobile choose to sell off and instead leases its cell towers it chose to take on one niche in the vertical customer service and horizontally growing from there firms like digital realty focus on the data center segment  present and near future increasingly horizontal structure the near future should remain horizontal this means continued ma in horizontal lines of business diversification of noncore assets demand for modular architectures ie elastic ip core api integration dynamic routing appendix g introduction to digital subscriber line landscape the dsl network relies on traditional telephone line and is often categorized as legacy assets it repurposes the telephone copper pairs to run internet data traffic the number of customers relying on these legacy assets are shrinking at midsingle digits annually it is being cannibalized by newer technologies such as cable fiber and wireless attempting to track what a wireline categorizes as legacy is often misleading the definition of what is deemed legacy has changed several times one way to think of legacy is circuits that are incapable of speeds greater than mbps download this minimum speed threshold is what changes which is why defining it is difficult it is important to recognize that the switch between technologies dslcablefiber occurs slowly over many decades as a parallel one can look at why mainframe computers and dial up connections are still being used today it is unlikely that in the near future dsl will go away rather much of dsl services that presently exists will likely not go away cable companies have likely already explored the opportunity to expand into these regions housing traditional telephone lines but have purposely decided against it because the economics are not justified as a result many regions will be bound to dsl technologies for the foreseeable future this should be factored accordingly when modelling future dsl sales additionally there are technologies like fibertothenode which extends the lifespan of older dsl technologies it does so by mixing dsl technology with fiber technology creating a dslfiber hybrid network performance of dsl improves by an order of magnitude as a result these investments are high return on investment as youre replacing only a few centralized equipment running on better optics and algorithms while getting speed benefits across the board we touch more on this topic in the section on fiber supply vs demand finally much of the share in dsl has already been eroded from faster cable technology especially in the residential environment this is why most telcos dsl technology serves the enterprise segment while cable takes the lion share of the consumer market appendix h introduction to fiber landscape fiber optics offers much higher throughput downloadupload speed and more importantly better latency than coaxial cable cable or copper pair  the benefits in throughput are slightly more obvious but the benefits in latency will appear more obvious in the years to come applications such as virtual reality and virtual web conferencing will catalyze its relevance fiber providers have been around for a long time but not wellknown to consumers because their target customers are predominately service providers and enterprises some of the pure play fiber providers include level  communications expected to be acquired by centurylink zayo cogent and gtt these pure fiber providers offer two types of products the first is known as ip transit if an individual wanted to connect to googlecom heshe would purchase an internet connection from the local provider the local internet provider receives this request to connect to googlecom but needs internet services itself in order to reach this website the local internet provider purchases what is called ip transit to connect to the rest of the internet the second product sold by pure fiber providers are very high speed internet circuits to enterprises this is similar to regular internet connections for consumers but at higher speeds security and reliability some of the names of these businessgrade internet connections are mpls vpls epl and evpl these fiber providers compete with the local telcos and cablecos to provide fiber to enterprise customers fiber providers telcos and cablecos target enterprises in multiunit dwelling or locations where there are many potential customers this is due to the high capital requirement of the initial build out the potential return laying a single fiber to a building of a hundred residents is much higher than a fiber to a single resident the major distinction between the pure fiber providers think cogent and zayo and the telcoscablecos is their geographical focus and target customers telcoscablecos focus on a local region and target both enterprises and consumers on the other hand pure fiber providers choose to target service providers and enterprises not consumers they have strategically chosen to build a highlydistributed network spanning across states as oppose to building regional density interestingly this approach after a decade appears to have been highly successful in breaking into the wireline market appendix i fiber economics bandwidth demand vs pricing pressure for over a decade we have seen dramatic decreases in the cost of ip transit bandwidth rates have been decreasing around  annually mbps for the past five years while the prior five years have ranged from  decrease yearoveryear one might speculate that at a certain point it would be uneconomical to sell ip transit however that would be incorrect cogents ip transit business previously disclosed as their net centric segment has been able to grown at midhigh single digits for the past five years this occurred even as cogent decreased their rates approximately  annually if one were to aggregate cogents total pipe size which represents how much traffic could be pushed through their total network at any given moment this pipe has been growing at about  annually for the past  years regardless of what the future holds for pure play fiber providers like cogent one could say they have already succeeded for one they have correctly identified the business model to enter the wireline market which has a strong defendable moat see competitive advantage they hold assets which allow for a regionallyconcentrated peer to expand to have national presence driving the cost of bandwidth down is the continued improvements in algorithms optics spectrum optimization and more on the demand side we have devices like smartphones servers and pcs it is however the demand for contentrichness and number of devices that have been causing demand to outpace supply much of the longterm value of fiber rests on this equilibrium we will explore this supply and demand balance in the next section appendix j fiber supply vs demand will we have too much supply  hindering the longterm value of fiber is the supply created by wireless providers a substitute for the supply of fiber wireline will wireless replace wireline first lets look at the supply side it is important to first recognize much of the wireless network itself is fiber between the cellular towers is fiber built and managed by wireline providers wireline providers add supply by installing more fiber optic cables in conjunction with utilizing higher performing network equipment wireless providers add supply by relying on wireless network gear and spectrum supply grows linearly as more fiber is laid and cell towers are built however exponential growth comes from innovations in optics and algorithms what is magnitude of these improvements improvements in algorithm or technology are governed by the laws of physics moores law  defining the improvement in computing speed  of transistors on a chip will double every  months shannons law  defining the maximum network speed theoretical speed data can transfer given power and noise more significantly technology improvements are not realized and implemented as quickly as they are discovered there are delays in when the industry collectively decides to upgrade to the newer technology an estimate lifecycle to refresh to a newer technology is about  years cellular speeds for example require chip manufacturers policymakers regional wireless carriers and more parties to collectively work together to build and roll out the technology networks will lag behind devices because of the challenges relating to planning and implementation looking out  years from now we should see x increase in supply created by these algorithmictechnological improvements another opportunity for increasing supply is through spectrum optimization current communication devices mainly crowd around the mhzghz bands ten years from now the spectrum availability should double contributing to a x improvement in supply summarizing the supply side we should see x x or x improvement in the next  years due to improvements in such things like algorithms and spectrum on the demand side demand is primarily driven by i content richness and ii number of broadband devices there has been a constant evolution of devices phone mp player tablets laptops ipbased tv hd tv and ultra hd tv the bandwidth demand for each of these newer devices are growing at exponential rates nielsens law estimates bandwidth demand doubles to residential homes every  months the demand for content richness in combination with the number of devices approximates to a x increase in the demand over the next decade to summarize wireless is not a substitute for wireline rather connected technologies the situation in which wireless could be a substitute for wireline is if bandwidth requirements remained low  ie devices arent demanding more bandwidth ten years from now we will see an increase in the supply however supply will grow in the ball park of x rounding upwards demand side looks to increase by a x greatly outpacing the available supply the solution to the supplydemand imbalance will unlikely be a slowdown in data consumption or number of devices rather wireline and wireless providers will be working together to add more supply at the core the network will be all fiber at the edges there will be a vast array of wireless technologies such as macro cells miles micro cells m pico cells m wifi m in the near term wireline providers will hint at this supplydemand imbalance through usagebased billing in conjunction wireless providers will implement rate plans gb gb gb disclosure i amwe are long cbb i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i
