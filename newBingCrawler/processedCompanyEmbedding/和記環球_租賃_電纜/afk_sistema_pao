would like to provide an update on our progress in three key areas of sistemas strategic focus growing the value of our portfolio strengthening our financial position and further improving efficiencies at the corporate center and finally increasing returns for our shareholdersin the second quarter sistemas consolidated revenue increased  year on year driven by both new asset acquisitions and organic growth at our portfolio companies in an environment where many businesses have been scaling back operations or leaving the market  of sistemas  key assets increased revenues year on year despite elevated competitive pressure mts continued to outperform its peers with a revenue growth of  mainly due to stronger retail sales and increased data traffic consumption in russia and ukraine mobile service revenues in mtss core market of russia have been sustained year on year versus declines for our major competitors that being said the companys operating income was impacted negatively by macro factors weaker mobile service usage and costs associated with the expansion of the retail networkread morein june we successfully monetized a minority stake in mts selling  of the company for  million while mts remains our strategic asset and we intend to maintain a controlling interest in the company this transaction will contribute to further diversification of our portfolio and support our investment and deleveraging initiatives during the quarter our main growth drivers were once again our nonlisted assets with revenue growth of  yearonyear they significantly improved oibda which grew  helping sustain sistemas oibda margin of  despite the subdued market environmentthe contribution of nonpublic assets to groups total oibda now is  compared to  in the second quarter of  our childrens goods retailer detsky mir posted a  increase in revenues with  growth in likeforlike sales and twofold growth of ecommerce sales the companys oibda is up  year on year reflecting good cost discipline detsky mirs strategy to grow its market share in particular by displacing its key competitors has proved highly successful this year the company plans to open at least  new stores which should bring its total network to over  outletsour other major investment pulp and paper holding segezha increased sales across its major product lines which on top of consolidation of a new wood processing plant in siberia brought its revenue growth to  year on year as an exportdriven business with clear cost advantages segezha grew its oibda by  year on year segezha continues to add capacity and gain market share in key products by implementing an extensive rub billion capex program major investments are the modernization and construction of its pulp and paper paper sack and plywood plants as well as upgrade to logging equipmentour agricultural holding steppe is gaining scale and rapidly being transformed into a multiple contributor to group revenues and oibda with the support of assets acquired in late  and the second quarter of  in openfield crop production dairy fruit and vegetable production integration of the new businesses is going well and were seeing solid operational results across the agricultural holdings major assetsthis said steppes second quarter and six months performance still reflects strong seasonality of this business with most of the revenue to be recognized in the second half of the year within our portfolio we continue to work on the merger of sstl telecom business in india with reliance communications we expect to receive final approvals of the transaction from the rajasthan and mumbai courts in september and according to our schedule we expect also a decision by the supreme court of india regarding technical difficulty spectrum continuity to be made in october and the final decision regarding approval for the transaction by the department of telecommunications in the fourth quarter of this yearcoming to the corporate center we ended the quarter with a strong cash position of rub billion with rub billion on top of that in the form of deposits during the second half of the year we expect to receive more than rub billion in dividends and cash returns from our subsidiaries which will further strengthen our financial position and investment resources our key areas of focus remain optimization of our liabilities and leverage as well as controlling costsduring the second and third quarters of  in line with our deleveraging plan we repaid debt guaranteed by sistema at sstl we also closed an agreement with the russian government to restructure its option on sstl shares allowing us to acquire the russian federations stake in the company over the course of five years with a very comfortable payment schedule and interest rate in august we exercised an early redemption of our more expensive bondsas you can see on the slide  of our presentation our deleveraging efforts together with the depreciation of the ruble resulted in the reduction of corporate centers total financial liabilities by  year to date we plan to continue reducing our debt in  and beyondon the cost control side our performance continues according to plan in the first half of the year the corporate centers sga were flat year on year while during the second quarter costs were down by  year on yearto summarize we see that financial performance of our portfolio remains strong while our cashgenerating capabilities and monetization track record have further strengthened year on year together with the reduced leverage and with costs remaining under control this makes sistema a much more stable company which we hope will be reflected in the total shareholder returnearlier this year we approved a new dividend policy which we believe improves transparency around our shareholder returns while also creating a good basis for the growth of the dividend the policy provides that our minimum dividend per year will be the higher of rub per share or a dividend yield of  based on the weighted average price of our local shares it means that any growth in our market cap resulting both from external factors benefiting sistema or our operational and strategic progress will translate into increased dividend payouts this mechanism has already begun to work as in august our board of directors approved our first interim dividend in accordance with the new policy totaling rub billion calculated based on our weighted average share price for the first six months of the yearfinally i would like to highlight that we continue to move towards strengthening the link between our shareholder return and management compensation as you know this year we adopted a new program for senior management to participate in the share capital of sistema and group companies the implementation of the program is going according to plan as this summer our senior team invested over rub million of their personal wealth into sistema shares going forward our senior executives will continue to invest part of their total annual income into the stock thus ensuring each of us makes the best decisions aimed at adding value and improving the market capi will now hand over the call to one of our fellow coinvestors our cfo vsevolod rozanov for the financial overviewvsevolod rozanov sistema pjsfc  svp  cfo thank you mikhail and thank you all for joining us today in the second quarter sistema delivered healthy performance as we continued to make good progress in developing our portfolio assets to marketleading businesses both in terms of scale and efficiency our consolidated revenues increased by  year on year and  quarter on quarter to rub billionthe groups oibda increased by  year on year and  quarter on quarter the oibda margin was  remaining substantially flat year on year and improving by  basis points quarter on quarter i would like to reiterate that the sustainability of our oibda margins was very much driven by oibda of our nonpublic subsidiaries which more than doubled year on year reaching rub billion in the reporting quarter the growth was particularly driven by robust growth of detsky mir and segezha as well as significant reduction in the oibda loss at mts bankconsolidated sales general and administrative expenses increased by  year on year to rub billion reflecting higher sga at mts and its retail network  as its retail network continued to grow as well as the expansion of detsky mirs business and consolidation of new assetsat the corporate center level the sga expenses remained well under control contracting by  year on year to rub billioncapital expenditures at the group level in the reporting quarter decreased by  year on year largely as a result of budgets and capex decrease at mts and almost zero capex at detsky mir which invested heavily last year to develop its logistics infrastructureand on other subsidiaries i would like to highlight the capex growth of segezha which is investing to upgrade and expansion of their production capacitiesnow let me discuss our debt and liquidity positions as mikhail mentioned we are delivering well ahead of our optimization plan the groups total debt decreased by  in the reporting quarter and by  during the first six months of the year to rub billion the majority of the groups borrowing continues to be denominated in rubles with the share of ruble loans at the corporate center debt decreased by  comparing to the end of the first quarter and by  during the first six months of the year to rub billion the majority of the debt at the corporate level is public with ruble bonds and eurobonds accounting for  of that while  represented by bank loans and other borrowingsat the end of the second quarter the share of dollar debt remained  the same as in previous quarter and the reporting quarter will finalize the restructuring of the put option on sstl shares issued by sistema to the russian stakeaccording to the agreement signed with the rosimushchestvo we will acquire russian federations stake in sstl over the course of five years with payments made to the budget as per the following proportions  in   in  and  in each of   and  we have already paid  of the first installment in july and the rest will be settled by the end of this year this restructuring has significantly improved our financial position since the majority of the liability ie  was reclassified from short term to long termcorporate centers total financial liabilities including debt put option liabilities and payables to rosimushchestvo for sstl shares declined by  year to date to approximately rub billion this decline resulted from the prepayment of sstl debt the aforementioned payment to rosimushchestvo and the early redemption of our local bonds having paid the sstl debt the group canceled all the respective guarantees of the corporate center which is in line with our goals of not to provides sureties against obligations of our subsidiarieswe are now confident that we will deliver against our commitment to reduce the corporate center gross financial liabilities by at least  in  as we plan to further reduce debt and optimize other liabilitiesas of the end of the reporting quarter our liquidity levels remain comfortable as we have the cash position of rub billion excluding additional rub billion in deposits which are expected to be monetized before the end of this year together with over rub billion dividend and cash returns to be received in the third and fourth quarters this positions us well for further deleveraging increasing payouts to shareholders  and increasing sorry payouts to shareholders and pursuing additional attractive ma opportunitiesas always you can find more detailed information on our debt maturity profile the groups financial results and breakdowns by individual companies in the presentation and press release published in our websitethank you for your attention i will now hand the call back to evgeniyevgeniy chuikov sistema pjsfc  vp head of corporate communications thank you vsevolod operator were now ready to answer questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions ivan kim vtb capitalivan kim vtb capital  analyst two questions from my side firstly is there any update on potential monetization of sg trans stake and secondly do you plan to monetize your  stake in mts whatever it is maybe in small portions to go back to  shareholding and maybe  if no immediate plans you can probably talk just generally how you see your shareholding in mts evolving over time do you think that you dont require  exactly anymore you can stay a controlling shareholder with less than  stake maybe thank youevgeniy chuikov sistema pjsfc  vp head of corporate communications thank you fair question on sg trans we are in very final stages of this transaction we cannot announce that we closed yet but we are very very close and if everything goes according to plan you will be able to hear from us very soonon monetization of mts stake no decisions have been made so far and also no decisions and no particular strategy on the rest of our holding in mts were debating right now exactly what our strategy should be and i think you will hear from us more about this by the end of the yearoperator alexander vengranovich otkritiealexander vengranovich otkritie  analyst probably pretty much the same question on detsky mir can you please provide an update on what do you think regarding the ipo of the company do you think that now is the good time in the market to place shares and how do you feel about the performance of detsky mir and what sort of new plans you can share with us on the asset because its quite a sizable part of your value thank youmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo detsky mir from our perspective is performing exceptionally well if you see the growth in both revenue and especially ebitda numbers you see that its very impressive we believe that spring could be a very good option  a window for an ipo and certainly if the environment does not get much worse than it is right now i think the ipo is likely and i think if that is the case we will have an opportunity to monetize part of our holding in detsky mir with significant return so so far we are pretty happy and we are with our plan to do an ipoalexander vengranovich otkritie  analyst okay just a quick followup here as the current market conditions are pretty healthy can you please tell us like whats the reason why you think to postpone the placement from this autumn to spring because the company is in pretty good shape and even this autumn looks like really good timing for an ipo i remember previously multiple speakers mikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo the answer is very simple because in autumn were going to be selling on the basis of ebitda of  and in spring were going to be selling on the basis of planned ebitda of  which is going to be obviously higher than  ebitda therefore we hope to get higher market cap and higher returnoperator olga bystrova credit suisseolga bystrova credit suisse  analyst a couple of questions on mts bank i think youre saying in the press release and the presentation about additional recapitalization and subscription is offered to sistema group companies can you sort of suggest what would be the magnitude of the offering and which subsidiaries will be participating and also just to understand how long do you think you will be  i mean how do you see this performance of sstl how long do you expect to recapitalize it because there have been quite a few in the past couple of yearssecond question on targin the growth has declined quite bit in quarter i mean if you look at yearonyear growth in revenues the rates have declined compared to the first quarter can you talk a little bit about the strategy necessary and the outlookand finally if we look at smaller assets which i think we talk less and less about lately such as medsi binnopharm intourist maybe even utility what is your medium to longterm strategy in those assets are you planning to looking to more likely dispose them or you actually trying to come up with some more sensible strategy for growth thank youmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo your first question was on mts bank mts bank we have not yet determined the size of the recapitalization and thus we have not announced those numbers but the intention clearly is even if this recapitalization will have to take place in  it will be the last recapitalization of mts bank we are not planning to recapitalize any furthermts bank now has a decent management team a decent strategy and decent current performance mts bank right now if you exclude former provisions and issues with the mostly corporate bad loans such as inaudible and a number of others it is profitable and its retail business is developing very actively in conjunction with mts and a few of the new products that we recently launched has proven to be extremely successful especially the debit card and the credit card type to mts account which provides customers with the free mobile service on the condition of a certain amount of card usageand there are some other aspects like some of the real estate opportunities were looking at for recapitalization purposes that may reduce cash outflow but in any case its not going to be a significant amount for sistema if recapitalization is to take place in  so we believe that mts bank  the work is in the path and its actually moving on an upward trajectory right nowfor targin targin is still performing very well we expect ebitda of targin to be above  well lets say between rub billion to rub billion this year there is a slight of course decline in targins oibda due to overall situation in the oil market because obviously oil price and decline in exploration influences oil services business across the market and targin is actually one of the best performers that is suffering less from that than many others but it in no way undermines the kind of overall targins strategy and we are still very certain that this company will continue to growthe mediumterm strategy for smaller assets like binnopharm intourist and other there is no single combined strategy each asset has a strategy of its own take binnopharm its a small asset that nevertheless generates positive ebitda this year it will be above lets say between rub million and rub million it is not taking money from sistema it has now a strong management which we recently replaced we were able to attract a number of highly experienced and qualified individuals both rd and marketing area and binnopharm is now working on  actively working on development of its own product portfolio and we believe if our strategy goes as planned well be able to multiply several times fold the value of this asset so at this point it doesnt really make sense to sell because there are no adequate buyers for adequate price it doesnt take money from sistema so were developing it organicallyintourist the hotel business were looking at a number of opportunities in hotel area russia is lacking quality hotels increase in domestic tourism drives demand and we believe that there are a few opportunities on the hotel market that we can potentially pursue we have not made any acquisition decisions yet but we are looking at a number of strategies respectively so basically for every asset we have a strategy also of course we have assets like segezha agriculture targin and others which are growing quite rapidly and are relatively large and other assets are growing slower but were not looking to immediately dispose of any of themalso including medsi which yes is performing slower than expected but we still believe that there is huge potential in this asset which is yet to be realizedoperator operator instructions olga bystrova credit suisseolga bystrova credit suisse  analyst sorry i dont inaudible there are no questions can you also talk a little bit about the real estate youve mentioned a couple of numbers on revenues and maybe your potentially return from that business now and if you could maybe elaborate what happened in the second quarter and also update us on the progress on zue project and in general how should we think about it this year and maybe next yearand the same questions about  no not the same but agriculture also  i think last time you mentioned some indications on where you would expect ebitda to come are you still happy with those numbers or you can maybe update them a little bit after the second quarter thank youmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo on real estate its actually quite simple we have two assets leaderinvest and business nedvizhimost each of them we expect to generate around rub billion kind of net result to sistema and both assets have strategies both assets have opportunities to growth but right now were looking at them as sort of cash cows translating the real estate that they acquired from mgts into cash by redeveloping partially and redeveloping and renting in the part of business nedvizhimost so so far we are pretty happy with our cash investments in this area and we still  we do have an upside which were not disclosing technical difficulty projects but were kind of working on itas far as i think your second question was about as about zue is that rightolga bystrova credit suisse  analyst yes thats correct and also sort of you said its a cash cow can you hint on what kind of dividends you are receiving from the real estate at the momentmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo well thats what i said we are planning to receive around rub billion from eacholga bystrova credit suisse  analyst inaudible dividends okay thats fine multiple speakersmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo its either dividends or return of loans that weve given them but were also kind of consider those loan returns as dividend because some of those loans we intended to give them as capital injection but they were just given in the form of loans so you can call it dividendsand for zue there is not much to say we entered into this project with a partner there is still a number of additional partners who would like to invest were negotiating were planning to limit our cash exposure i think i was giving you numbers around rub billion rub billion thats probably the extent of our participation as sistema and we will see how this project shapes up when we get there so far our investment in this has been around rub millionand your third question was for agro agro we maintain around rub billion as in oibda forecast going up to around rub billion next year if everything goes according to planoperator igor goncharov bcs financial groupigor goncharov bcs financial group  analyst inaudible situation with the investment program and leverage you mentioned that you are in the process of rub billion investment program first question is how far through are you  what part of the project is already completed and what part is remaining and secondly taking into account that the leverage of this asset is visibly increasing what level of leverage you consider acceptable for this asset thank youmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo the acceptable leverage level is no more than three time ebitda and the timing for this leverage is no more than one year so basically in our plan we expect leverage going up to threepoint times ebitda and staying there at one year max and we spaced out our rub billion program in such a way that of course sort of first i think its rub billion then it is another rub billion and then its the rest and the first rub billion are clearly designed for the projects that give sort of one and a half or two years payback so very kind of quick turnaround so we start receiving cash from those investments to fuel other investments and decrease debt to ebitda ratio back to  to  maximum in two years thats kind of the planigor goncharov bcs financial group  analyst what part you already invested roughlymikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo i dont have those numbersvsevolod rozanov sistema pjsfc  svp  cfo less than twothird of this so we are still in the process of leveragingmikhail shamolin sistema pjsfc  president  ceo this year i think the amount is going to be around rub billionoperator thank you we have no further questions please continue with any further points you wish to raiseevgeniy chuikov sistema pjsfc  vp head of corporate communications thank you we will now finish this call thank you everyone for joining us today have a very good dayoperator thank you that will
