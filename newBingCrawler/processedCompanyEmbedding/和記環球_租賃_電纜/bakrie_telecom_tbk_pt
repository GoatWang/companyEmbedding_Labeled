heavily to the growing data revenues according to data from frost  sullivan a consulting firm smartphone penetration in indonesia will exceed  percent in  from only nine percent in  the firm believes that the indonesian market is in the early to middle stage of data usage increase due to the promising perspectives of the mobile phone sector in the last decade a number of companies are in fierce
