“cheers” wakefield under the name of ‘cc wakefield  company’ in  when he was  charles left a job at vacuum oil to start a new business at cheapside in london selling lubricants for trains and heavy machinery he was a persuasive man who could articulate a vision clearly and eight former colleagues followed him into the new company early in the new century wakefield took a personal interest in two sporty new motorised contraptions – the automobile and the aeroplane the company started developing lubricants especially for these new engines which needed oils that were runny enough to work from cold at startup and thick enough to keep working at very high temperatures wakefield researchers found that adding a measure of castor oil a vegetable oil made from castor beans did the trick nicely they called the new product “castrol”having helped pioneer a new kind of motor oil now cc wakefield pioneered a new method of getting customers to notice the product sponsorship the castrol name appeared on banners and flags at competitive aviation events auto races and at competitive drivers’ attempts to break the land speed record wakefield extended the company’s increasingly profitable product line to include oils developed especially for car manufacturer’s individual engines by  the name of the motor oil had all but eclipsed that of the company’s largerthanlife founder and so ‘cc wakefield company’ became simply castrol ltd meanwhile the company’s researchers delved ever deeper into the complexities of engine lubrication and a stateoftheart research facility opened in bracknell england then in  the burmah oil company bought castrol proving that castrol hadn’t become focused solely on cars and aircrafts the queen elizabeth ii the world’s largest oceangoing passenger

from curiositys wheels to its cameras the grease is formulated for the space program to perform in temperatures ranging from minus  degrees celsius to  degrees celsius the success of the company owes much to the original philosophy of charles wakefield he drew on the help and encouragement of his customers in developing his new castrol oils because he had the foresight to see that working in
