goliath formerly china advanced technology are consolidated for accounting purposes since goliath and goliath movie partners llc formed july   had no operations assets or liabilities as of the closing no audit of that entity was required under the materiality thresholds of regulation sx rule    the company is engaged in the production and distribution of motion pictures and digital content   principles of consolidation   the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated   basis of presentation   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period

financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented   accounts receivable   accounts receivable if any are carried at the expected net realizable value the allowance for doubtful accounts when determined will be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables if there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults were higher than historical experience our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated which could have a negative impact on operations   the company currently does not have any accounts receivable the above accounting policies will be adopted upon the company carrying accounts receivable   intangible assets   the company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property principally costs to produce films the company periodically reviews its longlived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value there was no amortization expense or impairment for the quarter ended january   and    films and televisions costs   the company capitalizes production costs for films produced in accordance with asc  “entertainmentfilms  other assets  film costs” accordingly production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the films delivered and recognized as revenue the company evaluates its capitalized production costs annually and limits recorded amounts by its ability to recover such costs through expected future sales   film production costs include the unamortized costs of films in progress which are being produced by the company   for films produced by the company capitalized costs include all direct production costs and production overhead   costs of producing films are amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized and participations and residuals costs are accrued in the proportion that current year’s revenue bears to management’s estimate of ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation exhibition or sale of the films ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture   film production costs are stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value the valuation of film production costs are reviewed on a titlebytitle basis when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a film is less than its unamortized cost during the three and nine months ended january   and  the company recorded no impairment charges   revenue recognition   we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  “entertainment films revenue recognition”   under asc  five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii the film is complete and has been delivered iii the license period has begun iv the price is fixed or determinable and v collection is reasonably assured the company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience considering economic and industry trends the company does not have any offbalance sheet exposure related to its customers   the company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all technical and document deliveries received waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s rights system                goliath film and media holdings notes to condensed consolidated financial statements january   and

produce a feature length motion picture known as “forgiven” per the agreement goliath will receive  of adjusted gross proceeds after its initial investment has been entirely recouped through adjusted gross proceeds additionally the company will receive two on screen credits as executive producer as well as receiving credit on all advertising publicity and packaging of the motion picture the investment of  presented in other assets on the balance sheet has not yet been repaid due to the fact that no revenues will be generated until this motion picture’s released   what is the timeline for your activities during the next  months   over the next  days to one year our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing by them of at least three projects   what is this going to cost you   we expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately  per project however licensing and distribution will be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from  –  and the costs of advertising and marketing will be handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds                why are these motion pictures not being distributed already   the motion pictures that are being produced by the company and distributed by mar vista entertainment llc take anywhere from six to nine months from completion of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements   generically the main reason why good quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money and creativity and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills many people dream of making a movie few aspire to distribute them we estimate that there are in excess of  such motion pictures “gathering dust” there also have been and continue to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many states and international territories so that many producers do not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects a secondary factor is the difficulty of finding a reputable distributor we think that our management has an excellent reputation in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution rights for content finally many distributors as well as buyers do not have an interest in niche market films because they see the market as limited goliath sees the problem to be rather there is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of films for these niches most participants in the motion picture industry are based in “hollywood” and the major coastal metropolitan areas our “faithbased” films especially are targeted toward the “bible belt” and the “flyover country” places that the industry has consistently overlooked   why are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos   after attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years our staff has developed relationships with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product goliath has also developed vital relationships with many of the major content distributors and networks many of the filmmakers have requested the company’s assistance in marketing and distributing their product goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product that is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators distributors networks and studios   so how are you different than amazon netflix blockbuster and hulu to name a few how can you compete with them they have a lot of money and name recognition why wouldn’t they jump into your niches   as a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content as an example netflix has such a high demand for programming content they are spending  billion this year for the acquisition of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them therefore as is mentioned part of their resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting inhouse” and joint venture production of quality content this content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level   there are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors goliath is moving toward becoming one of these content providers we believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand for programming is increasing almost exponentially irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumersubscriber the demand for quality content is continuing to expand as an example there are currently approximately  original scripted programs being aired in the entire television universe – a cancellation rate of  reflects a number that represents the entire programming universe in the late ’s and early ’s the upward trend is ongoing which is where we see an opportunity for goliath to provide product to reach many components of the overall market   don’t cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like tbn for faith based and bet black entertainment television for the africanamerican community   as mentioned above about netflix even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type genre and format of the content that they are showing in order to remain viable therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming is ongoing and expanding   what other niches are you looking at entering   we believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches many viewers have cable or satellite service with hundreds of channels but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests one significant type of niche we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the united states other than spanish speaking immigrants coverage is scarce the last official data  from the us census bureau is that  million persons in the us are foreign born with  from latin america  from asia and  from europe foreignborn immigrants like to watch movies from their home countries                there are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming as an example in hawaii and southern california for instance surfing is quite popular and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest   what about ancillary markets   we plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible   what films do you have now in inventory   we presently have acquired the distribution rights to the following motion pictures  seducing spirits the perfect argument marina murders film struggle divorce in america a wonderful summer the truth about layla living with cancer the biggest fan days of redemption on borrowed time tumbleweed virus x farewell buddies and the pit  under the distribution agreements goliath will receive  of the gross revenues for each of the pictures we distribute in general our distribution contracts cover both domestic and international licensing agreements however for the picture the biggest fan we obtained limited distribution rights   how do these distribution rights work   we enter into a distribution agreement for each motion picture terms may be perpetual or limited by years the motion pictures that we are acquiring with the proceeds of this offering will have a term of five years we will generally obtain a fee of  to  of gross revenues licensing will be flexible for usage applications on a yearly or multiyear basis most markets especially foreign territories have a tendency to continuously renew content licensing   how many employees do you have do you have an office   we have just  employees and we believe that is sufficient during the development production and “content aggregation” phase of our development our administrative office is in marina del rey california   do you have a website   our website is wwwgoliathfilmandmediainternationalcom we have a mirror site at wwwgoliathfilmandmediacom   critical accounting policies and estimates   the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see note   summary of significant accounting policies   the following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting the company   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation   basis of presentation   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period actual results could differ from those estimates management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud the company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure among other items that  recorded transactions are valid  all valid transactions are recorded and  transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented                use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period a change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred the more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others estimated revenue of films the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions   actual results could differ from those estimates the company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented   revenue recognition   we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  “entertainment films revenue recognition”   under asc  five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii the film is complete and has been delivered iii the license period has begun vi the price is fixed or determinable and v collection is reasonably assured the company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience considering economic and industry trends the company does not have any offbalance sheet exposure related to its customers   the company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all technical and document deliveries received waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s rights system   accounts receivable   accounts receivable if any are carried at the expected net realizable value the allowance for doubtful accounts when determined will be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables if there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults were higher than historical experience our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated which could have a negative impact on operations   the company currently does not have any accounts receivable the above accounting policies will be adopted upon the company carrying accounts receivable   intangible assets   the company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property principally motion pictures the company periodically reviews its long lived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value there was no amortization expense or impairment for the three and nine months ended january   and    income taxes   we account for income taxes under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” no  income taxes “asc ” under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled under asc  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date                stock compensation   in accordance with asc no  compensation – stock compensation “asc ” we measure the compensation costs of sharebased compensation arrangements based on the grantdate fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services sharebased compensation arrangements include stock options restricted share plans performancebased awards share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans as such compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value such compensation amounts if any are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant we apply this statement prospectively equity instruments “instruments” issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments as required by asc  asc no  equity based payments to nonemployees “asc ” defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments in general the measurement date is a when a performance commitment as defined is reached or b when the earlier of i the nonemployee performance is complete or ii the instruments are vested the measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the asc    accounting for derivative financial instruments   we evaluate financial instruments using the guidance provided by asc  and apply the provisions thereof to the accounting of items identified as derivative financial instruments not indexed to our stock   fair value of financial instruments   we follow the provisions of asc  this topic defines fair value establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   we use fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock this primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value these require management’s judgment   fair value measurements   effective beginning second quarter  the fasb asc topic  financial instruments  requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports for the company this statement applies to certain investments and longterm debt also the fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements   various inputs are considered when determining the value of the company’s investments and longterm debt the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below   ● level  – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets     ● level  – other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates credit risk etc     ● level  – significant unobservable inputs including the company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments   the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared the company had no financial assets andor liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at january   assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature   the availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction for many financial instruments pricing inputs are readily observable in the market the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants and the valuation does not require significant management discretion for other financial instruments pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment as of january   the company had no assets other than prepaid expenses and capitalized film production costs                basic and diluted earnings per share   basic earnings per share are based on the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding diluted earnings per share is based on the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments   ● warrants     ● employee stock options and     ● other equity awards which include longterm incentive awards   the fasb asc topic  earnings per share  requires the company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution   diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as there were no potentially dilutive instruments for the three and nine months ended january   and    concentrations risks and uncertainties   the company had one customer mar vista

january   that accounted for  or more of total revenue   recent accounting pronouncements   we have evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have been issued and are not yet effective for us and determined that there are no such pronouncements expected to have an impact on our future financial statements   plan of operations   although we had net income of  for the nine months ended january   we have historical losses and an accumulated deficit of  as of january   these factors create substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s management plan
