company in the northeastern and attock oil company in northwestern part of the undivided india were the only oil producing companies with minimal exploration input the major part of indian sedimentary basins was deemed to be unfit for development of oil and gas resources after independence the central government of india realized the importance of oil and gas for rapid industrial development and its strategic role in defense consequently while framing the industrial policy statement of  the development of petroleum industry in the country was considered to be of utmost necessity until  private oil companies mainly carried out exploration of hydrocarbon resources of india in assam the assam oil company was producing oil at digboi discovered in  and oil india ltd a  joint venture between government of india and burmah oil company was engaged in developing two newly discovered large fields naharkatiya and moraan in assam in west bengal the indostanvac petroleum project a joint venture between government of india and standard vacuum oil company of usa was engaged in exploration work the vast sedimentary tract in other parts of india and adjoining offshore remained largely unexplored in  government of india decided to develop the oil and natural gas resources in the various regions of the country as part of the public sector development with this objective an oil and natural gas directorate was set up towards the end of  as a subordinate office under the then ministry of natural resources and scientific research the department was constituted with a nucleus of geoscientists from the geological survey of india a delegation under the leadership of the minister of natural resources visited several european countries to study the status of oil industry in those countries and to facilitate the training of indian professionals for exploring potential oil and gas reserves experts from romania the soviet union the united states and west germany subsequently visited india and helped the government with their expertise soviet experts later drew up a detailed plan for geological and geophysical surveys and drilling operations to be carried out in the nd five year plan – in april  the government of india adopted the industrial policy resolution which placed mineral oil industry among the schedule a industries the future development of which was to be the sole and exclusive responsibility of the state soon after the formation of the oil and natural gas directorate it became apparent that it would not be possible for the directorate with its limited financial and administrative powers as subordinate office of the government to function efficiently so in august  the directorate was raised to the status of a commission with enhanced powers although it continued to be under the government in october  the commission was converted into a statutory body by an act of the indian parliament which enhanced powers of the commission further the main functions of the oil and natural gas commission subject to the provisions of the act were to plan promote organize and implement programs for development of petroleum resources and the production and sale of petroleum and petroleum products produced by it and to perform such other functions as the central government may from time to time assign to it  the act further outlined the activities and steps to be taken by ongc in fulfilling its mandate  to edit an ongc platform at bombay high in the arabian sea since its inception ongc has been instrumental in transforming the countrys limited upstream sector into a large viable playing field with its activities spread throughout india and significantly in overseas territories in the inland areas ongc not only found new resources in assam but also established new oil province in cambay basin gujarat while adding new petroliferous areas in the assamarakan fold belt and east coast basins both onshore and offshore ongc went offshore in the early s and discovered a giant oil field in the form of bombay high now known as mumbai high this discovery along with subsequent discoveries of huge oil and gas fields in western offshore changed the oil scenario of the country subsequently over  billion tonnes of hydrocarbons which were present in the country were discovered the most important contribution of ongc however is its selfreliance and development of core competence in ep activities at a globally competitive level ongc became a publicly held company in february  with  of its equity were sold to the public and eighty percent retained by the indian government at the time ongc employed  people and had reserves and surpluses worth ₹ billion in addition to its intangible assets the corporations net worth of ₹ billion was the largest of any indian company in  the then chairman keshav dev malaviya held a meeting with some geologists in the mussoorie office of the geology directorate where he accepted the need for ongc to go outside india too in order to enhance indian owned capacity for oil production the argument in support for this step by lp mathur and bs negi was that indian demand for crude would go up at a faster rate than discoveries by ongc in india malaviya followed this up by making ongc apply for exploration licences in the persian gulf iran gave ongc four blocks and malaviya visited milan and bartlseville to request eni and phillips petroleum to join as partners in the iran venture this resulted in the discovery of the rostum oilfield in the early sixties very soon after the discovery of ankleswar in gujarat this was the very first investment by the indian public sector in foreign countries and oil from rostum and raksh was brought to cochin where it was refined in a refinery built with technical assistance from phillips  to presentedit in  ongc videsh limited ovl the division of ongc concerned with its foreign assets acquired talisman energys  stake in the greater nile oil
