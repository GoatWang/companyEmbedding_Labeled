began as a film production company that was founded by dan mintz bing wu and peter xiao in the late s dmg began distribution of nonchinese films in chinese theaters including twilight and knowing film production was added to dmgs portfolio in  and its first production was the founding of a republic  dmg also contributed to the productions of looper  and iron man   and distributed the films in theaters in china dmg became involved with looper as endgame entertainments chinese partner after the companies closed the deal in january  changes to film production included casting chinese actress summer qing and setting part of the film in shanghai dmgs involvement allowed it to distribute the film in china at the same time as its international premiere where there was usually a blackout period before nonchinese films could be screened in china while chinese regulators did not grant looper official coproduction status dmgs involvement with looper as a chinese company permitted its distribution of the film variety reported that means that the film could be considered domestically chinese which can provide the same benefits as a coproduction dmg also contributed as a production partner for marvel studios iron man  though disney and dmg withdrew plans to apply for official coproduction status in china despite the withdrawal dmgs involvement resulted in inclusion of various chinese elements such as the casting of chinese actor wang xueqi and footage shot in beijing the companies also edited a different version of iron man  to be distributed in china the version included a scene with actor fan bingbing and bonus footage specifically for chinese viewers variety reported that the company benefited from strong connections with chinese government officials and the staterun film enterprise china film group the trade paper said the journeys of looper and iron man  were not exactly smooth with questions over whether they would qualify as coproductions which enjoy vital benefits in distribution immunity from blackout periods and a far greater revenue share mintz said dmgs involvement with the films has helped validate its approach to the chinese film market it was announced that valiant comics has signed a deal with dmg entertainment and dmg yinji for a historic eightfigure partnership in film and tv projects filmographyedit twilight  – theatrical
