of  the june nd  priority post announcement on isigns web site regarding e health consortium group and the installation of   smart antennas  in  hospitals in the state of victoria in australia and the rollout into the remaining  states of up to  smart antennas  going forward we have decided to raise isigns target price to  per share once all installations are completed in every one of australias hospitals and connected with isigns security device and other big data components we expect that the company’s revenues will exceed  million dollars annually from this one client  isign earns   of all revenues due to the nature of its recurring monthly fees for data management and message broadcasting against which there is little cost isign media solutions  is on the verge of major revenue streams from different industries such as shopping complexesamusement parks and airports it is our belief that isigns licensing agreement with rich multimedia technologies that call for  smart antennas to be integrated into their phone kiosks for installation in mexico and major airports throughout north americas will on its own bring about profitability to the company recently a major north american insurance company has categorized the smart antenna as a safety and security device which will open new markets for isign especially in amusement centers malls and commercial real estate projects  we believe with all these new and exciting developments  with isigns proprietary and patented technology  the stock is a very attractive speculation and could trade up to  per share before the end of   ehealth consortium group in australia update   june   according to our reseller jea technologies ehealth consortium groups intention is to start installations in hospitals located in the state of victoria  installations into hospitals located in the states of new south wales queensland northern territory western australia south australia tasmania and australian capital territory would follow later as advised by jea the state of victoria has a population of  million people and has  major government owned and operated hospitals in the melbourne metropolitan area as well as  private hospital corporations the projected number of smart antennas per hospital ranges from  to  which will be determined once site surveys at each hospital are completed  installations are expected to be in  i each public entrance installed into the entrances digital signage or the hospital way finding kiosks information systems that guide people through a physical environment and enhance their understanding and experience of the space ii the public food courts of the hospitals cafeteria areas iii the accident  emergency departments where there are long waiting times and iv public waiting areas the total number of smart antennas for the  hospitals in the state of victoria is expected to be from a minimum of  to a maximum of  for these hospitals and would increase as installations expand into the other  states  isign revenues will be derived from the sale of the smart antenna units as well as the monthly data managementmessage broadcasting fees  our technology and smart antennas are being promoted to architects who are responsible for interior design and hardware supply such as digital lcd signage way finders etc  in the  state of victoria the process is to work through level  and level  specifications and tender processes for government hospital supply and system integrations  each hospital may have different levels of procurement and capex rules needs and requirements   contract length is expected to vary per hospital and will range from  to  months with each contract to be renewable at the end of the initial period the following is the list of the

the application paperwork with the united states government to enable our smart antennas to be installed in px stores on us military bases throughout the united states and the middle east to provide

service men and women to become loyalty members and provide a greater security and convenience network on military locations isigns network push solutions along with our smart antennas recent recognition as a security device led to this invitation isign is the first corporation to receive a patent in this genre and has filed for or is getting ready to file  additional patents that could

radius of our technology while gathering valuable information from the interaction of our technology with mobile devices within range of our hardware recently one of the largest insurance companies in

developments  in late october  isign signed a licensingoriginal equipment manufacturer agreement with rich multimedia technologies “rmt” to integrate isign’s smart antenna into rmt’s teledigital store front kiosk essentially a digital signage kiosk  isign will receive a licensing fee based on built units and will also receive a data management fee once the kiosk is activated  the total fee per kiosk is  us per day  rmt is immediately constructing  kiosks for mexico airport transit system and government offices and has a rollout plan for a further  kiosks into various international airports in the us and canada by the end of calendar   based upon a  us per day per kiosk fee the revenue opportunity from this one installation is  million annually once all  kiosks are build and activated the profit margins are   percent of revenues rich multimedia technologies  is presently in five airports in the united states and is presently integrating approximately  isigns smart antenna in all their kiosks    through isigns reseller we build appps an installation of approximately  smart antennas  into crocker park a roughly  acre shopping complex in ohio consisting of retail stores restaurants residential apartment buildings and office building is close to be signed  this complex is managed by stark enterprises who manage a total of  properties  the potential is for an expansion into the other properties in time   technology overview the patented and proprietary technology does not involve apps and related downloads in order to receive and view messages and as messages are delivered by bluetooth and wifi is capable of interacting with all cell phones including  iphones and androids     our technology is housed within hardware devices built for the commercial market are waterproof and fully tested to operate within  extreme temperature ranges of ° to ° fahrenheit  our technology does not involve apps and related downloads in order to receive and view messages and as messages are delivered by bluetooth and wifi there is no cost to the recipient   our current hardware units the smart antenna was introduced in the summer of   our previous hardware was only capable of delivering messages via bluetooth which prevented this units from communicating with iphones as apple does not allow for bluetooth messaging interaction  our smart antenna which utilizes both bluetooth and wifi to communicate with mobile devices is now capable of interacting with all smartphones     our second hardware unit the smart player has currently been produced in prototype only and contains all the features of the smart antenna while adding the ability to manage content on digital screens at the same time   as our messaging requires the recipient to accept an optin message prior to receiving messages we are not considered to be ‘spam’    as we ‘push’ messages we are ‘pulling’ information into our backend reporting system that allows for realtime reporting to our clients  the ‘pulled’ information is completely anonymous in that it cannot in any way identify the individual that our technology is interacting with  some of the information gathered includes the make and model of the mobile device acceptance or rejection of messages date time and location of each interaction and time spent within range of our system  all of which is information that is considered to be ‘big data’ is of considerable interest to users of our technology as well as to data integrators   mission statement to create a national and international mobile network allowing for locationbased interactive proximity mobile marketing thus providing brands stores and third party data aggregators a  data mining machine that allows for trends and activity to be viewed and analyzed   we live in a world where our mobile devices have become extensions of ourselves  we depend on them for instant connections to entertainment social media news and deals  the phone has become our ticket loyalty card and catchall wallet  networks are faster phones are smarter and the mobile shopper is ready to spend money now    customer targeting our technology and products can be employed across multiple channels from general retail outlets to real estate  essentially our technology and products can be utilized wherever a seller wishes to interact with shoppers in proximity to their location  our initial customer targeting is convenience stores and gas stations as this is a fast growing channel that has over  locations with approximately  linked to gas stations in the us generating in excess of  billion in annual revenue  the problem faced by cstoregas stations is that  of their customers pay at the pump and don’t step foot within the store  margins at the pump are  while store margins are   the average inside sale is only   all quoted figures taken from the  nacs annual report   these problems can easily be addressed and mitigated by using our products     advantage of isign’s technology proximity marketing is a very new field  as a result comparisons of our technology and hardware to ibeacon is often made when there is really no comparison at all  ibeacons are essentially an electronic qr code that requires an application instead of a camera to  read it  the ibeacon is not a functional device without an app and infrastructure to support it while the smart antenna is totally selfcontained  while there are numerous advantages of our system the main one is in the setup requirements  the ibeacon system requires the user to pay to develop an app for each type of phone they want to address iphone ipad android each variant of the os and device type  these development costs for a retail operation can cost from  to   once an app is created a database has to be created more costs  that contains the specific offers for each ibeacon location which has to be updated any time the ibeacon is relocated  then the operation must pay to develop a management system to track each ibeacon’s location and maintenance schedule  in contrast for our system  as small graphic ad needs to be created and uploaded to our supplied content management system   for a more indepth comparison go to  httpwwwisignmediacommobileadvertisingsolutioninfographic and look for smart antenna vs ibeacon comparison  revenue streams our revenue is derived in a number of ways i licensing and oem agreement ii hardware sales iii monthly recurring data management fees including standard analytic reporting iv data and analytic sales including nonstandard analytic reporting and data insight sales to data aggregators and other third parties v advertising  and vi fees for additional services such a content creation custom integration of customer loyalty data bases and additional api or software development   the company expects that data and analytic ‘big data’ sales of our mobile data to data aggregators and other third parties will produce a substantial portion of isign’s future revenues  the company has the opportunity to gather related data from clients’ pointofsale equipment once it completes the development  of its pointofsales data acquisition pdaq software  this software will allow retailers restaurant operators etc with the ability to analyze customer transactions and associate those transactions with marketing initiatives  it allows for the ‘closing of the loop’ on consumer messaging and related purchases  this will increase the value of our data insights from the  level to a range of  to  per linked insight  once integrated into customers’ loyalty programs where customers’ permissionbased identifications are included these insights could have a commercial value range of  to  per integrated insight  an insight is the relationship of one data point with another point of data – for example the time of day that a person downloaded an advertising message is an insight the time of day and the specific day of the week is another while linking the three of these would be two insights  note that all dollar amounts are as estimated by dr j tanner of our data partner baylor universityhankamer school of business and are in us dollars     business model isign uses exclusive and nonexclusive resellers to sell our solution to business channels  resellers are now in place in the united states canada australia
