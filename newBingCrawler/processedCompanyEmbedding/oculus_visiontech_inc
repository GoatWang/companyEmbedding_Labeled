     business   overview   oculus visiontech inc is a canadianbased developmentstage technology company that designs and markets digital marking technology to business customers   we have also developed a cloudbased document protection system clouddps technology that allows us to offer a cloudbased internet service for document tamperproof protection and authentication that allow us to leverage our digital watermarking technology   historically we have used our digital watermarking technology for streaming video content distribution based on embedded digital watermarking as well as videoondemand vod systems services and sourcetodestination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through internet intranet satellite or wireless connectivity we developed a number of specific products and services based on these technologies these include mediasentinel™ and smartmarks™ a process that watermarks digital video content streamhq™ a collection of sourcetodestination media delivery services marketed to businesses encodehq ™  a service that digitizes and compresses analogsource video hardware server and encoder system applications under the brand name hurricane mediacaster™  zmail™  a service that delivers web and rich media content to targeted audiences and mediaclix™  a service that delivers content similar to zmail™ but originating from an existing web presence   we were incorporated on april   as first commercial financial group inc in the province of alberta canada in  our name was changed to micron metals canada corp which purchased  of the outstanding shares of usa video inc a texas corporation in order to focus on the digital media business in  we changed our name to usa video interactive corp and continued out of the province of alberta into the state of wyoming at a shareholders meeting held on december   a resolution was passed to change our name to oculus visiontech inc and to alter our share capital by way of a reverse stock split share consolidation on the basis of fifteen old common shares for one new common share on january   we changed our name to oculus visiontech inc and completed the reverse stock split we have one whollyowned subsidiary usvo inc a corporation organized under the laws of the state of connecticut   our executive and corporate offices are located at suite   west hastings street vancouver british columbia canada vc n our telephone number is  and our facsimile number is  our email address is contactoculusvisiontechcom and our website is wwwoculusvisiontechcom  our common shares are listed for trading on the tsx venture exchange tsxv – ovt otcqb – ovtz fse – usf    h ighlights   february   – completed alpha testing of our cloudbased document protection system “cloud dps” and commenced field trials   february    commenced development of photo dps product utilizing our proprietary dps technology including invisible watermark algorithm   february   – the company’s shares commenced trading on the frankfurt stock exchange under the trading symbol “usfi” security code ‘aijtah’   october   – completed field testing and related software stress tests on our proprietary cloud dps   november   – we made available our cloud dps  product for purchase and trial at our company’s website wwwoculusvisiontechcom  utilizing amazon web services “aws” cloud infrastructure        november   – we developed a document viewer which allows for the tracking of documents from transmission by the sender to receipt and review by the recipient   december   – we released dps  beta with upgrades featuring a seamless streaming process for data transfer and incorporation of our document viewer   business environment and market opportunity   we have recognized that internetbased digital document securityprotection products are a business opportunity for the company that allow us to apply our proprietary realtime digital video watermarking technology which was developed for studios and networks in the entertainment industry to the digital document securityprotection sector our cloud dps technology introduces the company to the online digital document securityprotection industry and possible vertical markets that exist in the sector including the ability to confirm the authenticity of online documents and photographs distributed through traditional wireline networks or over wireless smart devices     our clouddps secures and protects digital documents including text documents photos blueprints etc from any modification andor attempted forgery it works by imperceptibly watermarking documents using realtime image processing and watermarking algorithms embedded into a securedprotected copy of a document this protected copy is designed to resist any attempts to alter or forge the document by forensically tracking and deterring any attempts to tamper with the document the watermarking algorithms are able to ascertain whether a document is protected by our dps technology and if any attempts to modify or tamper with the document occurred any such modifications will be flagged time stamped and can be spatially highlighted in the document where any tampering occurred this authentication and verification process ensures the integrity of the original document   strategic plan   our strategic plan is to use our proprietary digital watermarking technology to offer a cloudbased internet service for document tamperproof protection and authentication we expect to continue our focus on developing our clouddps technology and overtime to switch our focus away from videoondemand vod systems and the associated products and services   we believe that our clouddps technology is superior to the products offered by our competitors which do not rely on a file invariant watermarking system as opposed to a system that supports different file formats such as microsoft office open office etc by employing handlers for each document file format in order for a nonfile invariant system to be used successfully for a variety of documents it must be capable of handling and working with all present and future file formats whereas our dps solution relies on the pdf portable document format document format to create a format invariant watermarking system pdf document readers are freely available and widely popular all the incoming documents can be converted into pdf images and protected with an image understanding algorithm while the pdf document layout is preserved   going forward we plan to licence our cloudbased document protection services clouddps to select document distributors and allow these distributors to expand their cloudbased service offerings for endcustomers we expect to differentiate the clouddps from our competitors on the basis of its core tamperproof technology and by providing a superior process workflow and mobile user experience for document protection processing and management for business to business bb and business to consumer bc customers we also plan to develop our cloud services and workflows to enable the mass market mobile users access these technologies while processing storing and sharing their sensitive documents   proprietary technologies   our previous videoondemand vod systems sourcetodestination digital media delivery solution were based on our proprietary rich media delivery infrastructure and software and our store and forward videoondemand patent this patent expired in february of  subsequently we have elected not a patent our clouddps technology      our proprietary document protection technologies include digital watermarking based document tamperproofing for all types of documents the objective is providing document originators and users the confidence that a subject document is authentic and has not been forged   our main technology differentiator is contentbased document protection which involves searches for robust invariant documentimage segments this proprietary document recognition technology is a file format invariant watermarking system and is subsequently fundamentally different from todays document data encrypted schemes stored in different file formatscontainers the key feature of our dps technology are     ● our dps technology personalizes protected documents based on their content thereby creating a format invariant watermarking system a document converted into a pdf document is encrypted before delivery such that it cannot be opened without providing proper credentials the result is that a document watermarking system can be offered as a cloudbased software service that can     o protect  accept any incoming document through a web portal watermark it and return the watermarked document as a pdf document   o authenticate  the document authenticator is also a cloudbased software service that can accept the watermarked document and validate the authenticity of the documents   ● our dps technology combines the access control security for electronic documents forensic grade antitampering technology based on the documents content understanding and data storage optional into a single unique solution because of its cloudbased scalable system architecture the dps has a potential to expand and grow into a complete document management security and storage ecosystem offered in a flexible and costeffective web service model   products and services   currently our principal product is our proprietary digital watermarking document protection technology   our cloudbased web service system architecture enhances already existing storage and collaboration solutions such as google drive dropbox boxcom and others by adding document tamperproof protection and workflows such as document signoffs authentication secure distribution and collaboration we believe that this will allow our dps technology to be deployed and scaled in wide range of vertical markets such as     ● corporate contracts and agreements management   ● corporate core development documents   o ip protection   o real estate contracts management   o governmentrelated document management and security health care law enforcement   ● specification document protection for industrial users in the automotive aerospace engineering companies   another product under development is a standalone costeffective documentphoto security solution for the personal document management field bc segment   we have been developing a number of specific products and services based on our dps technology these include     ● legal dps  a textbased dps webservice to protect legalcontract documents for business partners   ● cyber dps  a standalone generic dps product fully accessible by a desktopwebmobile app smart devices and intended for retailsmalloffice customers and individual users   ● photo dps  an online photo protection system intended for social media industry and for hybrid documents – mixed text still images including medical images graphs blue prints etc   ● hybrid dps  a protectionsecurity system for documents with textual graphical and photo still images inputs  segments making a document page   ● ms cyber dps  a nextgeneration   standalone dps offering a user friendly endtoend cloudbased dps with a competitive document management system dms for small businesses and individuals on top of document protectionsecurity service   ● p biometrics  a photo protection system for social media industry that is intended to include fast online image understanding features selection and extraction for facialpattern recognitiondetection capabilities this product may require a codevelopment effort with global network providers        we also plan to launch our own cloud with the following features     ● secure server cluster   ● digital vault for storing protected documents   ● online document availability and delivery   ● offsite backup using a secure archival service   ● redundancy maintained by the failover servers     customers and markets   on january   we received notice that our sole software license agreement dated november   for customized deployment of our proprietary watermarking technology to one of the industrys major hollywood studios was to be terminated effective january     we currently have no customers for our products and services we are taking steps to monetize our clouddps technology these steps include actively seeking licensing initiatives our dps architecture is designed as a web service which allows for an easy customization to individual customer needs the main customization effort is reduced by our creation of well synchronized interfaces to a potential customers infrastructure this feature will allow us to offer white label licensing of our dps technology   the principal market for our products services are businesses requiring digital documents protection authentication and storage for example digital watermarking technology may be required by copyrightowning content providers who have concerns about the authenticity and forgery protection of their documents potential business users and areas of our products include     ● legal contracts  – we plan to offer a secured contract protection services to online legal content distributors and directly to legal firms from our data center this will require us to launch our legal dps differently disruptively and globally for the mass market rather than joining the list of local vendors in this segment     ● real estate contracts  – a special case of the above service real estate is a large and unique market where we can provide streamlined efficient contract signing and sharing service among buyers sellers agents and lawyers related to a deal we believe that many of the cumbersome manually signed contracts today could become paperless and be signed off from mobile real estate title registration in the united stated by first american title fidelity national financial and alike are potential customers because the tamperproofing protection of their title documents is crucial and including millions of documents a year   ● healthcare records management system  – this vertical market requires secure sharing of patient data among healthcare service providers the patients and the healthcare insurers we expect to develop bb projects with selected healthcare providers that require secure and standard complying health records management   ● government documents management  – we expect this vertical to be similar to the healthcare vertical applications in serving citizens businesses and vendors   ● engineering specs protection  – manufacturing and engineering companies are required to store manage and share their secured files with vendors and developers we intend to offer secured cloud storage for tamperproof documents   ● financial institutions have a great deal of account related files agreements and transaction records that may require tamperproof protection we intend to pursue large opportunities in this vertical market and be open to licensing servers in these institutions data centers   ● high security organizations  – similarly to financial institutions these organizations would require our dps installed in their data centers this complicates the update and maintenance of these servers and hence makes this difficult market even less attractive for us we will monitor opportunities in this vertical market        materials and supplies   we are in the process of migrating from a serverbased environment into a cloud webbased environment eventually we expect to host a digital cloud in our own data center we plan to assemble our cloud server hardware from components manufactured by others we will specify procure assemble test and deploy the various system components servers routers solidstate memory blocks according a set of procedures that we will develop for this we have started preliminary consultations with companies that supply the major components and materials needed to build and expand our cloud systems cloud components can be programmed and configured to meet a wide variety of different vertical markets requirements we will procure the materials and hardware to assemble our cloud from various companies as needed and in sufficient quantities to preclude any danger of significant sourcing problems in the immediate future there are no seasonal limitations on our operations   we plan to launch the ovt cloud with main set of features as follows     ● secure server cluster   ● digital vault for storing protected documents   ● online document availability and delivery   ● offsite backup using a secure archival service   ● redundancy maintained by the failover servers   competition   to successfully launch our products and services and derive revenues from our technology we face competition from a number of competitors with more established products and services in our sector potential competitors include    digisign  which markets cloudbased application programming to document creating companies offering them digital signatures their business model is similar to ours while a potential competitor we are contemplating offering a product that complements digisigns technology otherwise we will have to provide our own document signing and protecting workflows and solutions the principal differences between the digisign solution and our solution are that we offer i document tamperproof protection for highvalue documents ii simple and fast mobile user experience iii bc consumer collaborative repository of contracts signed and sealed in the cloud    altavionnexstamp  a california based developer of document and human authentication technologies the company developed digital stamping technology for document authentication filling a void in the standard digital signature technology area this technology alleviates the burden of proof of forgeries made to documents the company grows through franchises in various countries    markany from south korea released in  epage safer™ the worlds first solution designed to prevent document forgery the solution has improved public administration services and helped move the age of egovernment forward in korea markany also developed content safer a digital rights management platform that has contributed to the development of koreas content industry by creating a secure environment for the distribution of content through the protection of multimedia content copyrights markany develops a technology for d parts protection from copying    contractworkscom is the newest member of the securedocs inc from california contractworks provides contract management software services from the cloud that focuses on usability and a simple user interface they provide secure storage and visible watermarking feature to protect documents their pricing is  a month for unlimited secure storage of contracts        most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories in the document protection industry larger customer bases greater name recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than us in addition larger wellestablished and wellfinanced entities may acquire invest in or form joint ventures with online competitors as the use of the internetcentric cloudbased cyber document security services increases in addition cyber document security and cloud document management technologies and the expansion of existing bb and bc document protection technologies are expected to result in additional competition   research and development   our current research and development is focused on the evolution of our digital watermark technology we redirected our wavelet development and other image processing methods toward the creation of an adaptive contentdependent document protection technology that is grounded in similar science as wavelet compression products currently in development include     ● photo dps  an online photo protection system intended for social media industry and for hybrid documents – mixed text still images including medical images graphs blue prints etc   ● hybrid dps  a protectionsecurity system for documents with textual graphical and photo still images inputs  segments making a document page     ● dm cyber dps  a nextgeneration   standalone dps offering a user friendly endtoend cloudbased dps with a competitive document management system dms for small businesses and individuals on top of document protectionsecurity service   our shorttomidterm rd plans include     ● android app in order to use dps as a standalone product it needs to have a front end interface for wider acceptance the frontend application needs to be implemented on smartphone devices in this release an app will be created for android platform which will be available in the google play store   ● photo protection this release will enhance dps in a major way by implementing new watermarking algorithm capable of protecting photos with this functionality dps can start to address wider market such as healthcare social media etc   ● document dispatch agent with the document dispatch framework more document dispatch agents can be created that are capable of routing the protected documents to various destinations such as    o dropbox    o google drive   ● oculus protectedprint we plan to create a standalone product that allows user to protect the documents from their own favourite apps by simply printing the document to oculus virtual printer this product will only be available on microsoft windows desktop platforms   ● ios iphone app we plan to address dps front end capability as well by supporting the ios platform and by creating iphone app dps will then be capable of running the frontend apps on windows desktop android and ios platform allowing us to cover all of the major platforms available   during fiscal   and  our research and development expenditures were  and  respectively   intellectual property   our success is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely upon patents trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology products and services   on june   united states patent application no   method and apparatus for digitally fingerprinting videos  was officially filed with the us patent and trademark office this patent is for  mediasentinel ™  this patent expired in february of  at this time we have elected not to patent our clouddps technology        laws and regulations   our operations are or may be subject to various federal provincial state and local laws regulations and recommendations relating to the marketing of products and relationships with data protection intellectual property protection the export of technology products to certain countries and privacy protection although we believe that we are compliance with all federal provincial state and local regulations the risk of claims and actions against us for breach of the aforesaid laws cannot be eliminated completely in the event of a breach of these laws we could be held liable for any damages that result the amount of such damages could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition   employees   we currently have no employees we engage independent contractors to provide services as necessary compensation for current and future work will be conducted on a contract basis     the loss of the services of any key management could have a materially adverse effect on the company we do not maintain key man life insurance on the life of its officers in addition our future success will depend in part upon its continuing ability to hire train motivate and retain key senior management and skilled technical and marketing personnel competition for technical personnel in the industry we compete in is intense our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to contract assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we have had limited success in recruiting qualified contractors but there is no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future attracting qualified expertise is contingent on raising sufficient working capital and project advancement   oculus website   our website address is wwwoculusvisiontechcom  information found on

however the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we may currently deem immaterial may become important factors that harm our business financial condition or operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or operations could suffer   our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects   we have a very limited operating history in the context of document protection products and services and have yet to develop an extensive record regarding the sale of our products and services as a result our ability to accur ately forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties including our ability to     • maintain or develop relationships with suppliers and marketing partners          • establish a customer base     • continue to develop a nd upgrade our technology products and services     • provide superior customer service     • respond to competitive developments and     • retain and motivate qualified personnel     • in addition we have and will continue to be subject to the risks and unc ertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to market factors or if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business could suffer   we have incurred substantial losses we expect to incur losses in the future and may never achieve profitability   to date we have not generated a profit or significant revenue from operations and in fact have incurred substantial loss es for the year ended december   we maintained   of negative working capital but sustained a net loss of   and had an accumulated deficit of      we intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources o n the development of our proposed products and services and other aspects of our business as a result we expect operating losses and negative cash flows to increase for the foreseeable future consequently we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability we may be unable to do so if our revenues grow more slowly than anticipated or if operating expenses increase more than expected or are not reduced sufficiently we may never achieve profitability because of factors discussed in this paragraph our auditors in their report on our financial statements have expressed substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a going concern     if we are unable to obtain substantial additional financing we may not be a ble to remain in business   we require substantial working capital to fund our business we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since the inception of our current business and expect to continue to do so for the for eseeable future our capital requirements will depend on several factors including our ability to establish and expand a client base to grow our sales and to employ effective marketing efforts our capital needs will also be influenced by the rate of market acceptance of our products and services   we expect that we will require approximately  to  in financing to meet our working capital needs for the remainder of   and further financing thereafter if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned we may require additional financing we have no arrangements or commitments for any financing financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to further develop or enhance our products and services take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or ultimately to remain in business        our operating results in futu re periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations which would likely affect the trading price of our common shares   our quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of facto rs many of which are outside of our control some of these factors include     • our ability to attract and retain customers     • the introduction of new enhancements in digital watermarking     • price competition     • our ability to remain competitive in o ur product and service offerings     • our ability to attract new personnel and     • us and foreign regulations relating to the internet   as a result of the factors listed above and others periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in predicting our future performance it is possible that our operating results will not meet market expectations in some future quarter or quarters which would likely result in a significant decline in our stock price   the document prote ction market is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully would limit our ability to retain and increase our market share   the cyber document security and its superset cyber data security are new rapidly evolving and extremely compe titive sectors and we expect that competition will intensify in the future we compete with other companies that provide all or certain aspects of our services including other cyberdocument protection systems based on document digital watermarking and others and expect that additional competition in the future will be provided by those types of providers our current market share is insignificant   the document protection market is currently dominated by a small number of larger companies including di gisign altavionnexstamp markany and contractworkscom most of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases stronger brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than us in addition larger wellestablished and wellfinanced entities may acquire invest in or form joint ventures with online competitors as the use of the internetcentric cloudbased cyber document security services increases in addition cyber document security and cloud document management technologies and the expansion of existing bb and bc document protection technologies are expected to result in additional competition        we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the inability to do so could decrease our revenues prevent us from achieving profitability and adversely affect our ability to establish maintain and increase our market share   the video digital watermarking business is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully would limit our ability to retain and increase our market share   the video digital watermarking market is rapidly evolving and extremely competitive we expect competition to intensify in the future we compete with companies tha t provide all or certain aspects of our services including other mediastreaming providers content encoders video production companies and internet datamanagement companies our current market share is insignificant   the video digital watermarking m arket is currently dominated by a small number of larger companies including civolution and verimatrix most of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases stronger brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than us in addition larger wellestablished and wellfinanced entities may acquire invest in or form joint ventures with online competitors as the use of the internet and other online services increases in addition new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies are expected to result in additional competition   we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the inability to do so could decrease our revenues prevent us from a chieving profitability and adversely affect our ability to establish maintain and increase our market share   we are subject to rapid technological change which could render our products and services obsolete   our future success will depend in part o n our ability to offer products and services that incorporate leading technology and address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers our market is characterized by rapidly changing and unproven technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition and frequent new service introductions these changes and developments may render our products and technologies obsolete in the future as a result our success depends on our ability to adapt to these changes particularly to develop new products and services adapt our current products and services or to acquire new products and services that can compete successfully there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts        in addition future advances in technology may not be beneficial to or compatible with our business and we may not be able to incorporate technological advances into our products and services in a costeffective and timely manner keeping pace w ith technological advances may require substantial expenditures and lead time particularly with respect to acquiring updated hardware and infrastructure components for our systems we may require additional financing to fund such purchases any such financing may not be available on commercially reasonably terms if at all when needed and may result in a loss of earnings and market share   we are dependent upon vendors and other third party service providers and will be competing with some of these comp anies   we are and will continue to be dependent on vendors and other providers to supply the hardware software and colocation resources that comprise our products and services we have no longterm or exclusive contracts or arrangements with any of t hese vendors or providers we cannot be certain that our current and proposed vendors and service providers will continue to do business with us or that we will be able to establish relationships with new vendors and service providers if necessary if we are unable to establish and maintain satisfactory relationships and arrangements with these third parties our business could be harmed in addition we will be dependent upon our third party vendors and other suppliers to adequately test their products before release and to provide support for their products after delivery failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business   further we currently compete with and expect to compete with in the future providers of some of our technolog y or system components if we are unable to effectively balance our need to cooperate and compete with these companies our business may be harmed   our services are complex and we may not be able to prevent defects that could decrease their market accept ance result in product liability or harm our reputation   our document security digital water marketing and streaming media products and services are complex and the steps we take to ensure that they are free of errors or defects particularly when fi rst introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released may not be successful we cannot guarantee that current versions or enhanced versions or our products will be free of significant software defects or bugs despite our testing and testing by our thirdparty vendors and providers current or future products may contain serious defects serious defects or errors could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance of our products and could seriously harm our business and operating results errors in our products may be caused by defects in thirdparty hardware or software incorporated into our products if so we may be unable to fix these defects without the cooperation of these thirdparty providers because these defects may not be as significant to these providers as they are to us we may not receive the rapid cooperation that we may require errors defects or other performance problems with our products could also harm our customers businesses or result in potential product liability claims even if unsuccessful a product liability claim brought against us would likely be timeconsuming costly and harmful to our reputation nor can there be any assurance that our product liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any successful claim        any loss of our personnel or inability to acquire new personnel could harm our business   our continued operations and future success relies significantly on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team could cause significant disruption in our business we have no longterm employment agreements with senior management do not currently maintain any  key person  life insurance and have no employees as such our future success depends on our ability to retain current senior management and to identify attract hire train retain and motivate other highly skilled technical managerial operations customer service and sales and marketing personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may not successfully attract assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel the failure to retain and attract the necessary personnel could impede our future success   failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting   effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud ours operating results could be harmed failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment regardless of whether the company is required to maintain such controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on the companys share price although the we are not aware of anything that would impact its ability to maintain effective internal controls we have not obtained an independent audit of the companys internal controls and as a result we are not aware of any deficiencies which would result from such an audit further at such time as the company is required to comply with the internal controls requirements of the sarbanesoxley act we may incur significant expenses in having its internal controls audited and in implementing any changes which are required        we do not currently have any paying customers   our sales were   in  and   in  one customer accounted for  of our revenue for the year ended december   the contract with this customer expired at the end of january  and was not renewed we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future the inability to increase the number of customers could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or could cause revenue to drop quickly and unexpectedly   our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property   we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patents trade s ecrets trademark laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees and third parties despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we have proprietary rights over litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources with no assurance of success and could seriously harm our business and operating results   our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others causing us to incur significant costs or prevent us from licensing our products   other companies including our competitors may have or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or license our products we cannot be certai n that our products do not and will not infringe patents or the proprietary rights of others we may be subject to legal proceedings including claims of alleged infringement by others of the intellectual property rights of third parties if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to or are unable to license the infringed technology on commercially reasonable terms our business and operating results could be significantly harmed companies in the technology sector are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights particularly patent rights although we are not currently subject to any litigation or claims any future claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following     • cease selling incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property     • o btain a license from the rightsholder or owner of the infringed intellectual property which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or     • redesign our products or services        if we are forced to take any of these action s our business could be substantially harmed   our success depends on the continued growth in demand for ebusiness applications   our primary business strategy involves the development of products and services that enable users to transmit video over the internet as a result our future sales and any future profits will be substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of business by consumers and businesses to be successful consumers and businesses that have historically used traditional means of commerce to transact business must continue to accept and utilize the internet as a medium for conducting business and exchanging information consumers and businesses may reject the internet as a viable commercial medium for a number of reasons including potentially inadequate network infrastructure slow development of enabling technologies insufficient commercial support and privacy concerns in addition delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity or increased government regulation could cause the internet to lose its viability as a commercial medium if the demand for ebusiness applications does not grow or grows more slowly than expected demand for our products and services would be reduced and our revenue would suffer   government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs and risks to doing business on the internet   we are not currently subj ect to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than regulations applicable to businesses generally export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce however due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet covering issues such as user privacy pricing content copyrights distribution and characteristics and quality of products and services   furthe rmore the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business   the applicability of existing laws to the internet property ownership cop yrights encryption and other intellectual property issues taxation libel export or import matters obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain the vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies as a result they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies changes to such laws intended to address these issues including some recently proposed changes could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace such uncertainty could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs        our share price has been and could be highly volatile which could result in substantial losses to investors   the trading price of our common shares has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors including variations in quarterly operating results new products or services offered by us or our competitors conditions or trends in the internet and online commerce industries changes in the economic performance andor market valuations of other internet and online service companies and other events or factors many of which are beyond our control in addition the stock market in general and the market for internetrelated and technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations including large price drops in       and  that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities classaction litigation has often been instituted against affected companies such litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources   we have not paid cash dividends in the past and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future any return on investment may be limited to the value of the companys common shares   we have never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its capital stock in the foreseeable future the payment of dividends on the companys capital stock will depend on its earnings financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting the company at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant if we do not pay dividends its common shares may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the common shares price appreciates        securities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the companys common shares and this may have a negative impact on its market price   the trading market for the companys securities could depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about oculus business and the company we do not have any control over these analysts there is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover the companys securities if securities analysts do not cover the company the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market prices of the companys common shares if the company is covered by securities analysts and its securities are the subject of an unfavorable report the prices for the companys securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to publish regular reports on the company the company could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause its share price andor trading volume to decline   antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change in control of the company   our articles of continuance and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions that could discourage delay or even prevent an acquisition of our company at a premium price or at all any of these provisions might prevent the market price of our common shares from increasing in response to takeover attempts and could prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the common shares   we intend to issue additional equity securities which may dilute the interests of current shareholders or carry rights or preferences senior to the common s hares   we intend to issue additional equity securities in order to raise working capital accordingly existing shareholders may experience additional dilution of their percentage ownership interest in our company in addition the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing common shares   the exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of common shares or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares will dilute the ownership interests of the companys current shareholders and may adversely affect the future market price of the companys common shares   we may use stock options stock grants and other equitybased incentives to provide motivation and compensation to our offi cers employees and key independent consultants the award of any such incentives will result in an immediate and potentially substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could result in a decline in the value of the companys share price the exercise of these options and the sale of the underlying common shares and the sale of common shares issued pursuant to stock grants may have an adverse effect upon the price of the companys common shares        limited liability of executive officers and direct ors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against them   our bylaws contain provisions that limit the liability of directors for monetary damages and provide for indemnification of officers and directors these provisions may discourage sha reholders from bringing a lawsuit against officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duty and may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors even though such action if successful might otherwise have benefited the shareholders in addition a shareholders investment in oculus may be adversely affected to the extent that costs of settlement and damage awards against officers or directors are paid by oculus pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the bylaws   requirements of the sec with regard to lowpriced penny stocks may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market   penny stocks are lowpriced and usually highly speculative stock selling at l ess than  per share our securities are subject to rule g under the exchange act which imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally an individual with a net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  together with his or her spouse for transactions covered by this rule a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale the rule also requires the delivery prior to the transaction of a risk disclosure document mandated by the sec relating to the penny stock market the brokerdealer must also disclose the commissions payable for the transaction current quotations for the stock and if applicable the fact that it is the sole market maker in the stock consequently the rule may adversely affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market   we do not anticipate paying dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future   we have not paid dividends on our common sh ares and we intend for the foreseeable future to invest any earnings in the further development of our business accordingly shareholders should not expect to receive any dividends on their shares        we may be exposed to adverse currency exchange rate f luctuations which could harm our financial results and cash flows   substantially all of our assets and operations are located and conducted in the united states and canada as a result our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency rates relate to canadian dollar operating expenses assets and liabilities a decline in the canadian dollar would decrease the us dollar value of our canadian assets while a rise in the canadian dollar would increase the us dollar value of canadian operating expenses and liabilities   international transactions are settled in us dollars as a result weaknesses in foreign currencies could adversely affect demand for our products   service outages and disruption of our infrastructure may harm our adversely impac t business operations and injure reputation   we may experience outages or disruptions to our services or infrastructure before during or after the transition to a cloud platform including information technology system failures and network disruptions such events could interrupt our customers access to our services adversely affect their perception of our services reliability and consequently reduce our revenue   security vulnerabilities in our products and services or any breach of our security me asures may injure our reputation and disrupt our business   we intend to host a digital cloud platform with various features including document storage while this cloud service will have security features cloudbased content has been and continues to b e targeted by malicious cyberattacks should our security features be breached as a result of thirdparty attacks or due any error negligence product defect or otherwise and should such a breach compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our cloud services the business may suffer and its reputation may be injured in addition if an actual or perceived security breach occurs we may become subject to significant liability through lawsuits or claims and lose future sales and customers and there is no assurance that our product liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any successful claims   techniques used to defeat online security measures are constantly evolving and may not be discovered until after the secured inf ormation has already been compromised therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniques react in a timely manner or implement adequate preventative measures        the financial reporting obligations of being a public company in the united states a re expensive and time consuming and may place significant demands on the companys management   the obligations of being a public company in the united states require significant expenditures and place certain demands on our management including costs r esulting from public company reporting obligations under the exchange act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices including those under the sarbanesoxley act of  and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that the company complies with all of these requirements moreover despite recent reforms made possible by the jumpstart our business startups act the reporting requirements rules and regulations increase the companys legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly any changes that the company makes to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow it to satisfy its obligations as a public company on a timely basis or at all   we also expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for it to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to a ccept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage these factors also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors particularly to serve on its audit and compensation committees or as executive officers   our failure to manage or adequately address any one or more of these risks could result in our business suffering a material adverse effect   item b unresolved staff co mments   none   item  properties     the companys corporate headquarters are located

thereafter nor when or if our operations will become profitable we will require additional financing both for the remainder of fiscal  and thereafter to continue to operate and expand our business there is no assurance that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates including those related to customer programs and incentives bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations impairment or disposal of longlived assets contingencies and litigation  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions        we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results     ● revenue recognition   ● impairment or disposal of longlived assets   ● deferred taxes   ● accounting for stockbased compensation and   ● commitments and contingencies   revenue recognition    revenue is recognized for digital water marking based on a contracted usage schedule on a monthly billing cycle software revenue and other services are recognized in accordance with the terms of the specific agreement which is generally upon delivery and when accepted by customer  maintenance support and service revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement in order to recognize revenue we must not have any continuing obligations and it must also be probable that we will collect the accounts receivable   impairment or disposal of longlived assets   longlived assets are reviewed in accordance with asc topic   impairment or disposal of longlived assets losses are recognized in the period the impairment or disposal occurs     deferred taxes   we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized     accounting for stockbased compensation under asc topic  stock compensation formerly referred to as sfas no r the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the blackscholes option pricing model the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the option vesting term the amount of expense attributed is based on estimated forfeiture rate which is updated based on actual forfeitures as appropriate this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the company®€™s common stock prevesting forfeiture rate and an option®€™s expected life the financial statements include amounts that are based on the company®€™s best estimates and judgments   commitments and contingencies we account for commitments and contingencies in accordance with asc topic  contingencies for merly referred to as financial accounting standards board statement no  accounting for contingencies we record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable     results of operations   revenues   revenue s for the year ended december    fiscal     were  and for the year ended december    fiscal    ” were  all revenues for fiscal  were derived from a license agreement for digital watermarking we had one customer which accounted for  of the revenue   expenses   total operating expense s for fiscal  were  compared with  for fiscal  for the year  cost of sales were  as compared with  for fiscal    our management and employee agreed to no compensation for fiscal  and  product marketing costs increased due to management’s decision to direct our efforts toward the current customer in additional divisions and additional potential customers through effort of management   administrative expenses have decreased due to management decision not to offer a private placement and an additional exchange   during the year ended december   in connection with the settlements of accounts payable we wrote off accounts payable obligations of  and recorded a gain of         fiscal    versus fiscal      research and development expenses consisted primarily of contractors compensation hardware software licensing fees and new product applications for our proprietary mediasentinel™ with a related party  research and development expenses increased to  for fiscal  from  for the comparable period in fiscal    selling general and administrative expenses were   for fiscal  as compared to  for fiscal  selling general and administrative expenses consisted of marketing expenses consulting fees noncash compensation office professional fees and other expenses to execute our business plan and for daytoday operations the primary components of the decreases from fiscal  to fiscal  were     ● a   decrease in fiscal  in professional fees was due to services performed for the private placement and     ● a   decrease in loss due to foreign currency transitions   net losses   to date we have not achieved profitability and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future our net loss for fiscal  was  compared with a net loss of  for fiscal    liquidity and capital resources   at december   our cash position was  a decrease of  from december   we had a negative working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of  at december     our principal source of cash during fiscal  was  from management from advances   we have historically satisfied our capital needs primarily by shareholders’ loans and issuing equity securities to our officers directors employees and a small group of investors and from shortterm bridge loans from members of management   our independent registered public accounting firm in their report accompanying our audited financial statements at and for the year ended december   have stated that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of december   we had  in cash we will require an additional  million to  million to finance operations for the fiscal  and we intend to obtain such financing through sales of our equity securities the threat to our ability to continue as a going concern will be removed only when revenues have reached a level that sustains our business operations   assuming the aforementioned   million to  million in financing is obtained continuing operations for the longerterm will be supported through anticipated growth in revenues and through additional sales of our securities although longerterm financing requirements may vary depending upon our sales performance management expects that we will require additional financing of  million to  million for fiscal  we have no binding commitments or arrangements for additional financing and there is no assurance that management will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms acceptable to us if at all   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of fiscal  we have no offbalance sheet arrangements   item a       quantitative

     control and procedures   our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules ae and de as of the end of the period covered by this report   in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives   no system of controls can prevent errors and fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system ’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some people by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with its policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   subject to the limitations above management believes that the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented   based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules ae and de were not effective as a result of the weaknesses in the design of our internal control over financial reporting   based upon their evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective  the material weaknesses in our internal controls related to a lack of segregation of duties due to inadequate staffing within our accounting department and upper management the assignment of authority and responsibility lack of consistent policies and procedures inadequate monitoring controls and inadequate disclosure controls   there were no changes in our internal controls that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   we are committed to improving our financial organization  as part of this commitment we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to our company   in addition management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses i insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements and ii ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes  further management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result in proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department  additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support our company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur        we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements as necessary
