payment processing market in india the majority of personal payments are made in person with cash and most routine services are paid in advance effecting the simplest transactions eg buying cellphone minutes paying for cable or satellite television time and paying electric or water bills can be both time consuming and inconvenient typically each service has its own payment location meaning travel can be significant and waiting lines can be long in addition workers moving from the country to the city find the process of sending money home in cash or by courier can be risky unreliable and expensive it is difficult to confirm receipt of the funds transfer and the recipient may experience significant delays in receiving the money moneyonmobile business model in india consumers are often required to prepay for certain utilities such as mobile phone services or their electricity and because bank accounts and credit cards are only used by a small portion of the indian population currently there are approximately  million credit cards in use for a population of approximately  billion people consumers typically prepay for their utilities with cash either directly to utility providers or through distributors moneyonmobile offers electronic wallet services mwallet similar to carrying a prepaid debit card using the consumers mobile phone moneyonmobile is the first

table of contents risk factors investing in our common stock and warrants involves significant risks before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and other information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus in particular you should consider the risks related to this offering described below our business prospects financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed as a result of any of these risks in this event the market price of our common stock and warrants could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment risks relating to the company we have incurred significant losses since inception we had an accumulated deficit of  million as of december   we have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as such we are subject to all risks incidental to the sales and development of our product offerings and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business additionally the companys unaudited interim financial statements as of december   and audited financial statements as of march   have been prepared on the assumption that the company will continue as a going concern our independent accountants have issued in their report stating that our recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern our success will be dependent on local management team for the foreseeable future we believe our success depends on the continued service of local management although we currently intend to retain our existing management we cannot assure such individuals will remain with us we have no employment agreements with any individuals the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key executives directors or advisors or our inability to find suitable replacements within a reasonable period of time following any such loss could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our business plan and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to raise the additional capital necessary to execute our business strategy which could result in curtailment of our operations our ability to raise additional capital is uncertain and dependent on numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to economic conditions and availability or lack of availability of credit if we are unable to obtain additional financing or if the terms thereof are too costly we may be forced to curtail operations until such time as alternative financing is arranged that would have a material adverse impact on our planned operations evolving products and technological changes could make our services obsolete we anticipate the services we offer will continue to evolve and be subject to technological change accordingly our ability to maintain a competitive advantage and build the business requires us to continually invest in research and development many of the companies we expect to compete with have greater capital resources research and development staffs and facilities our services could be rendered obsolete by the introduction and market acceptance of competing services technological advances by current or potential competitors or other approaches additionally our processing technology platform will require upgrades to meet our business plan and new problems or delays could develop and limit our ability to grow we anticipate the industry in which we operates will be subject to intense competition there are several direct competitors conducting business in india and some have access to large markets of existing phone subscribers once these companies fully implement their strategies the competition in india for the services being provided by us may intensify significantly      table of contents a significant portion of our total assets consists of goodwill which is subject to a periodic impairment analysis and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period we have goodwill totaling  million at december   resulting from our moneyonmobile acquisition we evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates at least once a year this estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecast the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies or there is a permanent negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units these changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material noncash charge to our results of operations we are subject to the risks faced by new businesses moneyonmobile is an earlystage company with a limited operating history and lacks profitability in recent periods and is therefore subject to many of the risks and uncertainties faced by new enterprises there is no assurance we will be able to manage its business effectively identify employ and retain any needed management or technical personnel further develop and implement its services obtain thirdparty contracts or financing or achieve the other components of its business plan there is no assurance we will achieve or sustain profitability political economic social and other factors in india may adversely affect businesses the ability for businesses to grow may be adversely affected by political economic and social factors or changes in indian law or regulations or the status of indias relations with other countries in addition there may be significant differences between the indian and us economies such as the rate of gross domestic product growth the rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments positions government actions in the future could have a significant effect on the indian economy and have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve business objectives terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war within india or involving india and other countries could adversely affect the financial markets and businesses terrorist attacks and other acts of violence could have the direct effect of destroying property causing a loss and interruption of business for example india has from time to time experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries such as pakistan the longstanding dispute with pakistan over the border indian states of jammu and kashmir remains unresolved if the indian government is unable to control the violence and disruption associated with these tensions the results could destabilize the economy and consequently adversely affect businesses also india has seen an increase in politically motivated insurgencies and a fairly active communist following any hostilities or civil unrest could adversely influence the indian economy and as a result negatively affect businesses changes in the exchange rate of the indian rupee versus the us dollar result in earnings volatility and could negatively impact our reported earnings and the ultimate return on our investment moneyonmobiles functional currency is the indian rupee and its financial statements must be converted to us dollars when preparing our financial statements changes in the exchange rate between the two currencies can cause reported financial results to fluctuate and a weakening rupee relative to the us dollar would negatively impact our earnings additionally the return on our investment in dppl and mmpl if any may be less than expected if the exchange rates are less favorable at the time of realization exchange controls in india may limit our ability to utilize cash flow effectively we are subject to indias rules and regulations on currency conversion with respect to our investments in dppl and mmpl in india the foreign exchange management act fema regulates the conversion of the indian rupee into foreign currencies today companies in many industries are permitted to operate in india without any special restrictions effectively placing them on par with wholly indianowned companies foreign exchange controls also have been substantially relaxed however the indian foreign exchange market      table of contents is not yet fully developed and there is no assurance the indian authorities will not revert to regulating companies and imposing new restrictions on the convertibility of the indian rupee any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to repatriate india earnings or receive dividends we may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the us against dppl and mmpl dppl and mmpl are organized in india and all of their assets are located in india as a result in the event of a dispute between us and either or both of dppl or mmpl we may be unable to effect service of process upon either or both of dppl or mmpl outside of india in addition we may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in us courts against either or both of dppl or mmpl risks relating to industry the payments industry is highly competitive and we expect to compete with larger firms having greater financial resources such competition could increase and adversely influence our prices to merchants and our operating margins we compete in a highly competitive market with a wide variety of processing service providers developing and maintaining our growth will depend on a combination of the continued growth in electronic payment transactions and our ability to increase our market share if competition causes us to reduce the prices we charge we will have to aggressively control our costs in order to maintain acceptable results of operations our continued growth depends on our ability to maintain or increase our average net revenue yield one of the key measures we use to assess our financial performance is our average net revenue yield which we calculate by dividing adjusted net revenue by the total payment volume of the transactions we process our average net revenue yield may be affected by a number of factors including increased competition pressure from merchants andor agents and acquisitions in order to maintain our competitiveness we must continue to ensure that our payment processing system provides a more convenient and attractive option for both merchants and customers than alternative systems that may not require payment of a processing fee retail banks and various payment service providers are already and may become available to our consumers to attract consumers we also offer certain services on a commissionfree basis such as peertopeer transfers and certain payments in ecommerce despite our efforts consumers may still choose to use other payment systems even if those systems do not offer the convenience that we do because they charge lower fees in addition because agents are able to switch between different payment processing systems we may face additional pressure to reduce the fees we charge due to increased competition from other payment service providers we are subject to the economic risk and business cycles of our merchants and agents and the overall level of consumer spending the payment services industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer spending we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence consumer spending consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits economic factors such as employment levels business conditions energy and fuel costs interest rates inflation rate and the strength of the rupee against foreign currencies could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits if our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using our services or consumers spend less money per transaction we will have fewer transactions to process at lower amounts resulting in lower revenue a further weakening in the economy could have a negative impact on our merchants as well as consumers who purchase products and services using our payment processing systems which could in turn negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations particularly if the recessionary environment disproportionately affects some of the market segments that represent a larger portion of our payment processing volume in addition these factors could force some of our merchants andor agents to liquidate their operations or go bankrupt or could cause our agents to reduce the number of their locations or hours of operation resulting in reduced transaction volumes we also have a certain amount of fixed costs including salaries and rent which could limit our ability to adjust costs and respond quickly to changes affecting the economy and our business      table of contents we do not control the rates of the fees levied by our agents on consumers our agents pay us an agreed fee using a portion of the fees levied by them on consumers the fee paid to us by the agent is based on a percentage of the value of each transaction that we process however in certain cases the amount of fees levied by an agent on a consumer for each particular transaction is determined by such agent at its own discretion we do not cap the amount of such fees or otherwise control it we believe that the fees set by our agents are marketdriven and that our interests and our agents interests are aligned with a view to maintaining fees at a level that would simultaneously result in our agents profitability and customer satisfaction however we can provide no assurance that our agents will not raise fees to a level that will adversely affect the popularity of our products among consumers at the same time if we are forced to cap customer fees to protect the strength of our brand or otherwise we may lose a significant number of agents which would reduce the penetration of our physical distribution network in limited instances we have introduced such caps at the request of our merchants no assurance can be made that this trend will not increase material increases in customer fees by our agents or the imposition of caps on the rates of such fees by us could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a decline in the use of cash as a means of payment or a decline in the use of our merchants may result in a reduced demand for our services substantially all of our business is in india where a substantial part of the population relies on cash payments rather than credit and debit card payments or electronic banking we believe that our profitability depends on the use of cash as a means of payment and the reach of our merchant network there can be no assurance that over time the prevalence of cash payments will not decline as a greater percentage of the population in emerging markets adopts credit and debit card payments and electronic banking the shift from cash payments to credit and debit card payments and electronic banking could reduce our market share and payment volumes and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations risks relating to acquisitions revenues and profits generated by acquired businesses or account portfolios may be less than anticipated resulting in losses or a decline in profits as well as potential impairment charges in evaluating and determining the purchase price for a prospective acquisition we estimate the future revenues and profits from that acquisition based on the historical revenue of the acquired provider of payment processing services or portfolio of merchant accounts following an acquisition it is customary to experience some attrition in the number of merchants serviced by an acquired provider of payment processing services or included in an acquired portfolio of merchant accounts should the rate of postacquisition merchant attrition exceed the rate we forecast the revenues and profits generated by the acquired providers of payment processing services or portfolio of accounts may be less than we estimated which could result in losses or a decline in profits as well as potential impairment charges we may fail to uncover all liabilities of acquisition targets through the due diligence process prior to an acquisition exposing us to potentially significant unanticipated costs prior to the consummation of any acquisition we perform a due diligence review of the business or portfolio of merchant accounts that we propose to acquire our due diligence review however may not adequately uncover all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the proposed acquisition for example in the past we may have been obligated to fund certain credits and chargebacks after discovering that a merchant account from an acquired merchant processing portfolio was in substantial violation of the visa and mastercard card association rules in the future we may make acquisitions that may obligate us to make similar payments resulting in potentially significant unanticipated costs      table of contents we may not be able to integrate acquired companies or assets or potential future acquisitions into our company and resources available to assist our acquisitions may be insufficient we have made strategic acquisitions and we intend to continue to make such acquisitions in accordance with our business plan each acquisition involves a number of risks including  the diversion of our managements attention to the assimilation and ongoing assistance with the operations and personnel of the acquired business which could strain managements resources  the potential for our affiliated companies to grow rapidly and adversely affect our ability to assist our affiliated companies as intended  possible adverse effects on our results of operations and cash flows  possible inability by us to achieve our intended objective or goals of the acquisition  possible inability by acquisition to retain and maintain strategic vendors or employees and  our inability to assist our affiliated companies as intended or to acquire and integrate businesses under our business plan could negatively impact our operations financial results and cash flows risks relating to government regulation the payments industry in india is subject to extensive regulation payment system operators like moneyonmobile are subject to the indian payments and settlement systems act  and operate under the authority and board oversight of the reserve bank of india rbi although the rbi has reviewed the operations systems and processes of moneyonmobile and has licensed it to operate a payments system in india through october   the rbi has the authority to revoke this license at any time should moneyonmobiles operations not continue to meet standards primarily relating to the custody of and accountability for consumer funds such revocation would seriously and negatively affect the value of moneyonmobile in addition increased regulatory focus could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the services moneyonmobile provides we are subject to federal and state laws regarding antimoney laundering including the patriot act and if we break any of these laws we could be subject to significant fines andor penalties and our ability to conduct business could be limited we are subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and the requirements of the office of foreign assets control ofac which prohibit us from transmitting money to specified countries or on behalf of prohibited individuals the money transfer business has been subject to increased scrutiny following the events of september   the patriot act enacted following those events mandates several new antimoney laundering requirements the federal government or the states may elect to impose additional antimoney laundering requirements changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements including the patriot act could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operation failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal and state regulatory authorities could result in among other things revocation of required registrations loss of approved status termination of contracts with banks administrative enforcement actions and fines class action lawsuits cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability the occurrence of one or more of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if we were to inadvertently transmit money on behalf of or unknowingly conduct business with a prohibited individual we could be required to pay significant damages including fines and penalties likewise any intentional or negligent violation of antimoney laundering laws by our employees could lead to significant fines andor penalties and could limit our ability to conduct business in some jurisdiction      table of contents risks relating to our common stock changes to current accounting principles and our accounting policies could have a significant effect on the companys reported financial results or the way in which it conducts its business we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap which are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board the american institute of certified public accountants the us securities and exchange commission and various other authorities formed to interpret recommend and announce appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles andor managements own interpretation and application of such principles could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even retroactively affect the accounting for previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may

financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the value of our common stock our certificate of formation provides for the issuance of up to  million shares of what is commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock such stock may be issued by our board of directors from time to time without shareholder approval as one or more separate series of shares as designated by resolution of our board setting forth the relative rights privileges and preferences of the series including if any the i dividend rate ii price terms and conditions of redemption iii voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences iv provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase v terms of conversion to common stock including conversion price and vi voting rights the issuance of such shares with superior rights and preferences could adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock and potentially the value of our common stock our ability to issue such preferred stock also could give our board of directors the ability to hinder or discourage any attempt to gain control of us by a merger tender offer at a control premium price proxy contest or otherwise our executive officers directors and major shareholders hold a majority of our common stock and may be able to prevent other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock as a result acting together they would be able to influence many matters requiring shareholder approval including the election of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change in control and could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and may affect the market price of our stock the price of our common stock may be volatile which could cause our investors to incur trading losses and fail to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of an active trading market in our common stock the failure to achieve and maintain an active market for our common stock means that you may not be able to dispose of your common stock in a desirable manner and the price for our shares may fluctuate greatly moreover some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial

comply with public company regulations we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as other federal and state laws these requirements may place a

requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and

if any for our stockholders future sales or issuances of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock and warrants to decline the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock whether directly by us or in the secondary market by existing security holders including holders of our outstanding warrants and convertible debt the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and warrants and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities any such sales may result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders including you we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders which will result in additional dilution to you warrants are speculative due to their structure and the value of our common stock may never exceed the exercise price of the warrants the warrants do not confer any rights of common stock ownership on their holders such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends rather the warrants merely represent the right to acquire shares of our common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time specifically commencing on the date of issuance holders of the warrants may exercise their right to acquire the common stock and pay an exercise price of      per share  of public offering price of the common stock prior to five years from the date of issuance after which date any unexercised warrants will expire and have no further value moreover following this offering the market value of the warrants is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the market value of the warrants will equal or exceed their public offering price there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the warrants and consequently whether it will ever be profitable for holders of the warrants to exercise the warrants      table of contents

our core products can be broken down into two primary categories cashin transactions and cashout transactions within the cashin product category we perform cash collection services for a wide range of companies including mobile operators satellite tv providers utility companies ecommerce companies insurance companies and banks in addition to these services we originate domestic remittance transactions which is the sending of money from one consumer within india to another consumer within the cashout product category we enable consumers to withdraw cash from their bank accounts we also allow consumers to access their bank account balance for making purchases at any moneyonmobile retail shop competition moneyonmobile experiences and will experience intense competition from companies developing digital payment and ewallet technologies many of these companies have substantially greater financial technological research and development marketing and personnel resources paytm mobikwik and freecharge are only payment mechanisms they only allow you to buy something at a store using a protocol like an app on apple pay moneyonmobile is really fundamentally quite different for a couple of reasons one is were a business opportunity for our agents they make money on moneyonmobile they dont make money processing transactions for our competitors      table of contents second our cost of processing the marginal transaction is extremely low very very low in fact and we can therefore handle very small transactions paytm and the others load value into their digital wallet using traditional credit or debit cards requiring the consumer to have a bank account so their marginal transaction cost is a lot higher governmental regulation the industry in which we operate is subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations in the united states and india there are numerous laws and regulations restricting the purchase sale and sharing of personal information about consumers many of which are new and continue to evolve accordingly it is difficult to determine whether and how existing and proposed privacy laws may apply to our businesses in the future also there are numerous consumer statutes and regulations including the grammleachbliley act regarding the possession of both consumer and merchantlevel data with which we must comply furthermore government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in increased regulation of our products resulting in a greater regulatory burden for us payment system operators in india are subject to

organizations code or the tboc our certificate of formation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult acquisitions of us by means of a tender offer a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our directors these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management it is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares in addition because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock these provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids these provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us we believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because among other things negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms limitations on liability and indemnification of officers and directors the tboc authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties subject to certain exceptions our certificate of formation and bylaws include provisions that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent permitted under the tboc the effect of these provisions eliminate the rights of us and our shareholders through shareholders derivative suits on our behalf to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior however exculpation will not apply to any director if the director has acted in bad faith knowingly or intentionally violated the law authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived an improper benefit from his or her actions as a director our bylaws provide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the tboc we also carry directors and officers liability insurance providing indemnification for our directors officers and certain employees for some liabilities we believe that these indemnification and advancement provisions and insurance will be useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers the limitation of liability indemnification and advancement provisions in our certificate of formation and bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty these provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders in addition your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions there is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors officers or employees for which indemnification is sought authorized but unissued shares our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without shareholder approval we may use additional shares for a variety of purposes including future public offerings to raise additional capital to fund acquisitions and as employee compensation the existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred

the open market these transactions may include short sales purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of securities than they are required to purchase in the offering covered short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shares of securities in the offering the underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising the overallotment option or purchasing shares of securities in the open market in determining the source of shares of securities to close out the covered short position the underwriters will consider among other things the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the overallotment option naked short sales are sales in excess of the overallotment option the underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing securities in the open market a naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our securities in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of shares of securities made by the underwriters in the open market before the completion of the offering similar to other purchase transactions the underwriters purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our securities or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our securities as result the price of our securities may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market the underwriters have advised us that pursuant to regulation m under the exchange act they may also engage in other activities that stabilize maintain or otherwise affect the price of our securities including the imposition of penalty bids this means that if the representative of the underwriters purchases securities in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales the representative can require the underwriters that sold those shares as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them the underwriters make no representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
