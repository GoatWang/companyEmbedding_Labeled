kahului hawaii and santa monica calif aug   prnewswire  flikmedia inc formerly crossbox inc otcbb flkm announced today that it has completed the acquisition of flikdate inc wwwflikdatecom through a merger transaction consummated on july    the company announced that as a result of the flikdate™ merger that they are now a digital media company focused on designing developing and bringing to market proprietary and patented video applications for use on mobile platforms  as a result we changed our trading symbol from cbxx to flkm flikdate™ has developed a patented software application for ios and android mobile devices to enable men and women to engage in live video social dating interaction on their smartphones referred to as a social discovery application for online dating  the technology permits users to go on a virtual date and quickly swipe  or flik in the parlance of the application – between multiple users at any given time we believe that flikdate™ is the worlds first video speed dating platform which was also developed with an internal monetization process whereby users create revenue events for the company each time the video dating service is utilized flikmedia owns intellectual property that we rely on for our primary mobile app flikdate™ including our proprietary software for integrated video delivery and mobile video monetization uspto registration us a our technology powers the flikdate™ application mr nick bicanic the chief executive officer of both flikmedia and flikdate stated we believe that the intellectual property we have created enables the process of leveraging direct video interactions and it has potential implications far beyond the social and dating interaction areas of digital media we are enthusiastic about flikdate™ and also believe that our technology will enable us to build flick media as a platform for video based interaction and communication well beyond the internet dating industry flikdate™ enables users to quickly test their instant chemistry through video on their smartphone facetoface dates are intended to save users hours of time over legacy online dating sites and help avoid uncomfortable – or unsafe – real world encounters with members who do not match their profile and or their picture making flikdate™ an extremely safe dating authentication application for mobile users according to independent research firm ibis world the online dating industry historically generates revenue principally from monthly subscriptions usd  billion in  mr bicanic noted we believe existing legacy subscription business model does not optimize revenue or user experience in the mobile environment  our flikdate™ technology has been engineered for a clearly defined transactional revenue model to enable us to avoid a subscription based model entirely through the sale of a virtual currency called fliks  fliks permit members to play or engage people they are interested in by swiping through recommended members each swipe uses a flik fliking is designed to increase user engagement by being more like a game  we believe the gamification of dating is important to expanding our potential market audience and our revenue generating capabilities mr arben kryeziu the co inventor of flikdate™ and our chief technology officer added we believe that the nature of human behavior is to continue to look at potential matches and the individual users selection process for people that they would like to actually chat and or meet with for a date strongly supports this incremental revenue model of course some people will purchase more fliks than others but we feel confident that our model will be more sustainable and potentially more lucrative than monthly subscriptions that turn over frequently according to independent research firm newzoo an international full service market research and consulting firm focused completely on the games industry the mobile casual gaming revenues surpassed usd  billion in  or  of the global games market and in  mobile game spending will surpass usd  billion or  of the total market mr bicanic stated the success that tinder and snapchat have enjoyed as a result of rapid consumer adoption as casual social interaction platforms is further evidence that we are in an engaging and potentially rewarding space with our proprietary video based application however we believe they lack the transactional revenue model that flikdate™ has integrated from its beginning mr bicanic also noted the early critics of facebook™ did not believe that the company could transition into a mobile monetization model and they have been proven wrong  we believe that mobile online dating monetization has the potential to follow a similar customer utilization trajectory when compared to brands such as facebook™ and snap chat™ the flikdate™ application has already received media attention including appearances on  television via the good morning america show the steve harvey show and in print within gq magazine and the usa today newspaper publication mr bicanic also stated we believe the fundamentals of the mobile online dating business are favorable according to ibis world a leading publisher of business information since 9 the dating services industry continues to expect strong demand in the next five years and  the estimated revenue for the mobile dating market is expected to nearly double in the next five years with rising smartphone adoption and new locationbased features leading the market  ibis world also expects continued consolidation within the dating services industry which has risen throughout the past five years and concludes that industry consolidation is largely the result of increased mergers and acquisitions as larger companies acquire wellestablished dating sites and companies to increase the density of their consumer bases in anticipation of the flikdate™ acquisition crossbox inc recently changed its name to flikmedia inc  under the terms of the transaction flikmedia issued shares of our common stock to the former flikdate™ inc stockholders representing  of our  currently outstanding shares  the
