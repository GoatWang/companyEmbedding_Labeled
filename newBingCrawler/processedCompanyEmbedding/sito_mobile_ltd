mobile advertisingfeb  about sito mobile sito growthhunter longshort equity tech oil  gas commoditiessummarysito mobile has had a rough couple months  down  since october and as much as  on mondaydespite  challenges company is well positioned in growing locationtargeted mobile advertising marketvaluation is compelling given future growth prospects and tubemogul comparisonoverview sito mobile ltd nasdaqsito operates a mobile locationbased advertising platform serving businesses advertisers and brands the companys main offering is sito locationbased advertising which uses geofencing technology and big data to deliver highvalue display and video ads to likely buyers within a certain radius of advertisers locations over the past few months the company has had its fair share of headwinds after posting lowerthanexpected q results due to a seasonally weak advertising period the company prereleased disappointing q revenue figures in january despite management previously guiding towards a seasonally strong fourth quarter given the holiday season to compound these issues the market reacted negatively to the news that the ceo resigned last friday sending the stock  lower as of midday monday to share  below the october high of  given the recent performance under the former ceo i have believed a new ceo would be necessary and at these levels the stock is attractive source stockchartscom strong product in growing market fortunately for shareholders the company has a differentiated product in an advertising market niche that is projected to grow significantly for the foreseeable future as seen in the table below total us locationtargeted mobile ad spending is expected to grow from b in  to b in  as a percentage of total us mobile ad spending locationtargeted spending is expected to increase from  to  reflecting its increased importance as part of the overall us mobile advertising mix source emarketer as one of the early movers sito mobile is using its demandside and data management platforms to build a increasingly large presence in the locationbased mobile advertising space the companys inhouse platforms reportedly collects and analyzes over  trillion data pointsmonth device id location data time information etc then uses that data to connect advertisers to publishers and automatically bids on inapp advertisements on consumers mobile phones based on their specific profiles and location the company calls this following the digital breadcrumbs to target the right audience and deliver ads to the right people at the right time source company presentation sitos platform proprietary data and analytical tools allow companies target only those consumers most likely to be interested in their product or service at the time and place when they are most likely to buy as a result of the companys unique customertargeting data and analytical platform sito boasts relatively strong clickthrough rates ctr in key industry verticals versus industry averages source company presentation although many companies have attempted to provide locationtargeted mobile advertising tools according to emarketer many marketing professionals have historically cited their inability to measure success as the reason they have held back spending in the space source statista when it comes to measuring the success of their locationtargeted campaigns this is where sito sets itself apart sitos verified walkin product lets marketers see not only if customers clicked on the ad sent to their mobile device but more importantly if they then went to the store and made a purchase this ability allows sito customers to optimize their platform in realtime source company presentation when combined with the precise audiencetargeting capabilities of the sito platform the vwi component is attracting increased attention from agencies and brands and should continue to give sito a competitive advantage in the industry valuation after the  share price decline over the last few months shares of sito are trading at x ttm revenue down from x during september  source ychartscom given the growth outlook for the locationbased mobile advertising industry as a whole and the quality of sitos offering there are high expectations for the companys revenue growth over the next few years source simplywallst based on consensus estimates it is expected that the company will generate m of revenue and m of ebitda in  although i believe this is conservative given the level of locationtargeted mobile advertising expected in the united states alone even at these conservative levels the stock is cheap based on a ps e multiple of x the company should trade for share second based on the recent industry acquisition of tubemogul by adobe nasdaqadbe which was priced at x evebitda e sito should be trading close to share source internal model given the recent departure of the ceo which i believe could be a turning point for the company and the low bar set by q and q performance i see shares in the company rebounding over the next few months at any sign of sales momentum or an announcement of an industry veteran ceo taking the helm downside risks as with any technology company sito is vulnerable to another company developing a new technology that more effectively attacks the mobile advertising market second should sito be unable to regain sales momentum the company may need to issue equity to pay down debt resulting in dilution for existing shareholders finally if larger players in the mobile advertising arena google facebook etc decide to compete in the locationtargeted industry it would force me to reevaluate my opinion of sitos growth prospects summary following a  decline in its share price since september an investment in sito mobile seems to represent an attractive riskreward opportunity the company is wellpositioned in the growing locationtargeted mobile advertising industry with data on millions of mobile users and a superior product that enables advertisers to more efficiently target their advertisements and track campaign performance given the growth prospects for the company and its relatively low valuation i believe if sito can reignite its revenue growth after two disappointing quarters shares could significantly appreciate to share over the next  months disclosure i amwe are long sito i wrote this
