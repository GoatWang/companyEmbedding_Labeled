company is not only opening new stores but also taking over chains operated by other clothing producers próchnik sa is among the oldest and best known polish clothing brands it was among the first five companies to be listed on the warsaw stock exchange however the past few years have been unsuccessful for próchnik as far as the companys financial performance is concerned the company struggled with serious problems requiring changes in the product range along with an injection of extra capital in the company the implementation of a new strategy by próchnik was made possible by zl million raised from a new share issue in the spring of this year some of the funds raised from the issue were invested in the production of new collections and the opening of company showrooms for the fall season próchnik for the first time prepared womens outer wear alongside mens suits and shirts until recently the company specialized exclusively in the production of mens coats and jackets próchniks fall collection has generated much interest on the market the companys revenue in the third quarter of the year exceeded zl million twice as much as in the same time of last year the third quarter was a breakthrough period for the companys business said miko³aj habit vicepresident of próchnik sa it showed that funds from the last issue not only saved the company from collapse but also paved the way for its dynamic development today próchnik is one of the fastest growing clothing companies in poland and is planning another share issue to strengthen its distribution network just recently the company signed a preliminary agreement for the purchase of  percent of £ód¼s pabia company active in the distribution of womens clothing through a chain of company stores próchnik will pay zl million for pabia along with  stores at the moment próchnik is in talks with the wkruk company to buy deni cler a company that sells exclusive womens clothing simon prochnik  comparative plant and algal genomics  doe joint genome institute doe joint genome institute our science home › our science › scientists at jgi › simon prochnik – comparative plant and algal genomics simon prochnik – comparative plant and algal genomics simon prochnik education phd in genetics university of edinburgh uk ba ma in genetics university of cambridge uk summary simon prochnik joined the jgi nearly ten years ago to work on the genome of the singlecelled green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii he has continued to lead computational analysis of the genome sequences of singlecelled eukaryotes and algae more recently his interests have turned to leveraging genomics for improving crops such as citrus and cassava research interests there are two major themes to simon’s research the evolution of complexity and the studying natural diversity and ancestry in crops to understand and predict potential improvements he compares the proteins encoded by various organisms to detect unique sets of proteins with unique functions for example a comparison of proteins encoded in the chlamydomonas genome to those of other organisms revealed catalogs of genes that are involved in photosynthesis many of which were unknown despite decades of research this gene catalog is helping us understand how plants convert sunlight into energy the next generation cassava project from the bill and melinda gates foundation and the uk department for international development to cornell university funds his work on improving cassava a crop that feeds some  million people daily yet suffers from poor yields and diseases a technique called genotypingbysequencing generates very high resolution genetic fingerprints which he has used to make a  detailed genetic map and genome assembly of cassava by comparing the traits and the fingerprints of wild cassava and farmer varieties he is tracing natural variation that may help improve yields and disease resistance awards and service instructor cold spring harbor programming for
