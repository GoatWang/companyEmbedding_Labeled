subculture and art movement developed by africanamericans  puerto ricans  from the south bronx in new york city during the late s while people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called mcing or emceeing a rhythmic vocal rhyming style orality djing and turntablism which is making music with record players and dj mixers auralsound and music creation bboyingbgirlingbreakdancing movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s with the rise of new media platforms and web  fans discovered and downloaded or

been credited with coining the term in  while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the madeup words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into his stage performance the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them hip hoppers the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture the song rappers delight by the sugarhill gang released in  begins with the phrase i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you dont stop lovebug starski a bronx dj who put out a single called the positive life in  and dj hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music bill alder an independent consultant once said there was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground one of the very first socalled rap records was a monster hit rappers delight by the sugar hill gang on sugarhill records hip hop pioneer and south bronx community leader afrika bambaataa also credits lovebug starski as the first to use the term hip hop as it relates to the culture bambaataa former leader of the black spades gang also did much to further popularize the term the words hip hop first appeared in print on september   in the village voice in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st martins press historyedit sedit dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically dj kool herc is a pioneer in developing hip hop music djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late s djs were releasing inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at  sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song kc the prince of soul a rapperlyricist with pete dj jones is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx and much of the graffiti rapping and bboying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and oneupmanship of street gangs sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation a loose confederation of streetdance crews graffiti artists and rap musicians by the late s the culture had gained media attention with billboard magazine printing an article titled b beats bombarding bronx commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc the new york city blackout of  saw widespread looting arson and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores as a result the hip hop genre barely known outside of the bronx at the time grew at an astounding rate from  onward afrika bambaataa with dj yutaka of universal zulu nation in  dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people hosted in parks these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers where instead of getting into trouble on the streets teens now had a place to expend their pentup energy tony tone a member of the cold crush brothers stated that hip hop saved a lot of lives for innercity youth participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture mc kid lucky mentions that people used to breakdance against each other instead of fightingfull citation needed inspired by dj kool herc afrika bambaataa created a street organization called universal zulu nation centered around hip hop as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life drugs and violence the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues most notably in the seminal track the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the s and s to show the limitations of the movement hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard like rockandroll hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticises violence lawbreaking and gangs it also gave people a chance for financial gain by reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns in late  debbie harry of blondie took nile rodgers of chic to such an event as the main backing track used was the break from chics good times the new style influenced harry and blondies later hit single from  rapture became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the us billboard hot —the song itself is usually considered new wave and fuses heavy pop music elements but there is an extended rap by harry near the end ronald beestinger savage is an entrepreneur hiphop artist author and activist sedit hip hop as a culture was further defined in  when afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force released the electrofunk track planet rock instead of simply rapping over disco beats bambaataa with producer arthur baker created an electronic sound taking advantage of the rapidly improving drum machine roland tr synthesizer technology as well as sampling from kraftwerk planet rock is widely regarded as a turning point fusing electro with hip hop was like a light being switched on resulting in a new genre other groundbreaking records released in  were the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five nunk by warp  man parrishs hip hop be bop dont stop whodinis magic wand and malcolm

became the dominant cultural movement of the minoritypopulated urban communities in the s the s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop in  melle mel and duke bootee recorded the message officially credited to grandmaster flash and the furious five a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of rundmcs its like that and public enemys black steel in the hour of chaos during the s hip hop also embraced the creation of rhythm by using the human body via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing pioneers such as doug e fresh biz markie and buffy from the fat boys made beats rhythm and musical sounds using their mouth lips tongue voice and other body parts human beatbox artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds the appearance of music videos changed entertainment they often glorified urban neighborhoods the music video for planet rock showcased the subculture of hip hop musicians graffiti artists and bboysbgirls many hip hoprelated films were released between  and  among them wild style beat street krush groove breakin and the documentary style wars these films expanded the appeal of hip hop beyond the boundaries of new york by  youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture the hip hop artwork and slang of us urban communities quickly found its way to europe as the cultures global appeal took rootcitation needed the four traditional dances of hip hop are rocking bboyingbgirling locking and popping all of which trace their origins to the late s or early s women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the bronx nevertheless as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music there were many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj reaching platinum status sedit icet with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early s the emphasis in lyrics shifted to drugs violence and misogyny early proponents of gangsta rap included groups and artists such as icet who recorded what some consider to be the first gangster rap record  n the mornin and nwa whose second album niggazlife became the first gangsta rap album to enter the charts at number one gangsta rap also played an important part in hip hop becoming a mainstream commodity that albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience as a result gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of ghettos while hip hop music now appeals to a broader demographic media critics argue that socially and politically conscious hip hop has been largely disregarded by mainstream america global innovationsedit british hip hop artist and poet kate tempest performs her signature piece let them eat chaos at the  treefort music fest in boise idaho according to the us department of state hip hop is now the center of a mega music and fashion industry around the world that crosses social barriers and cuts across racial lines national geographic recognizes hip hop as the worlds favorite youth culture in which just about every country on the planet seems to have developed its own local rap scene through its international travels hip hop is now considered a global musical epidemic according to the village voice hip hop is custommade to combat the anomie that preys on adolescents wherever nobody knows their name hip hop sounds and styles dd styles differ from region to region but there are also instances of fusion genres hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by  million fans worldwide this was made possible by the adaptation of music in different locations and the influence on style of behavior and dress not all countries have embraced hip hop where as can be expected in countries with strong local culture the interloping wildstyle of hip hop is not always welcomed this is somewhat the case in jamaica the homeland of the cultures father dj kool herc however despite hip hop music produced on the island lacking widespread local and international recognition artists such as five steez have defied the odds by impressing online hip hop tastemakers and even reggae critics hartwig vens argues that hip hop can also be viewed as a global learning experience author jeff chang argues that the essence of hip hop is the cipher born in the bronx where competition and community feed each other he also adds thousands of organizers from cape town to paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice policing and prisons media justice and education while hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music from the rest of the world a musical cross pollination has taken place which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities hip hops messages allow the underprivileged and the mistreated to be heard these cultural translations cross borders while the music may be from a foreign country the message is something that many people can relate to something not foreign at all even when hip hop is transplanted to other countries it often retains its vital progressive agenda that challenges the status quo in gothenburg sweden nongovernmental organizations ngos incorporate graffiti and dance to engage disaffected immigrant and working class youths hip hop has played a small but distinct role as the musical face of revolution in the arab

synthesis of published material that conveys ideas not attributable to the original sources relevant discussion may be found on the talk page march  learn how and when to remove this template message rapper entrepreneur and executive jayz emphasizes his wealth in the early tomid s there was no established hip hop music industry as exists in the s with record labels record producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white affluent and suburban audiences after realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on video music box darlene lewis modellyricist along with darryl washington and dean carroll brought hip hop music to the first exposure cable show on paragon cable and then created the on broadway television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals the lens through which one views the genres commercialization can make it seem positive or negative cultureedit djing and turntablism mcingrapping breakdancing graffiti art and beatboxing are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic like the blues these arts were developed by african american communities to enable people to make a statement whether political or emotional and participate in community activities these practices spread globally around the s as fans could make it their own and express themselves in new and creative ways in music dance and other arts djingedit dj qbert manipulating a record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include grandmaster flash afrika bambaataa mr magic dj jazzy jeff dj scratch from epmd dj premier from gang starr dj scott la rock from boogie down productions dj pete rock of pete rock  cl smooth dj muggs

demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills mcingedit rapper busta rhymes performs in las vegas for a bet party rapping also known as emceeing mcing spitting bars or just rhyming refers to spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment rapping typically features complex wordplay rapid delivery and a range of street slang some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form mcing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient african culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common within the afroamerican community graffitiedit an aerosol paint can a common tool used in modern graffiti graffiti is the most controversial of hip hops elements as a number of the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop including lady pink seen blade fargo cholly rock fuzz one and coco  lady pink says i don’t think graffiti is hiphop frankly i grew up with disco music theres a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself and fargo says there is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti one has nothing to do with the other hip hop pioneer grandmaster flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti saying you know what bugs me they put hip hop with graffiti how do they intertwine in america in the late s graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists gangs such as the savage skulls la familia and savage nomads used graffiti to mark territory julio  was a puerto rican graffiti writer one of the first graffiti writers in new york city he was a member of the savage skulls gang and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as  in

or logo tagging began in philadelphia and new york city and has expanded worldwide although tagging is considered as vandalism by law enforcement it is hip hops visual art and the tags are part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the bronx though the elaborate brooklyn style tracy  dubbed wildstyle would come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking was documented in style wars and was later given more focus in fictional films such as wild style and beat street early acts include the rock steady crew and new york city breakerscitation needed beatboxingedit biz markie is noted for his beatboxing skills he is holding the mic close to his mouth a technique beatboxers use to imitate deep basslines and bass drums by exploiting the proximity effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it declined in popularity along with bboying in the late s but has undergone a resurgence since the late s marked by the release of make the music  by rahzel of the roots beatmakingproducingedit a typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs

because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and cultural empowerment outside the united states members of minority communities—such as algerians in france and turks in germany—use rap as a platform to protest racism poverty and social structures

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death disease and decay ” hip hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words in particular the word bitch is seen in countless songs from a bitch iz a bitch by nwa to missy elliotts she is a bitch it is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow money grubber some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment regardless the hiphop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word bitch and whether it is necessary in rap not only the particular words but also the choice of which language in which rap is widely debated topic in international hip hop in canada the use of nonstandard variants of french such as franglais a mix of french and english by groups such as dead obies or chiac such as

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers in goldmember in which mike myers character dr evil – performing in a parody of a hiphop music video hard knock life by jayz – performs an entire verse that is blanked out in  roger ebert wrote “ rap

says its ok for a white man to burn a cross in public but nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer the white house administrations of both us presidents george h w bush and bill clinton criticized the genre the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to

hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and

blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the s stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music in particular seminal figures in the early underground politicallymotivated music such as ice t have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance critics have stated that s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of africanamerican culture and are poseur gangsters critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence comedian bill cosby states that hip hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which favors music written and performed by the individual artist as seen in some famous singersongwriterled rock bands and is against s decadeera hip hop which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit in comparison with rock some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males marginalization of womenedit hip hop artist lauryn hill has been successful as a solo performer and as a member of the fugees this photo shows her performing at the ottawa bluesfest in  the hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in africanamerican culture gangsta rap artists such as eazye dr dre and snoop dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men between  and  over  hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape assault and murder these antiwomen hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban africanamerican women hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent degrading and highly sexualized there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop and the most popular successful and influential artists record producers and music executives are males women who are in rap groups such as lauryn hill of the fugees tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists female artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in  in addition african american female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry besides icons like lauryn hill white rapper iggy azalea is the first female hip hop artist to get a number one single on the american pop charts homophobia and transphobiaedit as well the hip hop music community has been criticized for its homophobia and transphobia hip hop song lyrics contain offensive homophobic slurs most popularly the pejorative term faggot and sometimes violent threats towards queer people such as rapper dmxs where the hood at rapper eazyes nobody move rap group brand nubians punks jump up to get beat down many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia andor transphobia these artists include ja rule who in an interview claimedwe need to go step to mtv and viacom and lets talk about all these fucking shows that they have on mtv that is promoting homosexuality that my kids can’t watch this shit and rap artist erick sermon who has said publiclyhip hop will never accept transgender rappers until the s hip hop music has excluded the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community this has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in despite this prejudice some queergenderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the s one of the more notable members of the lgbt community in hip hop is frank ocean who came out in  and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two grammy awards other successful queer hip hoprap artists include female bisexual rapper azealia banks pansexual androgynous rapper and singer angel haze lesbian rapper siya and genderqueer rapper mykki blancocitation needed legacyedit this section possibly

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have been marginalized in hip hops music industryaccording to whom established artists like missy elliott lil kim and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs in addition there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish rap music has the power to influence how we view black women in our society queen latifah used her awardwinning song unity to support to other women and to inform of the presence of women in the hip hop genre however many contemporary females in hip hop do not embody this mindset and counteract it
