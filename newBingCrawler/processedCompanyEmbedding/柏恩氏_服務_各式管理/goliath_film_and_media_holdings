through its whollyowned subsidiaries goliath film and media international and goliath movie partners  llc collectively “goliath” or the “company” develops produces and licenses for distribution domestically and internationally quality digital content with an emphasis on “niche” markets of the feature motion picture and television content segments of the entertainment industry such as without limitation education faithbased horror and socially responsible minority content goliath does not intend to engage in domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures to any significant extent   in qualified cases goliath will develop screenplays that will be outsourced to an independent entity for production but will be licensed for distribution through the company also in certain cases goliath will produce content that is tied to working with an established distributor that provides an advance or minimum guarantee for the production of a project that will be licensed by the participating distributor goliath plans to produce content and to distribute domestically and internationally through a wide distribution network which includes major international theatrical exhibitors and other distributors and television networks we plan to utilize corporate sponsorships as a means of reducing the costs of advertising and marketing in distribution further we may augment our marketing efforts with a limited and strategically focused advertising campaign in traditional “print” media with press releases targeted specifically toward standard entertainment industry trade journals and publications on an “as needed” basis as well as the inclusion of targeted “social media” campaigns   goliath’s revenue model includes receiving revenue from distribution fees a limited number of its content properties include projects developed and produced by goliath and those produced by an independent third party production entity          questions and answers   what is your business   we develop produce and distribute motion pictures and digital content at this time we do not intend to engage in theatrical releases of motion pictures due to the high up front costs of advertising and marketing theatrically however in some specific cases the company will consider theatrical releases based upon a “four wall “ limited release delivery that will be focused on targeted niche audiences

summer the truth about layla living with cancer and the biggest fan  under the distribution agreements goliath will receive  of the gross revenues for each picture it distributes in general the company’s distribution contracts cover both domestic and international licensing agreements however for the picture the biggest fan the company obtained limited distribution rights no revenue has been recognized to date          production agreements   on march   goliath signed a distribution agreement with mar vista entertainment llc to distribute a feature length motion picture currently in postproduction by goliath per the agreement goliath will receive  in advance payments per an agreed delivery schedule for providing distribution rights on the motion picture “bridal bootcamp” a

distribution rights on the motion picture “terror birds” a science fiction movie produced by goliath to mar vista entertainment llc additionally mar vista entertainment llc will receive  of the gross proceeds for a period of  years on the film as of april   the company has received  of the advance payments terror birds was completed december   and mar vista is looking to distribute this film   on april   goliath signed an agreement whereby the company agreed to invest  to kko productions to produce a feature length motion picture known as “forgiven” per the agreement goliath will receive  of adjusted gross proceeds after its initial investment has been entirely recouped through adjusted gross proceed additionally the company will receive two on screen credits as executive producer as well as receiving credit on all advertising publicity and packaging of the motion picture the investment of  presented in other assets on the balance sheet has not yet been repaid due to the fact that no revenues will be generated until this motion picture’s released   what is the timeline for your activities during the next  months   over the next  days to one year our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing by them of at least three projects   what is this going to cost you   we expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately  per project however licensing and distribution will be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from  –  and the costs of advertising and marketing will be handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds   why are these motion pictures not being distributed already   the motion pictures that are being produced by the company and distributed by mar vista entertainment llc take anywhere from six to nine months from completion of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements   generically the main reason why good quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money and creativity and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills many people dream of making a movie few aspire to distribute them we estimate that there are in excess of  such motion pictures “gathering dust” there also have been and continue to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many states and international territories so that many producers do not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects a secondary factor is the difficulty of finding a reputable distributor we think that our management has an excellent reputation in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution rights for content finally many distributors as well as buyers do not have an interest in niche market films because they see the market as limited goliath sees the problem to be rather there is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of films for these niches most participants in the motion picture industry are based in “hollywood” and the major coastal metropolitan areas our “faithbased” films especially are targeted toward the “bible belt” and the “flyover country” places that the industry has consistently overlooked          why are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos   after attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years our staff has developed relationships with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product goliath has also developed vital relationships with many of the major content distributors and networks many of the filmmakers have requested the company’s assistance in marketing and distributing their product goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product that is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators distributors networks and studios   so how are you different than amazon netflix blockbuster and hulu to name a few how can you compete with them they have a lot of money and name recognition why wouldn’t they jump into your niches   as a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content as an example netflix has such a high demand for programming content they are spending  billion this year for the acquisition of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them therefore as is mentioned part of their resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting inhouse” and joint venture production of quality content this content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level   there are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors goliath is moving toward becoming one of these content providers we believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand for programming is increasing almost exponentially irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumersubscriber the demand for quality content is continuing to expand as an example there are currently approximately  original scripted programs being aired in the entire television universe – a cancellation rate of  reflects a number that represents the entire programming universe in the late ’s and early ’s the upward trend is ongoing which is where we see an opportunity for goliath to provide product to reach many components of the overall market   don’t cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like tbn for faith based and bet black entertainment television for the africanamerican community   as mentioned above about netflix even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type genre and format of the content that they are showing in order to remain viable therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming is ongoing and expanding   what other niches are you looking at entering   we believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches many viewers have cable or satellite service with hundreds of channels but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests one significant type of niche we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the united states other than spanish speaking immigrants coverage is scarce the last official data  from the us census bureau is that  million persons in the us are foreign born with  from latin america  from asia and  from europe foreignborn immigrants like to watch movies from their home countries   there are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming as an example in hawaii and southern california for instance surfing is quite popular and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest   what about ancillary markets   we plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible   what films do you have now in inventory   we presently have acquired the distribution rights to the following motion pictures  seducing spirits the perfect argument marina murders film struggle divorce in america a wonderful summer the truth about layla living with cancer the biggest fan days of redemption on borrowed time tumbleweed virus x farewell buddies and the pit  under the distribution agreements goliath will receive  of the gross revenues for each of the pictures we distribute in general our distribution contracts cover both domestic and international licensing agreements however for the picture the biggest fan we obtained limited distribution rights          how do these distribution rights work   we enter into a distribution agreement for each motion picture terms may be perpetual or limited by years the motion pictures that we are acquiring with the proceeds of this offering will have a term of five years we will generally obtain a fee of  to  of gross revenues licensing will be flexible for usage applications on a yearly or multiyear basis most markets especially foreign territories have a tendency to continuously renew content licensing   how many employees do you have do you have an office   we have just  employees and we believe that is sufficient during the development production and “content aggregation” phase of our development our administrative office is in marina del rey california   do you have a website   our website is wwwgoliathfilmandmediainternationalcom we have a mirror site at wwwgoliathfilmandmediacom   background   item a risk factors   risks related to our business   our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects and to make decisions based on of our historical performance   we have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our business on the basis of historical operations as a consequence it is difficult to forecast our future results based upon our historical data reliance on our historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales product costs or expenses if we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data we could be less profitable or incur losses which may result in a decline in our stock price   economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   the global economy is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented volatility we cannot predict when economic conditions will improve or stabilize a prolonged period of economic volatility or decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition andor exacerbate the other risks related to its business   our results of operations depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming that we distribute and underperformance at the box office or in television licensing of one or more motion pictures in any period can cause our results to be less than anticipated   our results of operations will depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming that we distribute which cannot be predicted with certainty in particular the underperformance at the box office of one or more motion pictures in any period may cause our revenue and earnings results for that period and potentially subsequent periods to be less than anticipated in some instances to a significant extent due to the difficulty of predicting our results of operations and the other factors it is difficult for industry or financial analysts to accurately forecast our results the trading market for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that such industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business if an analyst who covers us changes his or her financial estimates or investment recommendation or if our results of operations fall short of their estimates the price of our common shares could decline   our results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors   our results of operations will depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures or television content that we distribute which cannot be predicted with certainty accordingly our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods our results of operations also may fluctuate due to the timing mix number and availability of our theatrical motion picture and home entertainment releases as well as license periods for our content our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period or fiscal year due to differences in the number andor mix of films released compared to the corresponding period in the prior year or prior fiscal year our operating results also fluctuate due to our accounting practices which are standard for the industry which may cause us to recognize the production and marketing expenses in different periods than the recognition of related revenues which may occur in later periods for example in accordance with gaap and industry practice we are required to expense film advertising costs as incurred but are also required to recognize the revenue from any motion picture or television program over the entire revenue stream expected to be generated by the individual picture or television program          the comparability of our results may be affected by changes in accounting guidance or changes in our ownership of certain assets and businesses accordingly our results of operations from year to year may not be directly comparable to prior reporting periods   as a result of the foregoing and other factors our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period   our success depends on the ability of our senior management team as well as our ability to attract and retain key personnel   our success is highly dependent on the abilities of its management team the management team must be able to effectively work together to successfully conduct our current operations as well as implement our strategy which includes significant domestic expansion if we are unable to do so our results of operations and financial condition may suffer in addition as part of our strategy of international expansion there is intense competition for the services of qualified personnel the failure to retain current key managers or key members of the development production or marketing staff or to hire additional qualified personnel for new operations could be detrimental to our business   risks related to our securities   we may raise capital in future offerings    an offering might require the participation of institutional investors which are more likely to demand more stringent terms for any placement we have not determined the terms for any offering any future offering may be for common stock or may be for a security with rights superior to that of the common stock in connection with any offering we may be required to add investor’s representatives to the board of directors or may be required to commit to other conditions if other conditions are not met existing investors could have their rights or equity ownership substantially diluted we cannot at this time determine the terms of any followon offering or whether it will ever occur   we do not expect to pay dividends on our outstanding shares in the foreseeable future   we have not paid dividends in the past and do not have or anticipate having any funds for such purpose in the foreseeable future even if such funds become available we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future but instead will use all funds from operations for the continued development of the business   our common stock is quoted only on the otc bulletin board which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity   our common stock is quoted on the otc bulletin board the otc bulletin board is a significantly more limited market than the new york stock exchange or nasdaq system the quotation of our shares on the otc bulletin board may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a longterm adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future   because we became public by means of a “reverse merger” we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms   additional risks may exist since we became public through a “reverse merger” securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock we cannot assure you that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of us in the future   we cannot assure you that the common stock will become liquid or that it will be listed on a securities exchange   we would like to list our common stock on the nasdaq capital market as soon as practicable however we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or of any other stock exchange or that we will be able to maintain any such listing we are presently on the otc bulletin board thus investor liquidity may be limited          in the event we seek additional capital through equity or debt offerings our existing stockholders may be diluted or we may be unable to find additional capital on terms favorable to us and our stockholders   in the event that we need additional working capital for our projected operations we may seek capital through debt or equity offerings which could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock andor rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock those additional issuances of capital stock would result in a reduction of the percentage of ownership interest held by our existing stockholders also the addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or the registration of any other securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock finally we may not be able to find additional capital on terms favorable to us through existing markets or investors due to market conditions our historical performance or our stock price   there may be issuances of shares of preferred stock in the future   although we currently do not have preferred shares outstanding we could at some time in the future authorize preferred shares and the board of directors could complete the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation the right to receive dividends before dividends would be declared to common stockholders and the right to the redemption of such shares possibly together with a premium prior to the redemption of the common stock to the extent that we do issue preferred stock the rights of holders of common stock could be impaired thereby including without limitation with respect to liquidation   compliance with corporate governance and disclosure standards is costly   we have spent and continue to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure because we qualify as a smaller reporting company our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation

policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see note   summary of significant accounting policies   the following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting the company   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation   basis of presentation   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period actual results could differ from those estimates management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud the company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure among other items that  recorded transactions are valid  all valid transactions are recorded and  transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period a change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred the more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others estimated revenue of films the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions          actual results could differ from those estimates the company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented   revenue recognition   we will recognize revenues in accordance with asc  “entertainment films revenue recognition”   under asc  five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii the film is complete and has been delivered iii the license period has begun vi the price is fixed or determinable and v collection is reasonably assured the company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience considering economic and industry trends the company does not have any offbalance sheet exposure related to its customers   the company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all technical and document deliveries received waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s rights system   accounts receivable   accounts receivable if any are carried at the expected net realizable value the allowance for doubtful accounts when determined will be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables if there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults were higher than historical experience our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated which could have a negative impact on operations   the company currently does not have any accounts receivable the above accounting policies will be adopted upon the company carrying accounts receivable   intangible assets   the company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property principally motion pictures the company periodically reviews its long lived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value there was no amortization expense or impairment for the years ended april   and    income taxes   we account for income taxes under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” no  income taxes “asc ” under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled under asc  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   stock compensation   in accordance with asc no  compensation – stock compensation “asc ” we measure the compensation costs of sharebased compensation arrangements based on the grantdate fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services sharebased compensation arrangements include stock options restricted share plans performancebased awards share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans as such compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value such compensation amounts if any are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant we apply this statement prospectively equity instruments “instruments” issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments as required by asc  asc no  equity based payments to nonemployees “asc ” defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments in general the measurement date is a when a performance commitment as defined is reached or b when the earlier of i the nonemployee performance is complete or ii the instruments are vested the measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the asc           accounting for derivative financial instruments   we evaluate financial instruments using the guidance provided by asc  and apply the provisions thereof to the accounting of items identified as derivative financial instruments not indexed to our stock   fair value of financial instruments   we follow the provisions of asc  this topic defines fair value establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   we use fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock this primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value these require management’s judgment   fair value measurements   effective beginning second quarter  the fasb asc topic  financial instruments  requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports for the company this statement applies to certain investments and longterm debt also the fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements   various inputs are considered when determining the value of the company’s investments and longterm debt the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below   ● level  – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets     ● level  – other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates credit risk etc     ● level  – significant unobservable inputs including the company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments   the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared the company had no financial assets andor liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at april   assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature   the availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction for many financial instruments pricing inputs are readily observable in the market the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants and the valuation does not require significant management discretion for other financial instruments pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment as of april   the company had no assets other than prepaid expenses and capitalized film production costs   basic and diluted earnings per share   basic earnings per share are based on the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding diluted earnings per share is based on the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments   ● warrants     ● employee stock options and     ● other equity awards which include longterm incentive awards          the fasb asc topic  earnings per share  requires the company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution   diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as there were no potentially dilutive instruments for the years ended april   and    concentrations risks and uncertainties   the company did not have a concentration of business with suppliers or customers constituting greater than  of the company’s gross sales during  and    recent accounting pronouncements   we have evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have been issued and are not yet effective for us and determined that there are no such pronouncements expected to have an impact on our future financial statements   plan of operations   although the company had net income of  for the year ended april   the company had a net loss of  for the year ended april   these factors create substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s management plan to continue as a going concern revolves around its ability to execute its

standards codification “asc” no  income taxes “asc ” under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial

the company follows the provisions of asc  this topic defines fair value establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   the company uses fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock this primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value these require management’s judgment   fair value measurements   effective beginning second quarter  the fasb asc topic  financial instruments  requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports for the company this statement applies to certain investments and longterm debt also the fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements   various inputs are considered when determining the value of the company’s investments and longterm debt the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below   ● level  – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   ● level  – other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates credit risk etc   ● level  – significant unobservable inputs including the company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments   the company’s adoption of fasb asc topic  did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements   the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared the company had no financial assets andor liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at april   assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature   the availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction for many financial instruments pricing inputs are readily observable in the market the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants and the valuation does not require significant management discretion for other financial instruments pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment as of april   the company had no assets other than prepaid expenses and capitalized film production costs   basic and diluted earnings per share   basic earnings per share are based on the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding diluted earnings per share is based on the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments          goliath film and media holdings notes to financial statements for the years ended april   and      ● warrants         ● employee stock options and         ● other equity awards which include longterm incentive awards   the fasb asc topic  earnings per share  requires the company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution   diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as there were no potentially dilutive instruments for the years ended april   and    concentrations risks and uncertainties   the company did not have a concentration of business with suppliers or customers constituting greater than  of the company’s gross sales during  and    stock based compensation   in accordance with asc no  compensation – stock compensation “asc ” we measure the compensation costs of sharebased compensation arrangements based on the grantdate fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services sharebased compensation arrangements include stock options restricted share plans performancebased awards share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans as such compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value such compensation amounts if any are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant we apply this statement prospectively equity instruments “instruments” issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments as required by asc  asc no  equity based payments to nonemployees “asc ” defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments in general the measurement date is a when a performance commitment as defined is reached or b when the earlier of i the nonemployee performance is complete or ii the instruments are vested the measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the asc    accounting for derivative financial instruments   we evaluate financial instruments using the guidance provided by asc  and apply the provisions thereof to the accounting of items identified as derivative financial instruments not indexed to our stock   recently enacted accounting standards   the company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements   note  – common

concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have significant cash or other current assets nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   during the next year the company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital   historically the company has relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the company’s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon its and its shareholders   in the past year the company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock for the coming year the company plans to continue to fund the company through debt and securities sales and issuances focus on a possible joint venture or merger until the company generates revenues through the operations of such merged company or joint venture as stated above   note   related party
