tremendously devoted group of people wwwdierenambulancegroningennl share author arturo fernandez posted jun nd  tags customer experience expertise industrytailored transcom’s industrytailored cx expertise the world of customer care is currently going through a period of radical transformation and like in many other areas the drivers of change are digitalization and the everpresent ambition to always offer the best possible customer experience it should however be pointed out that these developments are not affecting all product categories in exactly the same way as a result we have to take the distinctive features of each industrial sector into consideration when defining a successful customer care strategy but this is by no means a new need a specialized approach has always been necessary but perhaps customer care now has to demonstrate that it is more dynamic and flexible because consumers are becoming increasingly demanding and the service they receive from businesses represents a key differentiating factor now more than ever many characteristics need to be identified and calibrated for each individual sector in order to define optimum customer care processes which services to automate and which to continue to assign to “human” operators what mix of contact channels to provide how and when to engage in crossselling and retention activities during the customer’s lifecycle what requirements to adopt in terms of service levels without forgetting the various profiles and training needs for agents in order to deliver the best possible customer experience over the years transcom has gained significant experience in multiple industry sectors and knows how to devise and finetune the most effective mix of services to support its clients as they tackle the challenges in the global marketplace we know for example that in ecommerce it is essential to offer solid reliable customer care services to manage payments and logisticsrelated issues these services must also be provided over nonvoice channels like private messaging which is becoming increasingly important when compared to traditional channels in the banking sector which is typically less aggressive in its use of contact centers for sales we work with our clients to transform inbound customer care services into contact opportunities to promote crossselling and upselling we know how to provide exceptional firstlevel technical support to the manufacturers of electronic goods and household appliances and we help them reduce their warranty costs likewise for our clients in the telecommunications sector we have equipped ourselves with mobile phone emulators so that we can provide assistance for hundreds of different devices these are just a few examples of how transcom supports its partners with industrytailored solutions here at transcom we have always regarded this industryspecific approach as a fundamental and central part of a strategy that basically leverages two main factors sharing the best practices we offer our clients worldwide through our global “one transcom” platform the organisation of our areas of expertise into industry practice groups with the main aim of developing a range of specific services for each sector that responds to the challenges faced by our clients these global initiatives combined with the support and guidance of our clients allow us to continue to be the partner of choice to manage customer care in diverse industry sectors share author cheryll aganda posted jun th  tags customer experience digital customer care multichannel transcom value proposition transcom’s value proposition at transcom we take pride in our ability to deliver outstanding customer experience our work to continuously develop and refine our value proposition builds on three major elements that best describe our organizational capabilities  customer experience management  digitalization  multichannel  world class contact center our customer experience management efforts are heavily focused on our ability to make our partners’ and our partners’ customers’ journeys not only enjoyable but more importantly effortless within this area transcom delivers a number of services that are geared towards the fulfillment and delivery of an outstanding experience all aspects of our offering are related to our ability to answer the questions “how can we assist you at key customer touch points and how can we make your journey to resolution as effortless as possible” in the digitalization and multichannel area we offer our clients insights and recommendations on how to transform and adapt their customer care operations to the rapid growth in digital customer interactions together with our clients we devise multichannel solutions that support a seamless customer journey we continue to increase our delivery of services via digital channels with nonvoice interactions accounting for approximately  of revenue in  within the world class contact center element our work is focused on moving transcom to the next level of service evolving from being an outsourcing partner to becoming a true transformation partner our industry is changing rapidly with live contacts becoming more and more complex the ability to add value and offer customers proactive advice will increase in importance and many companies will put more emphasis on upselling and crossselling this is putting pressure on current business models eg in terms of recruitment staff engagement and price models a world class contact center needs to create an environment that brings together solutions process changes and technology with people this is why many of our initiatives in this area are  focused on people engagement process maturity and technology we truly believe that these three pillars all work together in adding value to our service offerings in further enhancing our ability to deliver outstanding performance and in building stronger relationships with our partners share author alina andriatyte posted jun th  tags csr employee experience transcom lithuania transcom region north europe adventure of a lifetime exchanged minsk for vilnius the first thing that wowed karyna about vilnius  when she first arrived from minsk was its narrow streets which looked like they were the guardians of hundredyearold secrets and the general atmosphere shrouding the entire city she liked the university where she had decided to study law from the very first day too naturally the fact that her native city of minsk was just a few hours away by train also helped her to make this decision today karyna is happy that she decided to settle in a foreign country and tells us how she went about starting her life here what is surprising about lithuanians and what belarus could learn from its neighbour photo from karyna’s personal archive a piece of her homeland in lithuania karyna’s decision to study in lithuania was determined by the fact that the european humanities university of belarus was in vilnius – the same university that was previously located in minsk however due to restrictions of its academic freedom the university decided to relocate to lithuania “i left minsk when i was only seventeen although i wanted to study abroad i did not want to go very far away so vilnius was the perfect choice i liked the idea that i would be able to live in one of the oldest european cities and would have the opportunity to familiarise myself with the common history of lithuania and belarus after all some time ago we were one country” says karyna foreign language – key to finding a job when she was still in school karyna tried several jobs she sewed toys worked as a waitress and even worked as a courier karyna who started her master’s studies this year was finally able to start looking for a job in lithuania seeing that at long last she has some free time however the search was not easy “i was searching for a job with a lot of conditions of my own firstly i do not speak lithuanian secondly i am a student and cannot work fulltime foreigners often get jobs in positions where a foreign language other than english is needed those coming from other countries can look for jobs where their native language is required but this didn’t apply to me in the lithuanian labour market there is no shortage of belarussian or russianspeakers i was saved by my knowledge of german” she says she speaks german and has spent a year in germany where she learnt about the culture of the country according to karyna it was the language and experience abroad which particularly helped her to stand out from other candidates she is now working for an international company transcom worldwide vilnius which provides contact centre services karyna says that she has found her favourite job and the staff are like her family “i did not want to neglect my studies and i was fortunate to land a job where i could have a flexible schedule furthermore the company’s internal culture and attitude to employees are a great incentive for students for example it is always possible to have a day off for examinations or other studyrelated commitments another fear of mine was that i might feel isolated and different from the rest of the staff i only speak a few words of lithuanian and my work colleagues here do not speak russian although we all speak english for some reason i thought that it would be difficult to communicate as it turned out i could not have been more wrong – today these people are my friends they are always there to help and give advice” says karyna would miss the neverending festivals and the mount of gediminas although karyna herself does not have much experience of this kind of work she says that she rarely hears her friends and acquaintances talking of such a fun and exciting working culture and atmosphere as the one she is working in when asked about the main differences between lithuania and belarus she says that she was particularly surprised by the interactions between work colleagues “i was very pleasantly surprised in lithuania it is customary to celebrate your birthday christmas or valentine’s day with colleagues on international women’s day colleagues spoiled us with coffee and muffins and good wishes in belarus events such as these are not celebrated at work and colleagues rarely congratulate each other on their birthdays” said karyna besides her work colleagues karyna says she would miss the mount of gediminas the most were she to leave lithuania this site rarely visited by vilnius locals holds a particular fascination for her “this is a romantic place where i come to admire the whole city and to watch planes landing this scenery opens up in the evening when the lights are switched on unfortunately access to the castle was limited in winter and this was yet another reason to wait for the spring” karyna says of her favourite spot in the city when asked what advice she would give to any of her countrymen coming to lithuania karyna said she has noticed that belarusians mostly come to buy things rather than to sightsee and gain new experiences “i realise why people do this –most of the goods people buy in lithuania cost substantially more in belarus or are not available at all however i would strongly advise them to spend more time on leisure and seeing lithuania which indeed has many things to show” concludes karyna this article was originally published at delfilt share author robert gati posted may th  tags award telecom transcom norway
