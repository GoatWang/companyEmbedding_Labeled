of investments of sri lanka ms nancy kupfer  vice president and senior counsel  marriott international inc and ms sahiba chait  counsel marriott international inc inset ongoing construction east west properties plc owned by businessman nahil wijesuriya has signed a hotel management agreement with marriott international hotel chain to manage the company’s rs  billion hotel in weligama which will eventually go public officials said  mr wijesuriya chairman east west properties plc told the business times that weligama hotel properties ltd a fully owned subsidiary of east west properties plc began construction of its first resort hotel marriot weligama resort and spa in weligama bay in march this year and that it will open under the brand category of marriott hotels and resorts in march  this contract was signed about two weeks ago by vijitha wijesuriya managing director east west properties plc and anika wijesuriya director east west properties plc for weligama hotel properties ltd and kiran andicot vice president hotel development india and subcontinent marriott international inc he said weligama hotel properties ltd will go public in due course “this would be the country’s tallest resort hotel to date with  floors being managed by one of the most globally renowned brands” he added noting that it’s the tallest building outside colombo mr wijesuriya said that choosing weligama located  kilometers from colombo to construct this resort hotel was because it is a popular tourist destination renowned for its sandy stretch of beaches he said that the room rate of this room hotel would be around us  he said that meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions mice are a potential area they’re targeting for the resort “we have a  square feet ballroom and we plan to have india as a feeder market in terms of mice” he added mr wijesuriya said that originally this hotel was slated to be under marriott hotels’ ‘courtyard’ brand which is placed at slightly lower echelon in their brands but it ended up in marriott hotels and resorts which is a higher brand category as they were aiming for ‘higher standards’ with the hotel project “the ritzcarlton and the marriott hotels  resorts are their highest brands and the rest – renaissance hotels  resorts edition hotels autograph collection courtyard ac hotels by marriott residence inn etc comes thereafter” he explained adding that as they kept on pushing for higher standards the project faced a brand creep which is a situation where one generally smaller brand graduates to a higher brand in the same family “for example the ordinary room size wasn’t right so we went for a bigger size” he explained adding that ultimately the standards specified for marriott’s courtyard brand were surpassed and they managed to touch marriott hotels and resorts brand which i marriott international’s signature and most widely distributed brand “earlier marriott had a franchise with the galadari hotel where they lent their name which entails yearly site inspections” mr wijesuriya explained noting that what they signed is a management contract where marriott international will manage the property according to marriott standards he added that this project is ahead of its schedule and within the budget he also said that a team from marriott will train their staff periodically he noted that sri lanka is becoming too costly as a destination “the minimum room rates in colombo guarantee that we’ll be expensive” he noted highlighting that it’s important to create a destination and that sri lanka needs to be conscious of the regional pricing “one of the reasons we sold intercontinental was because of the minimum room charges” he said the company is planning to construct more worldclass hotels and resorts in colombo kandy hambantota and trincomalee as well as in the cultural triangle in the near future marriott international currently operates over  hotels in over  countries and territories
