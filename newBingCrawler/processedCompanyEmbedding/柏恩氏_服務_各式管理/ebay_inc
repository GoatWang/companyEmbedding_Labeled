prohibited or restricted in some manner biddingedit auctionstyle listingsedit bidding on ebay old or news auctionstyle listing is called proxy bidding and is essentially equivalent to a vickrey auction sealedbid with the following exceptions the winning bidder pays the secondhighest bid plus one bid increment amount that is some small predefined amount relative to the bid size instead of simply the highest bid however since the bid increment amounts are relatively insignificant compared to the bid size they are not considered from a strategic standpoint the highest bidders bid is sealed as in a vickrey auction but the current winning bid second highest plus one increment is displayed throughout the auction to allow price discovery because ebays auctionstyle listings are sealedbid it is usually to all bidders advantage that bids are made only at the very end of the auction early bids will not always increase the bidders chance of winning the auction and will often raise the items final price winning bid for the winner ebay also allows sellers to offer a buy it now price that will end the auction immediately the buy it now price is available until someone bids on the item or until the reserve price is met when the buy it now option disappears the auctionstyle listing proceeds normally seller ratingsedit in  ebay implemented a system of seller ratings with four categories buyers are asked to rate the seller in each of these categories with a score of one to five with five being the highest rating unlike the overall feedback rating these ratings are anonymous neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller the listings of sellers with a rating of  or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower in search results power sellers are required to have scores in each category above  in a reversal of roles on january   auctionbytescom held an open survey in which sellers could rate ebay as well as competing

even realize this one seller said it must have been something i did as she said she definitely did not and would not sign up for it i suspect she clicked the i accept button having no idea and by the

a dream come true at first the trainers did what was expected of them which was make this job seem like its the best job you will ever have and they love working for this company i of course got sucked into this dream and it did seem like this was going to be a career instead of a job once you got out on the floor that immediately changed they want you to know everything and even if you know everything it will change every week i can understand change but every company needs consistency as well your customers arent going to have faith in you if they call often and then get told something different every week then we get the back lash and cursed out management is ok have had worse can be understanding co workers are usually great the company has great benefits and they start first day you work no waiting awesome also free snacks sodas juice starbucks coffee cereal oatmeal etc gym on site with free membership parking sucks if you get there later in the day this job will suck the life out of you if you are an emotional sympathetic person people cuss you out on the daily or will want to talk to your ear off about why they are entitled to whatever they want at the moment so to
