which originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment in  chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the  desktop copier the xerox edit main article xerox  the company came to prominence in  with the introduction of the xerox  the most successful single product of all time the  the first plain paper photocopier was developed by carlson and john h dessauer it was so popular that by the end of  xerox had almost  million in revenue the product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button  simplicity would become the foundation of future xerox products and user interfaces revenues leaped to over  million by  sedit the company expanded substantially throughout the s making millionaires of some longsuffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product in  a xerography research facility called the wilson center for research and technology was opened in webster new york in  the company changed its name to xerox

carlsons vision of a copier that could fit on anyones office desk ten years later in  a basic analogue color copier based on the  followed the  itself was gradually sped up to become the  and  the  was similarly developed into the  and  products and eventually also the  desktop microfiche printer xeroxs first foray into duplicating as distinct from copying was with the xerox  introduced in  the model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour although not as fast as offset printing this machine introduced the industrys first automatic document feeder paper slitter and perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in  many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to todays fax machines the fax operation in todays multifunction copiers is true to carlsons original vision for these devices in  c peter mccolough a longtime executive of haloid and xerox became xeroxs ceo the same year the company consolidated its headquarters at xerox square in downtown rochester new york with its

save decades of manual copying before it was aired there was some concern that the commercial would be denounced as blasphemous however when the commercial was screened for the archbishop of new york he found it amusing and gave it his blessing dominic portrayed by jack eagle became the face of xerox into the scitation needed following these years of record profits in  xerox resolved an antitrust suit with the united states federal trade commission ftc which at the time was under the direction of frederic m scherer the xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the companys

supply maintenance configuration and user support in  xerox moved its european research center in inovallée near grenoble to reinforce this image in  the company introduced a corporate signature the

modifying a xerox  copier xerox management was afraid the product version of starkweathers invention which became the  would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until ibm launched the  laser printer in  the first commercial nonimpact printer was the xerox  introduced in  based on the  copier it had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer phil chen in  following ibms laser printer introduction the xerox  was introduced laser printing eventually became a multibilliondollar business for xerox in the late s xerox introduced the xerox  color slide system this product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic mm slides many of the concepts used in todays photo shop programs were pioneered with this technology in  xerox announced the forward looking  laser printing system a much smaller version of their  but with revolutionary touch screen capabilities and multiple media input word processing disks ibm magcards etc and printer finishing options this product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost but rather to show the innovation of xerox it did take off with many customers but was soon replaced with its still smaller and lower cost  distributed electronic printer offering in  palo alto research centeredit main article xerox parc the xerox alto workstation was developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have cost  in the mids apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reachedcitation needed apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in  and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse among the

commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in

and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement

make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of use evident  but as of  most indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying see
