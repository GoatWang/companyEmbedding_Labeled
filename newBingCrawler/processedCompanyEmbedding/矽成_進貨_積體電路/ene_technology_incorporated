mplab® x integrated development environment ide mplab x ide is a software program that runs on a pc windows® mac os® linux® to develop applications for microchip microcontrollers and digital signal controllers it is called an integrated development environment ide because it provides a single integrated environment to develop code for embedded microcontrollers mplab x integrated development environment brings many changes to the pic® microcontroller development tool chain unlike previous versions of the mplab ide which were developed completely inhouse mplab x ide is based on the open source netbeans ide from oracle taking this path has allowed us to add many frequently requested features very quickly and easily while also providing us with a much more extensible architecture to bring you even more new features in the future  want mplab® x ide on the go meet the cloud based mplab® xpress ide the award winning mplab® development environment is now more portable than ever simply navigate to mplabxpressmicrochipcom from any compatible internet browser and enjoy the streamlined mplab xpress ide without any downloads or installation more information tabs  mplab® x features downloads documentation webinars features extended mplab® x ide supports oneclick one click make program debug  execute operation unlike other ides where you build have to connect to the hardware tool program the target and then start your debug session under mplab x it is all compiled into one action button run program or debug run starts ‘make’ which will check for changes and build any relevant updates connect to the tool program the images and either start a debug session or start an execution of the programmed image there is also the option of doing these individually if the customer prefers provides a new call graph for navigating complex codes in order to navigate your code or understand a colleague’s code in addition to documentation the call graph provides a static call tree of all functions called from other functions it can also be exported to a portable network graphics png image supports multiple configurations within your projects a single project can now build the same set of source files in many different ways each “configuration” has its own compiler options compiler hardware tool and target device supports multiple versions of the same compiler you can have as many versions of a compiler installed as you wish to work with each is identified by its own version for any project you can select the specific version of your choice this enables you to use more than one instance of a compiler within the ide at the same time project configurations can be set to use an older version while trying a new release support for multiple debug tools of the same type mplab x ide now allows you to have multiple debug tools connected to the computer at the same time you can select which ever tool you desire for a specific project or configuration within a project example programmer and simulator in their own configurations it provides the ability to debug more than one target at the same time using just one installation of mplab x ide supports live parsing live parsing means while you type in code if you enter something the c parser does not recognize it will flag it many times this allows you to fix code before even compiling import existing mplab  ide projects and use either ide for the same source you can import an existing mplab  project and develop the code from within either ide the same compiler and same debug tools are used so the code is still as production worthy as always this flexibility allows you to use the mplab® x ide without affecting your mplab  project supports hyperlinks for fast navigation to declarations and includes using the ctrl key and mouse over a function variable macro or include statement allows you to view its declaration clicking on the hyperlink will take you right to the source of declaration alternatively you can right click on it and choose navigate → go to declaration from the context menu to jump to its declaration supports live code templates within the ide there are many existing code templates that can be accessed using a couple of letters then tab or specified key you can create your own templates even live templates such that when you enter values into the template area other areas of code are also populated for example the func active code template shown here as you enter parameters in the comments to document the function the real function is also populated supports the ability to enter file code templates with license headers or template code the developer can select from a template file whenever he creates a new file to add source code to mplab x ide can track changes within your own system using local history unsure of what changes you made to the software since the last version control update use the local history utility to visualize changes made very useful for backtracking within mplab® x ide a user can configure their own code format style either an individual or a company can set up a code format standard to be used within the editor just select the file to format the code in and menu sourceformat to reapply the template to your source code provides a tasks window which is a great way to keep track of those loose ends in your code the tasks operation automatically scans your code and lists commented lines containing words such as todo or fixme the words can be customized under options tasks provide a convenient way to keep track of important items you feel need addressing shows macro expansions macros are incredible useful but sometimes they can have unexpected values if they are conditionally defined this window allows you to see what the compiler will consume after the preprocessor is done with the expansion view you see exactly what value they expand to also blocks of code not to be compiled are omitted in the view also in the editor window mplab x shows you all the ifdefendif blocks it uses the comment color grey by default to show you sections that will not be included now supports configurable memory views you can change any memory view to look at any type of memory formats for those views are also selectable from the dropdowns this allows a quick view change without going thru the menus has a new project status window need one place to summarize you project for convenience there is a single window that gathers all the relevant project information and its environment device name debug tool language build tool and connection state are presented the memory section shows total used and reserved by debug tool for ram and flash memory checksum and breakpoint silicon resource status is also shown the debug tool provides additional status for device id firmware versions and voltages allows you to attach a specific debugger tool firmware version to a project with this feature you’ll never have to worry about which firmware version you were using mplab will remember it and automatically restore it to the correct version when you connect to the debugger just set it and forget it now has two types of disassembly windows available only during a debug session and accessed through the window debugging menu this new disassembly window shows the disassembled memory of the highlevel language function in the scope of the current execution point of the debugger it is extremely useful for debugging program execution at the assembly level in addition is the disassembly listing window which is similar to the one provided in mplab ide vx it is available under the window output menu this window shows the disassembled code generated by the compiler for the current project it interleaves the disassembled code with the original highlevel language source code so it is possible to see what the compiler generates for each line of source code in the project a project must be built with debugging information since the display depends upon the debugging line table within the built project in order to display data provides a software call stack window with function arguments use the variables and call stack windows together to browse local variable history of each function in the call chain hint the variables window is docked at the bottom of the output pane to allow simultaneous interaction and display of the local variables with the selected function in the call stack window provides focused modes of the variables display the variables window configured to show only variables used near the program counter location cursor position in this mode note that global variables used in the scope of the function can be displayed as well as local variables variables window with display mode configured to show all variables defined in the scope of a function where the program counter is currently located notice that the two globally defined variables are excluded from the list in this mode provides autocompletion save time entering programs and ensure correctness using the mplab®x editor’s autocompletion features provides source code control built in there are three flavors of configuration management source control already built into the new ide in addition others are provided through the netbeans community provides a navigation window which allows fast easy access to code save time navigating to particular locations in large code bases using the navigation window use the context menu to filter out undesired types supports a fully customizable workspace and multiple screen support you can customize the actions in the toolbars minimize the windows to have them on side bars which will pop out undock any editor tab by dragging and dropping it outside the ide this will turn into an independent window that will allow moving onto a second screen extend the ide functionality with the mplab® ide plugin manager you can use the plugin manager from the tools menu to add remove or update sets of features for embedded programming including a wide variety of netbeans plugins change case rectangular edit tools adobe reader clear case revision
