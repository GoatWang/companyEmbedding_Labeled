needs of a wide range of applications including cellular g base stations communications systems microwave rfif catv test and measurement and industrial industryleading rf innovations glitchfree™ technology idt’s digital step attenuators dsa virtually eliminate transient overshoot that occurs during msb attenuation state transi­tions of standard dsas with glitchfree technology amplifier damage and loss of information at the adc are avoided flatnoise™ technology idt’s variable gain amplifier vga noise figure is kept virtually flat in the criti­cal region while gain is reduced this greatly eases design constraints for radio engineers by enhancing signaltonoise ratio snr zerodistortion™ technology idt’s rf mixers improve snr by reducing the noise floor and third order intermodulation distortion this is important for crowded spectrum envi­ronments as it enhances qualityofservice qos and frees up underutilized spectrum kz constant impedance technology idt’s rf switches maintain nearly constant impedance when switching between rf ports by controlling the impedance during the switching process voltage standing wave ratio vswr transients are minimized this improves switch reliability reduces voltage stresses on downstream components and improves overall system performance klin constant linearity technology idt’s variable gain amplifiers maintain constant high linearity as gain is adjusted as the gain is reduced the linearity oip remains constant in the critical region this prevents in­termodulation distortion from degrading as the gain is reduced parametric product
