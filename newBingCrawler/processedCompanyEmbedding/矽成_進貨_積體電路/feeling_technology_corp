smartburner™ is a new state‐of‐the art consumer version of the highly praised commercial product safetelement learn more safe t sensor™ is engineered to help prevent microwave fires and nuisancefalse alarms saving lives preventing injury and saving money learn more rangeminder™ is a new consumer product that helps prevent unattended cooking on gas ceramic and electric coil stovetops learn more what people are saying about our products we will specify safe t element for all future projects to help provide a higher level of fire safety in the communities we manage we would definitely recommend this to all housing authorities to help protect residents and properties from the dangerous risk of cooking fires this technology does everything that it says it does and we are very pleased with the results on  occasions a tenant has put things on her stove and fallen asleep the good news is that while the food burnt no fire started due to the new safe t element without reservation i strongly recommend the use of safe t elements for fire‐prevention in multi‐family developments the safe t elements have lowered our electrical consumption and… will pay for themselves in  or  years we would most definitely recommend this product to other housing authorities or apartment complexes norstar is using a product called safe t element… and has been extremely pleased with the results… this technology allows food to cook like always yet helps prevent a fire from happening in the first place we installed  stes in  of our highest risk senior’s buildings this product did exactly what it claimed to do and we are now taking active steps to expand the use of this technology in the tampa housing authority properties “this installation and safety initiative is proving to be a great benefit to protecting the people and property at rha we would definetly recommend this technology to all housing authorities to help protect residents and properties from the dangerous risks of cooking fires” the north charleston housing authority has installed the safe t elements in all of its housing units since  since the installation we have not had one grease fire without doubt this product has proven itself to be an excellent fire prevention device “since safe t element was installed we have more confidence of the level of fire safety in our group homes and have not experienced a single unattended cooking fire related incident” the latest what is rangeminder the firefighter’s friend view all resources featured video robert scully interview with ceo kevin callahan view all
