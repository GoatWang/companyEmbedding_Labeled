leverage both cevas leading gps technology competency and customer base and rfdomuss advanced rf technology to exploit opportunities in the gps market ceva believes that the increased use of gps technology in personal navigation devices pnd and cellular handsets has been largely driven by the development of lowcost highlyintegrated gps chipsets this growth has not been reflected in licensing revenues of gps technologies which represents the primary focus of cevas ip intellectual property business in the past few months we analyzed the future market trends for gps technology our research indicated that although the gps chipset market is growing the gps ip licensing market will develop at a slower pace than we had anticipated said gideon wertheizer ceo of ceva the transaction announced

the investment in glonav will be recorded as a financial asset the resulting gain from divestment of cevas gps technology and associated product line offset by impairment of gps assets and goodwill as
