growth macrosummaryinphi a leader in the highspeed analog semiconductor segment is currently undervalued due to market overreaction to temporary chinese demand pausethis presents an opportunistic trading window prior to the second quarter earnings announcement inphis product portfolio breadth and differentiation coupled with early indicators of demand recovery in phase  of china’s infrastructure build support  upside at a  price target within  monthsthe following table summarizes the price target analysis and upside potential based on metrics and methods outlined in the valuation section market setup in may  inphi nyse iphi reported  qoq and  yoy revenue growth from continuing operations for q its quarterly eps of  was in line with consensus nonetheless management guided down  for the second quarter on signs of demand softness in china as a result inphis share price has retreated as much as  investment thesis  the sector demand for highspeed semiconductor optical components is fundamentally intact  the market overreacted to the temporary pause in china the company’s outlook remains positive and i believe the current softness in demand is temporary for the following reasons  china optical rollout cycle – takeaways from the ofc conference highlight that china mobile chl will increase investment in transport networks this year even as it plans to reduce overall capital expenditures in one example jeffrey gao huawei’s president of transmission product line estimates that fy coherent optical port shipments to china’s network operators would increase plus yoy despite the q slowdown this should benefit inphi given its competitive edge in coherent technology and existing relationships in asia fundamentally the q volume decline in china was driven by two main factors a network providers’ inventory accumulation particularly at huawei and zte and b the pause in phase  of china’s provincial metro optical rollouts note phase  extends the national backbone connecting the four largest cities in china there are positive indications going forward on both factors  inventory workdown at huawei – based on latest discussions the inventory workdown is likely to complete midway through h resulting in an acceleration in orders later in the year specifically for inphi’s longhaul and metro deployment products inphi estimates the inventory burn period at huawei to have an approximately m impact to revenue in q a third of that amount is expected to be recovered in q in terms of product lines g dco demand will likely recover earlier in the second half of the year considering huawei is accelerating shipments of g dcos  china backbone and metro interconnect ramp – there are three factors that support acceleration of revenue growth in h a renewal of phase  buildout efforts in the second half of  b commencement of phase  in qq and c q network maintenance orders from existing customers  north america optical upgrade cycle – verizon vz and att t have announced intentions for gg and gg longhaul metro deployments respectively this will likely increase demand for cfp aco transceivers and amplifiers inphi’s well received cfpaco product sampling indicated growth potential in this category inphi is also positioned to benefit from data center pam adoption in na  inphi is a highquality player with a firstmover advantage and a broad product portfolio  high potential to crosssell given the breadth inphis product portfolio and its capabilities to innovate – inphi’s ability to offer silicon photonics linear tia and coherent dsp sets it apart from the competition this broad product lineup allows bundling opportunities not available to other players for example inphi can crosssell its linear tia and linear driver to customers adopting its pam solutions growing revenue and share of wallet in the process  the shift from limiting to linear likely to benefit inphi – inphi’s investment in linear technology for its drivers is beginning to pay off linear drivers allow for higher modulation than limiting drivers accelerating inphi’s market share gain in the longhaul and metro markets the shift is also starting to take place in the data center market with the transition to g and g inphi will be able to capitalize on its leadership in linear to capture additional dci market share  positive outlook on colorz adoption and production capacity expansion – colorz is the industry’s only g pam subkm qsfp solution for data center interconnect delivering up to tbs of bandwidth over a single fiber colorz was ahead of plan in q with a revenue of approximately m projected double to m in the second quarter after microsoft began colorz deployment a second large data center player initiated deployment validation a third and a fourth customer have also expressed interest and could ramp early next year  the second generation of colorz is under development – a g subkm dci interconnect solution is currently under development and inphi plans a release date in  even though acacia acia and broadcom avgo are likely to introduce competing solutions in that timeframe inphi will benefit from its market leadership and existing relationships  capacity constraint alleviation – inphi has worked to resolve a colorz capacity constraint with a key manufacturing partner the company has also added testing capacity to remove a bottleneck and has plans to add even more in the second half of the year to meet demand  differentiated lowpower coherent dci solution – inphi acquired clariphy to add coherent technology to its product portfolio and the acquisition is starting to have a larger and more meaningful impact clariphy is sampling its new asic targeting metro customers in the second quarter and will release longhaul and dci products in  given the competitive advantages of this lowpower solution clariphy may exceed the expectations of mm in  and mm in  company overview  inphi provides highspeed analog semiconductor solutions to the longhaul data center interconnect and intradata center communications markets the company was incorporated in  and is headquartered in sunnyvale california it sells directly to oems primarily in the networking market and indirectly to oems through module manufacturers subsystem providers and original design manufacturers “odms” inphi divested its memory business in august  and through the acquisitions of cortina highspeed interconnect and optical transport and clariphy ultrahighspeed systems on a chip focused on data movement interconnect inphi operates a fabless business model and competes with large international semiconductor companies as well as specialized analog signal processing companies ford tamer ceo john edmunds cfo and loi nguyen founder and svp lead a team of executives with years of experience in the fiber optics industry products – the company has one of the most comprehensive solutions platforms across the three optical market segments – longhaul metro and data centers broadly products categories include differential and transimpedance amplifiers demultiplexers differential encoders modulator drivers and logic gates the current product lineup delivers speeds up to  gbps with nextgen products intended for speeds up to  gbps longhaul and metro – this category spans longdistance transimpedance amplifiers and modulator drivers otn processors and coherent dsp including inphi’s bestselling product sales of the transimpedance amplifier with product number intasod comprised   and  of total revenue in   and  respectively  between data centers – colorz is inphi’s flagship product for communication between data centers  inside data centers – inphi’s products enabling connections inside data centers include shortdistance transimpedance amplifiers and modulator drivers physical layer devices physerdes and pulse amplitude modulators pam enabling g deployments inside data centers revenue streams – cortina contributes m of revenue per year approximately  of projected total revenue and clariphy is expected to contribute m approximately  of projected total revenue in  and m approximately  of projected total revenue in  margins – nongaap q gross margins declined to  from  a year ago due to significant increase in packaged linear drivers which have lower margin relative to other products clariphy sales particularly those incorporating coherent dsp are associated with margins in the plus range and are expected to ramp up in the second half of the year likely resulting in margin expansion revenue geographic segmentation – about  of inphi’s revenue is generated in asia exposure to china has grown with huawei and cisco accounting for  of total revenue last year the chinese networking market grew by  yoy with  of that gain benefiting huawei and hc figure  was developed based on an analysis of inphis financial disclosures in its latest k report risks there are market dynamics and product portfolio risks associated with the investment thesis these potential risks require further data points to validate and include ciena’s cien entry into the merchant optical chip market through partnerships and licenses benefiting inphi’s competitors lumentum lite oclaro oclr and neophotonics nptn before the first half of  limited or slow adoption of colorz for data center interconnect failure to address capacity constraints with manufacturing and testing partners further delay in phase  of china’s provincial optical network extension rollout limited or slow adoption of clariphy coherent dsp products valuation – the valuation is based on an equal weighting of the bull base and bear case blended fyfy eps at x x and x pe respectively the selected xx pe multiples are at the higher end of the range of peer multiples and are reflective of inphi’s fyfy eps cagr market leadership  overall growth expectations the bull case assumes gross margins in line with historical actuals which i believe is conservative given the margin expansion option of the clariphy product portfolio the base case assumes a bps gross margin contraction relative to actuals in  the bear case assumes a bps and bps gross margin contraction yoy in  and  respectively exhibits the model was developed based on an analysis of inphis financial statements and disclosures including the management discussion during inphis

commercial g product capabilities for optical communications monday th october  source inphi corporation new optical components company to develop and sell highspeed indium phosphide chipsets at  gbps  gbps and beyond westlake village ca inphi corporation an emerging optical components company today announced it has successfully developed and tested the world s first commercial indium phosphide inp integrated circuits capable of network performance levels higher than  gbps this product will position inphi to deliver the industry s highest bandwidth lowest power oc solutions and ultimately enable network service providers to offer customers the fastest fiber optic network transmission speeds available to date inphi s highspeed integrated circuits demonstrate significantly superior performance at oc levels and reinforce the value of inp as the leading technology for use in optical applications unlike more traditional materials such as silicon germanium sige and gallium arsenide gaas which are used in  gbps designs inp today is able to meet higher throughput demands of   and  gbps in a very short period since the availability of our gcs inp hbt technology inphi has been able to achieve first pass success inphi s modeling and design methodology yields circuits that maximize the performance of the gcs carbondoped indium phosphide process technology explained chanh nguyen cto of global communication semiconductors the inphi circuits are the most complex we have seen to date these circuits are inphi s first  multiplexer and  demultiplexer prototypes and operate at a data rate greater than  gbps with a power consumption of less than  milliwatts this breakthrough development will enable optical equipment vendors to build transponder modules highend routers and dwdm transport systems with oc interfaces at power levels comparable to those of oc ports with their revolutionary indium phosphide design technology inphi is poised to lead the emerging oc optical communications component industry stated dado banatao managing partner of tallwood venture capital and chairman of the board at inphi inphi delivers the industry s highest bandwidth components for multiple market segments network service providers have been clamoring for this level of performance for some time and now we can give it to them adoption of  gbps line rates will be paced by the industry s ability to solve several technical problems and address the dearth of components from fiber to framers said allan armstrong director of optical transport semiconductors at rhk inphi s multiplexer and demultiplexer prototypes represent a significant step forward in indium phosphide technology about inphi based in westlake village california inphi corporation was formed in november  and is an emerging privately held venturefunded company in the optical communications industry inphi delivers the highest bandwidth lowest power indium phosphide integrated circuits to optical communications suppliers who need
