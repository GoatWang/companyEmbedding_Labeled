interface spi densities from kbit to mbit small erasable sectors and the industrys highest performance the wx family supports dualspi effectively doubling standard spi clock rates the wq family is a superset of the x family with dualio and quadio spi for even higher performance clock rates up to mhz achieve an equivalent of mhz mbytes transfer rate when using quadspi this is more than eight times the performance of ordinary serial flash mhz and even surpasses asynchronous parallel flash memories while using fewer pins and less space faster transfer rates mean controllers can execute code xip directly from the spi interface or further improve boot time when shadowing code to ram additionally some spiflash devices offer the new quad peripheral interface qpi supporting true quad commands for improved xip performance and simpler controller circuitry additionally new ultrasmall form factor packages are ideal for space constrained mobile and handheld applications leading the serial flash
