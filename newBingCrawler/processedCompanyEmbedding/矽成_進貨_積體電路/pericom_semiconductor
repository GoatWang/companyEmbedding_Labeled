objects and relationships including pericom’s many thousands of products and product options to help visitors find the products they were looking for we built a customizable faceted filter system for the product family pages using ractivejs preloading the products and doing all the filtering with javascript means the filtering is instant with no page refreshing fully responsive design pericom’s customers are extremely techsavvy hardware engineers so the site needed to be responsive through and through all aspects of the site were designed to work on touch and mobile devices first then enhanced to take advantage of larger viewports and other input tools when available advanced multicontenttype search pericom’s site has products downloads quality reports faqs application notes  regular pages and more we created a custom search solution that searches across all these different content types using appropriate matching logic for each type the results are then grouped together on a summary page and also broken out into tabs to make it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for pardotsilverstripe membership synchronization we extended silverstripe’s flexible membership model to integrate with pardot’s prospect gathering system now new user registration profile updates and other changes in the member data on the site automatically get synced with pardot internationalization  localization pericom serves clients in the us china and taiwan we implemented a special customized version of silverstripe’s multilanguage and localization features and modules
