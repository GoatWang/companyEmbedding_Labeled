microcontrollers  wireless  rf  touchscreen  memory  security  analog  custom  automotive  smart energy  see also  references  external links historyedit logo from  to  founding and s growthedit atmel corporation was founded in  by george perlegos atmel was an acronym for “advanced technology for memory and logic” perlegos had worked in the memory group of intel in the s and had cofounded seeq technology to manufacture eprom memory using only us in capital atmel was initially operated as a fabless company using sanyo and general instrument to make the chip wafers the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors customers included motorola nokia and ericsson in  intel sued atmel for patent infringement rather than fight the patent claim atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property these had better performance and even lower power consumption in addition atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on atmel used us million in venture capital for the  purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs atmel then invested another us million in manufacturing technology s expansionedit the first atmel avr prototype demo board front side back side in  atmel expanded the colorado facility after acquiring concurrent logic a fieldprogrammable gate array fpga manufacturer the company made its initial public offering ipo in  which yielded more than us million  saw atmel enter the microprocessor market the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel  the controller executed an instruction for every clock cycle as opposed to the  cycles that legacy  parts required in  atmel purchased the eerom assets of seeq technology lsi corporation acquired the rest of seeq in   in  atmel was among the first companies to license the arm architecture creating initially its at family of devices followed by the sam family and more recently a full selection of cortexbased solutions including ones based on the ultralowpower arm cortexm atmel now has dozens of families of armbased devices in  atmel opened a fabrication facility in rousset france atmel acquired european silicon structures and digital research in electronic acoustics and music dream in  atmel formed a design team in trondheim norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmels expertise in flash memory these bit harvard architecture chips were first developed in  the avr chip is the basis of most arduino opensource development boards in  atmel purchased part of temic from vishay intertechnology which provided them with a fab in germany as well as part of mhs from vishay that gave them a fab in nantes france in september  atmel acquired a fabrication plant in north tyneside england from siemens via a £ million grant from the uk government and paying siemens around us million streamliningedit atmel streamlined operations with a strategy called fablite this started in  when atmel sold the mhs fab in nantes france to xbybus in february  steven laub became a director and in august president and chief executive officer under laub atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines atmel announced the sale of its north tyneside facility fab on october   the manufacturing equipment was sold to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd tsmc and the property and associated land to highbridge business park limited in  atmel sold their fab in germany to tejas semiconductor in  atmel received approval from the french government to sell its fab to germanybased lfoundry gmbh while retaining their design center there atmel completed the sale of their secure microcontroller solutions smart card business to inside secure in february  atmel sold its digital research in electronics acoustics and music dream business which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines for us million atmels dataflash serial interface flash memory products were sold to adesto technologies in october  acquisitionsedit atmel corporate headquarters in san jose california as atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines laub also oversaw acquisitions one strategy was to participate in the touch screen market both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves in  atmel purchased quantum research group ltd now known as atmel technologies ireland limited a wholly owned subsidiary a supplier of capacitive sensing technology work done at quantum led to the  release of atmels xsense product line a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes atmel moved into internet of things technology they completed the acquisition of advanced digital design sa a spanish company that develops power line communication ozmo devices which developed products for wifi direct was acquired by atmel in december  ozmo was founded in  as hstream wireless by kateljin vleugels and roel peeters and was based in palo alto california in  atmel had approximately us billion in annual revenue with over  of their revenue from microcontrollers and net income of us million atmel purchased the smart metering product lines of idt corporation in march  atmel purchased newport media in july  this will provide atmel further capability in wireless bluetooth and wifi acquisition by microchip technologyedit in  microchip agreed to buy atmel for  billion jpmorgan chase and qatalyst partners served as financial advisers to microchip and atmel respectively the company had previously heard offers from cypress semiconductor and dialog semiconductor in  and the deal with microchip is expected to be finalized at the end of q  previously in october  atmel received an unsolicited offer from microchip technology and on semiconductor estimated at us billion the offer was eventually rejected and the companies gave up on their hostile takeover attempt atmel merged with microchip technology on july  after prolonged negotiations for us billion productsedit microcontrollersedit atmel ats microcontroller atmel atmega microcontroller a large part of atmels revenue is from microcontrollers these include the avr  and bit microcontrollers arm architecture microprocessors and armbased flash microcontrollers in addition atmel still makes microcontrollers that use the  architecture albeit improved to do singlecycle instructions supporting the microcontrollers is the atmel studio  integrated development environment which atmel offers for free they also provide an atmel software framework wireless  rfedit to provide for the internet of things iot atmel offers dualband  ghz ghz abg wifi chips from its ozmo

founding and s growthedit atmel corporation was founded in  by george perlegos atmel was an acronym for “advanced technology for memory and logic” perlegos had worked in the memory group of intel in the s and had cofounded seeq technology to manufacture eprom memory using only us in capital atmel was initially operated as a fabless company using sanyo and general instrument to make the chip wafers the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors customers included motorola nokia and ericsson in  intel sued atmel for patent infringement rather than fight the patent claim atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property these had better performance and even lower power consumption in addition atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on atmel used us million in venture capital for the  purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs atmel then invested another us million in manufacturing technology s expansionedit the first atmel avr prototype demo board front side back side in  atmel expanded the colorado facility after acquiring concurrent logic a fieldprogrammable gate array fpga manufacturer the company made its initial public offering ipo in  which yielded more than us million  saw atmel enter the microprocessor market the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel  the controller executed an instruction for every clock cycle as opposed to the  cycles that legacy  parts required in  atmel purchased the eerom assets of seeq technology lsi corporation acquired the rest of seeq in   in  atmel was among the first companies to license the arm architecture creating initially its at family of devices followed by the sam family and more recently a full selection of cortexbased solutions including ones based on the ultralowpower arm cortexm atmel now has dozens of families of armbased devices in  atmel opened a fabrication facility in rousset france atmel acquired european silicon structures and digital research in electronic acoustics and music dream in  atmel formed a design team in trondheim norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmels expertise in flash memory these bit harvard architecture chips were first developed in  the avr chip is the basis of most arduino opensource development boards in  atmel purchased part of temic from vishay intertechnology which provided them with a fab in germany as well as part of mhs from vishay that gave them a fab in nantes france in september  atmel acquired a fabrication plant in north tyneside england from siemens via a £ million grant from the uk government and paying siemens around us million streamliningedit atmel streamlined operations with a strategy called fablite this started in  when atmel sold the mhs fab in nantes france to xbybus in february  steven laub became a director and in august president and chief executive officer under laub atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines atmel announced the sale of its north tyneside facility fab on october   the manufacturing equipment was sold to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd tsmc and the property and associated land to highbridge business park limited in  atmel sold their fab in germany to tejas semiconductor in  atmel received approval from the french government to sell its fab to germanybased lfoundry gmbh while retaining their design center there atmel completed the sale of their secure microcontroller solutions smart card business to inside secure in february  atmel sold its digital research in electronics acoustics and music dream
