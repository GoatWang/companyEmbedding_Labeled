with realtek rtg the increasing popularity of hd media players in  led to the entry of realtek into that market the first series the xx models sold at a lower price than similar quality chipsets of realteks competitors the main competitors were the sigma media players realtek produced three major versions of realtek xx and several minor variations the three major xx chipset versions   and  all featured the same chip in terms of format support and performance the only difference being the added ability to record av sources in the  hd audio support in the xx improved through the chipsets life with several revisions the dd and cc versions of the chipset both added full  hdaudio support to the chipset the  players all built on a common sdk firmwareos provided by realtek this meant that they were all essentially similar in performance and interface it also meant that producing these players was very easy for manufacturers all they had to do was create the hardware and realtek provided the
