events   eever and etron launch usb typec pd solutionej controller ic performance fully upgrade december     for immediate release  news release eever and etron launch usb typec pd solutionej controller ic performance fully upgrade eever technology inc and etron technology inc tpex tw announce that their joint development product usb pd controller ic－ej hugely boosts efficiencies in delivering power transmitting data and streaming audio and video within usb typec solutions usb pd provides voltage and current and transmits communication using new specifications enabling fast charging flexibility and low power consumption the ej can deliver power of  watts at maximum and up to  amps at  volts and also allows twoway power delivery between the power provider and consumer creating a high degree of flexibility and ability to optimize power management the ej is suitable for usb  usb  and usb  interfaces and other usb specifications and can be widely used in all sorts of electronic systems and devices with charging functions etron’s usb typec pd controller ic design solutions are fully compliant with usbif’s latest usb pd specification the general efficiency of pd is improved compared to pd for data transmission whereas pd supports transmitting of only  bytes at most pd supports up to  bytes enabling transmitting more messages for example manufacturer information security information firmware update information etc for the data delivery process whereas pd cannot transmit smoothly in the event of a sudden disconnect of its power source pd can switch the role of power provider and consumer and can prevent data corruption during a sudden disconnect of its power source moreover etron’s usb typec pd controller ic is fully backward compatible with usb pd enables faster performance for firmware updates unleashes highest power efficiency and adds a certification information switching function between typec and cables during ces  jan th jan th eever’s and
