he created groundbreaking enabling technologies using a fully integrated power process in a cmos foundry in may of 99 a singlechip solution for powering ccfl backlighting in notebooks was launched the product substantially reduced the total solution cost and design complexity as well as significantly improved power conversion as a result this product stormed the laptop market by taking  market share in  and  in   immediately the company diversified into dcdc products which again reset the industry standard in november  michael took the company ipo since then the company has grown to  product lines with more than  products and thousands of customers in  michael fulfilled his vision mps introduced an industry first – a cost effective monolithic power module that truly integrates an entire power system onto a single package entering the industry into a new era of power management today with  years of nonstop innovation mps is pushing technology to an unprecedented level  volts and a current with the th generation of process technology continuing to lead the power semiconductor industry whether he is flying planes white water kayaking or mountain biking michael is constantly creating cuttingedge solutions to improve the quality of life with green easytouse power solutions under his passionate and creative leadership mps has succeeded not only in developing a monolithic power module that truly integrates an entire power system in a single package but also it continues to defy industry expectations with its patented groundbreaking technologies maurice sciammas sr vice
