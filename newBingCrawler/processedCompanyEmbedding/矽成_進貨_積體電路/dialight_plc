market opportunity the shift in the groups operating model strategically positions us to focus on long term sustainable growth the strategy gives the organisation agility allowing us to respond quickly to changing customer and market dynamics during the period we have delivered an increase in underlying profit as well as growth in cash generation group revenue was gbpm  gbpm including a favourable currency impact of gbpm the us which generates the majority of our revenues was up  on a constant currency basis the european business was down  this was partly due to certain product lines within the signals and components segments being discontinued additionally europe represents a significant lighting opportunity where we are rebuilding our capabilities developing our sales force and expanding our distribution network our new product road map includes the breadth of product features and certification requirements needed to capture these european opportunities lighting order intake grew  year on year at constant currency despite the impact of the transition delays discussed below our customers have delayed placing orders pending new product launches this has been partly mitigated by encouraging new business wins underlying operating profit increased to gbpm  gbpm including a favourable currency impact of gbpm nonunderlying costs totalled gbpm  gbpm further details are provided in the financial review section platform engineering a key prerequisite of the transition of our manufacturing footprint has been successfully completed the move to a platform concept allows dialight to deliver solutions to customers that better match their specific requirements while being configured from a greatly reduced set of subassemblies this has improved forecast accuracy for manufacturing planning and will result in reduced inventory once the transition to our manufacturing partner has been completed we have fundamentally improved supply chain management and streamlined our operations this is clearly demonstrated in the gross margin expansion we have achieved in the period completion of the transition is taking slightly longer than expected we have experienced delays in the certification of some of the products being transferred but we expect to complete the transition by the end of the year to ensure continuity of supply to our customers we decided to keep our own facility running in parallel and this will lead to a short period of dual running costs as we finalise the foundations of a robust and scalable manufacturing platform we pivot our attention to driving revenue growth in the industrial lighting market purchase decisions are driven by payback and risk our value proposition continues to ensure that dialight products provide the best cost of ownership to heavy industrial customers with paybacks based on energy savings maintenance cost avoidance backed by a ten year warranty there has been progress in integrating dialight lighting with leading factory automation solutions dialight and its strategic customers continue to explore new ways to use these solutions to enhance factory safety and productivity dialights sales model is direct specification sale to end users transacting through distributors direct sale allows for the value proposition to be articulated distributor inclusion enables simplified contracting and support for larger supply contracts we have added  new distributors with a key focus on expanding the distribution network in europe market conditions the main barrier to led conversion is capex budget constraints there are three key approaches to proactively drive accelerated market adoption by changing spending paradigms  enable maintenance spend  target a one year payback  access different budgets the corporate sustainability and safety budget design engineering budgets and process productivity budgets  promote market awareness of advantages of leds dialight recognises the opportunity to drive focus on corporate wide led conversion programmes the majority of dialights targeted strategic customers have a public commitment to sustainability including carbon footprint reduction and energy savings programmes additionally customers place a premium on work place safety driving awareness of the economic benefits as well as the sustainability and safety benefits of our lighting at the corporate level can change the perception of lighting away from just maintenance cost savings we target corporate energy sustainability and ehs directors and maintain a team focused on serving large new build projects current quoting activity remains favorable with a strong pipeline and both short and longterm drivers of the markets we serve remain positive we expect to grow in the markets we serve by executing our strategy focused on opportunities in underpenetrated geographies and industries and growth from the continued introduction of new lighting and building management solutions as part of our integrated solutions strategy based on various leading indicators and our focused investments in key strategic areas we remain confident regarding the companys prospects for long term profitable growth outlook we are focused on executing the groups ambitious growth strategy as we seek to capture the opportunity in the industrial led lighting market the transformation to a robust

with the final three lines to be completed by the end of the year we remain excited by the groups prospects and remain confident of delivering continued growth and shareholder value our expectations for the second half of  remain unchanged financial review in the half year we delivered an increase in underlying profit and cash flow on revenue growth of   at constant currency group revenue was gbpm  gbpm including a favourable currency exchange impact of gbpm the us which generates the majority of our revenue was up  on a constant currency basis the european business was down  this was partly due to certain product lines within the signals and components segments being discontinued we also continued our efforts to develop outside of the us with australian revenues up  at constant currency underlying operating profit increased to gbpm  gbpm including a favourable exchange impact of gbpm the increase in the groups underlying profit was a result of the fundamental shift in dialights operating model which has reduced costs and enabled scalable efficient production  procurement programmes resulting in gbpm improvement in cost of sales  the closure of the uk facility has delivered savings of gbpm and further efficiencies of gbpm at our mexico plant  offset partly by an increase of gbpm in the cost base due to continued investment in the sales and product management teams currency impact dialight reports its results in sterling our major trading currency is the us dollar with  of revenue denominated in us dollars the group has both translational and transactional currency exposure translational exposures arise on the consolidation of overseas company results into sterling and this is the major currency exposure transactional exposure is more limited with natural hedging on revenue and purchases mitigating the majority of the currency risk the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the first half of  has been the main driver for the currency impact the average rate for the us dollar against sterling has moved from  in first half of  to  in the first half of  the performance of each business segment is reviewed individually below allocation of

at constant currency year on year order intake increased by  we have seen growth in order intake in the us and australia but this was offset by reduced orders in europe transition delays have impacted the groups order intake as certain customers have delayed placing orders pending new product launches we continue to diversify our end markets and geographies reducing our exposure to individual vertical markets oil and gas as a percentage of total lighting revenue was bps lower than the previous half year at  this was offset by growth in mining power and pulp  paper gross margin has increased to  due to the focus on commodity management delivering material costs savings of gbpm last year we closed our manufacturing plant in the uk and relocated the majority of production activity to mexico the strategic relocation and further production efficiencies at the mexico plant resulted in a saving of gbpm the delays in the transition will defer expected savings from our manufacturing partner to q  overheads increased by gbpm compared to  with gbpm due to currency movements the remainder of the increase relates to additional headcount to enhance our product development capabilities and expand our sales team we have invested in training for the existing team and continue to be heavily focused on our hr initiatives the overall impact of the above was that profit in the lighting

increase of gbpm over the prior year nonunderlying costs the group incurs costs and earns income that is nonunderlying in nature or that is otherwise considered to not be reflective of the underlying performance of the business in the assessment of performance of the components of the group management examines underlying performance which removes the impact of nonunderlying costs and income over the past two years the group has been implementing our strategic plan to transform to a robust and scalable manufacturing platform as we come to the end of this process we are incurring the final

time this transition has suffered some delays due to the quantum of the transfer but is still expected to be completed in the year we expect further costs of up to gbpm to be incurred in the second half in the prior year nonunderlying costs related to the closure of the uk manufacturing facility expected redundancy costs at the mexican production facility goodwill impairment on the european traffic business and initial production transfer costs to our manufacturing partner finance arrangements we continue to have a strong balance sheet supported by good working capital management finishing the six months with net cash of gbpm the group has a revolving credit facility with hsbc bank plc for gbpm with a further gbpm accordion feature and has a fiveyear term ending in  the group has no borrowings against the facility at the balance sheet date and is fully compliant with its covenant requirements as the group generates higher levels of cash there is increased focus on capital allocation ensuring it is aligned to our long term strategic goals our capital allocation strategy is firstly to ensure investment in operating capex and product development we seek to maintain a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility we will be good stewards of capital with strong capital discipline any excess capital will be utilised to invest in compelling organic and

operating segments these segments have been identified based on the internal information that is supplied regularly to the groups chief operating decision maker for the purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources the chief operating decision maker is considered to be the groups chief executive the two reportable operating segments are a lighting which develops manufactures and supplies highly efficient led lighting solutions for hazardous and industrial applications in which lighting performance is critical and includes anticollision obstruction lighting and b signals and components which develops manufactures and supplies status indication components for electronics oems together with niche industrial and automotive electronic components and highly efficient led signalling solutions for the traffic and signals markets all revenue relates to the sale of goods segment gross profit is revenue less the costs of materials labour production and freight that are

certified product introduction aviationnavigationlight surveillance system since the ’s we have supplied aviation obstruction lights to the wind industry for more than  years we have constantly improved and expanded our product portfolio all our products comply with international regulation icao faa and are adapted to the differing national standards aviation obstruction lights are typically required for turbines which total height exceed  m but the requirements differ from market to market and also from location to location within a country the purpose of aviation obstruction lights is to mark the turbine as an obstacle at day and at night to air traffic both civil and military both onshore and offshore the lights are installed on the nacelle and sometimes additionally on the tower of the turbine dialight was the first to invent and produce led obstruction lights for low intensity medium intensity and high intensity applications for the wind industry our entire aviation and aids to navigations product portfolio for the wind sector uses led lighting solutions today our products have a buildin gps for the synchronisation of the beacons this means that the gps unit is integrated into the beacon and is thus better protected against weather and hazardous environments like the north sea in the following we present our products in detail the majority of our products is available als “cold climate version ccv” see all aviation products permanent aids to navigation besides aviation obstruction lights offshore wind turbines require additional marking due to their location at sea they need to be marked as an obstacle to maritime traffic during construction and during their lifetime under operation the products required for the marking at sea are called “aids to navigation” in short aton dialight as has delivered aton components to the offshore wind industry since  our first projects were avedøre and middelgrunden in denmark followed by burbo banks in the uk since then we have gathered comprehensive experience with offshore projects’ aids to navigation systems both on the engineering installation and operational side our products comply with international iala and the respective national regulation we are today one of the market leaders in this field and have delivered our solutions to all important offshore markets and offshore customers we offer single products and complete systems including aids to navigation components control and monitoring systems dialight as aton solution consists usually of a combination of the following components depending on national regulation marine lantern id marking signs boards daynight id floodlights for the proximity marking helicopter corridor lights uninterruptible power supply ups automatic identification systems ais visibility meters fog signals monitoring and control systems for the above components using programmable logic controllers plc dialight as provides custom lighting and control solutions for each market that meet or exceeds local requirements   in the following we give two examples of what is usually required in the uk and germany as the two biggest european offshore markets the examples show the requirements for turbines placed on the periphery of an offshore wind farm click for larger version or see full image click for larger version or see full image see all navigation products temporary aids to navigation during construction when there is no electricity produced by the wind turbine itself for the aton components the wind park needs to be marked with socalled “temporary aton” these consist of selfcontained buoys that are placed on different locations at the periphery of the construction site the socalled safety zone and of solarpowered marine lanterns that are placed on the foundations under construction dialight as offers our customers a complete temporary marking solution together with our partner maritim consult that has extensive experience from both the offshore sector and harbor infrastructure we assist our customers with choosing the right solution for their project according to national legislation and individual preferences instead of purchasing the temporary aton we also offer a service of renting the buoys during the course of construction please contact our sales department for further information dialight as has developed an outstanding intelligent surveillance unit “bti’s light surveillance system” that monitors the functioning of the different aviation obstruction lighting systems and aton components the system is
