formed in ottawa canada on june th  and is quoted on the tsx venture exchange under the symbol dnx the company has one subsidiary dynex semiconductor limited which is whollyowned and based in lincoln england the company and its subsidiary are engaged in the design manufacture and sale of industrial power equipment apart from a few administrative activities carried out by dynex power inc all the business of the group is carried out by dynex semiconductor limited in 8 zhuzhou csr times electric co ltd “csr times electric” acquired approximately  of the share capital of the company and thus became the company’s immediate parent company in  csr times electric changed its name to zhuzhou crrc times electric co ltd crrc times electric is itself majority owned by crrc corporation limited which is therefore the company’s ultimate parent company both crrc times electric and the crrc corporation limited are established in the people’s republic of china and are themselves quoted companies dynex’s business and strategy the group also provides advice and assistance primarily to crrc times electric on matters relating to semiconductor design and manufacture all the activities of the group described above take place in a single factory in lincoln england often using common facilities and shared staff consequently the group regards bipolar discrete power modules and die power electronic assemblies and the provision of advice as separate product groups for revenue analysis but does not regard them as separate operating segments for reporting purposes the group does not analyse gross margins expenses taxation net profit or assets by product group due to the nature of silicon wafer fabrication there is a relatively high level of fixed costs in the business consequently the profitability of the business is particularly responsive to the volume of production and therefore the overall level of revenue management does not regard the business as seasonal in the case of power assemblies small numbers of large contracts drive revenues the delivery of a large contract in a particular quarter can cause revenue to fluctuate significantly giving the appearance of seasonality
