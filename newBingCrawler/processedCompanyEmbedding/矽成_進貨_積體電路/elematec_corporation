：fisco  ：fisco  ：  ◆summary formulated the new medium to longterm growth strategy “elematec x cross” targeting growth markets through globalization and modularization elematec corporation  also referred to as the company below is an electronics trading company that specializes in electronic materials it was formed through the merger of takachiho electric co ltd and ohnishi denki co ltd in  and entered the toyota tsusho corporation  group in   sales and profits weakened in fy though posted second highest net sales and third highest operating income elematec reported weaker sales and profits in fy at ¥mn in net sales  yoy and ¥mn in operating income  these results missed initial forecast but exceeded lowered targets and posted second highest net sales and third highest operating income we think it turned in a solid performance despite pressure from roughly ¥mn yoy decline in smartphonerelated sales  globalization and modularization are key words in the growth strategy elematec formulated a medium to longterm growth strategy with the new slogan “elematec x cross” it sets globalization and modularization as key words for medium to longterm growth in “globalization” elematec seeks to leverage an overseas network to arrange direct accounts with end users worldwide in “modularization” elematec plans and designs products that meet customer requirements and are sold as intermediate “component modules” rather than selling individual items as standalone products this approach strives to increase added value for planning design and production and thereby expand the company’s earnings  expects increases in sales and profits in fy planning to sharply raise the dividend thanks to a rebound in profit attributable owners of parent the fy forecast aims for increases in sales and profits with net sales at ¥mn  yoy and operating income at ¥mn  demand in smartphonerelated business which switched to a recovery from q fy remains upbeat thus far in the new fiscal year while elematec takes a cautious view because of concerns about ramp up of oleds for smartphones from h its current forecast appears conservative in light of the weaker yen trend in forex rates and other tailwinds elematec intends to pay a sharply higher dividend owing to a significant rebound in profit attributable owners of parent on nonrecurrence of extraordinary losses ◆company overview two companies with specialties in electronic materials merged in  broadened to the automotive field by entering the toyota tsusho group  history and business overview the company’s predecessors were takachiho electric established in  in tokyo and ohnishi denki founded in  in kyoto both companies began by handling insulation materials subsequently broadened the scope of their product offerings to electronic materials used in electronic products following technology and development trends and grew into being independent technology trading companies these companies merged in  with takachiho electric as the surviving entity and adopted the elematec name the company has steadily grown since the merger even though both predecessors mainly handled electronic materials thanks to complementary geographical positions in tokyo and kyoto it became a subsidiary of toyota tsusho through a tob transaction in  and this is its current position the company had  employees on a consolidated basis as of the end of fy it operates a domestic service network with  sites and an overseas service network with  sites regional sales breakdown consists of japan at  china including hong kong at  other asia taiwan korea india and southeast asia at  and the us and europe us mexico and czech at  possesses strengths in planning and development that leverage a broad range of customers and products as well as robust operational capabilities  company features and strengths as explained in previous reports including the report issued on december   we think elematec possesses the following attributes and strengths  significant diversity in counterparts and products  flexible support for growth markets and  manufacturing functions to help in gaining an even deeper understanding of these features and strengths below we analyze elematec from the standpoint of services and functions its supplies to customers elematec operates  sites in japan and other countries and handles transactions of electronic materials and electronic components among about  supplier firms roughly  in japan and  from other countries and  customer companies around  in japan and  in other countries elematec goes beyond just the basic services and functions of an electronics trading company of optimal supply of parts and materials credit provision and financing and delivery timing and inventory management it also supplies processing services integrated procurement services and other more advanced services and functions that gen­erate higher added value while elematec highlights five services and functions we think integrated procurement services processing services and planning and development functions stand out as core features and strengths  integrated procurement services integrated procurement services covers procurement of raw materials for customers plus internal logistics at customers key points are finding and procuring ideal parts and materials that meet the specifications required by users from roughly  domestic and overseas suppliers and supplying these items on a justintime basis to domestic and overseas plants of customer companies with elematec responsible for quality and delivery timing management we think this service provides differentiation from rivals and contributes to customer retention because few companies are capable of effectively handling this full range of operations we expect demand for integrated procurement services delivered by elematec to continue growing particularly in light of chronic manpower shortages in sections in charge of procurement and internal logistics even at many large companies amid efforts to improve business efficiency and reduce employee levels the challenge with integrated procurement services meanwhile is inherently low profitability while integrated procurement service is effective as the initial entry point in building transaction relationships with customers it can wind up just increasing sales and not delivering profits on its own after beginning the relationship with an inte­grated procurement service framework other aspects must be added such as proposals to revise specifications switching to parts and materials that are more profitable and expanding transactions to other parts and materials these measures should be pursued after obtaining strong customer satisfaction through reliable provision of initial integrated procurement services elematec has been largely succeeding in realization of this type of positive spiral even if not in every case we think it is important for elematec to solidify a pattern of enhancing profitability in integrated procurement services in light of significant latent outsourcing demand  processing services elematec is a trading company and adheres to a stance of avoiding competition with manufacturers who are transaction counterparts however customers sales destinations often request delivery of processed items elematec has its own processing sites to accommodate these needs – one in japan and two in china in japan elematec logi serve corporation based in yokohama processes and manufactures electric materials and other products conducts acceptance inspections and handles environmentrelated material measurements in china elematec electronics dalian co ltd implements surface mounting of parts into electronic circuit boards and elematec wuxi technology co ltd handles silkscreen printing for plastic panels cutting and processing and assembly elematec starts generating added value and increasing profitability once it gets to the point of supplying custom­ized products that it has planned and designed utilizing new product development information and information about the latest technology trends and other developments that it possesses this is what elematec refers to as “modularization” its promotion of modularization often overlaps with promotion of planning and development functions explained below if planning and development functions work well and deals are arranged modularization business naturally occurs elematec does not limit itself to manufacturing and processing at only its own processing sites in modularization business however it is beneficial to outsource from a position of directly having processing and manufacturing technologies we will be looking for elematec to accumulate experiences and technologies in processing services and apply them to module processing at its own plants  planning and development functions planning and development business begins with appropriate understanding of customer needs fundamental flow in this business involves elematec identifying optimal parts and materials from its roughly  domestic and overseas suppliers to meet wideranging needs at customers for electronics mechatronics exteriors design and other aspects or planning products that satisfy requirements even creating product prototypes in some cases and submitting proposals to customers two essential ingredients in this business are “grasping” and “realizing” needs not many rival companies have both of these capabilities and we believe this function is another source of differentiation for elematec versus other companies additionally adoption of new products based on elematec’s plans and designs means that it becomes an onlyone presence to the customer firm we think this is a very effective way of strengthening relationships with customers as explained above these new products should generate high profitability due to elematec’s role of processing into modules for delivery the three services described above are similar in their provision of “differentiation” as services and functions that cannot be easily achieved by other companies in the same industry and “customer retention” by securing trust from customers through the process and positioning elematec as a vital presence to customers we believe the diversity of transaction partners and products in elematec’s business enables it to deliver these functions and services these broad transaction relationships naturally put elematec into contact with the latest products and technologies elematec leverages knowledge obtained from its activities together with planning and proposal capabilities as a technology trading company to cultivate new relationships and offer new products we think elematec’s primary strength resides in its establishment of this “beneficial cycle” ◆results trends sales and profits weakened in fy though posted second highest net sales and third highest operating income  review of fy results elematec reported weaker sales and profits in fy at ¥mn in net sales  yoy ¥mn in operating income  ¥mn in ordinary income  and ¥mn in profit attributable owners of parent  however consolidation of  months for some subsidiaries in fy exaggerated sales and profit decline rates elematec lowered fy forecast at the q announcement and operating income and other profit items exceeded the revised values in fy while sales and profits weakened elematec posted second highest net sales and third highest operating income we think it turned in a solid performance despite pressure from steep decline in mainstay smartphonerelated sales over the past few years net sales dropped ¥mn yoy in fy we give a detailed explanation of decline factors below however the largest setback by demand segment came from the roughly ¥mn yoy decline in smartphonerelated sales overall sales decline totaled ¥mn as noted above even with this downturn in smartphone business and suspension of the company’s sales to building materials thanks to expansion of surfacemounting business for lcd parts to the ¥mn range in earnings meanwhile surfacemounting business gains were not enough to fully offset profits lost from steep decline in smartphonerelated sales this is because of low profit margin in surfacemounting business that is similar to integrated procurement service gross margin fell pp from fy’s  to  due to lower sales plus less favorable product mix in sga expenses personnel costs declined due to a drop in bonus payments that are linked to earnings but transportation costs moved upward on expansion of surfacemounting business and other expenses increased from booking provisions to the bad credit allowance sga expenses narrowed by ¥mn yoy though the ratio of sga expenses to sales climbed by pp from  to  given these results operating income slipped ¥mn  yoy to ¥mn and operating income margin contracted pp to  the larger decline in profit attributable owners of parent meanwhile stemmed from booking ¥mn in extraor­dinary losses including a provision of ¥mn to the bad credit allowance elematec booked reserves for the full value of credits to a building materials counterpart in china it already ended activity with this company and took a onetime loss in fy sales dropped mainly on declines in smartphonerelated sales and building materials business in china automotive business continues to expand at a healthy pace  trends by individual markets elematec discloses sales by three market segments – digital electronics automotive and broad market digital electronics sales rose ¥mn yoy in fy smartphones are the final product market for lcds touch panels tps and backlights bls sold under this segment this area posted a sales gain of ¥mn due to a roughly ¥mn lift from mounting business its sales hence were down by about ¥mn on a real basis mobile terminal which also refer to smartphone business encountered a setback of ¥mn industrial equipment under the broad market segment recorded sales related to smartphones vibration motor parts and materials as well in fy these three areas worked out to a decline in smartphonerelated sales of roughly ¥mn weighing heavily on elematec’s income for other areas sales improved by ¥mn in toys and hobbies and ¥mn in tvs and monitors automotive sales climbed ¥mn yoy in its only subsegment of automotiverelated business the real gain which excludes the impact of month consolidation in the previous year was ¥mn this result confirms healthy growth broad market sales fell sharply by ¥mn yoy while aftermarket sales increased ¥mn industrial machinery sales were off by ¥mn and housing sales declined by ¥mn industrial machinery business faced a decline in sales of smartphone vibration motors as noted above house building weakness reflected the drop in transactions for building materials in china which were the cause of the extraordinary loss ◆medium to longterm growth strategy formulated the new slogan – “elematec x cross”  overview of the medium to longterm strategy elematec does not prepare mediumterm business plans with a fixed period but it formulates basic policies for initiatives related to a medium to longterm strategy and proceeds with business on this basis it updated the internal slogan in fy switching from “elematec  plus” to “elematec x cross” “cross” means combining things to create synergies and accelerate business it also refers to “agility” for emphasis on timely action the new slogan presents four visions we are primarily interested in vision  “innovation planning and developing important technologies” and vision  “global realizing support on par with domestic operations worldwide including emerging markets” while more details are given below we think the growth strategy in “elematec x cross” can be readily understood with the two key words of “globalization” and “modularization” as longerterm its numerical goals elematec discloses a twoyear forward outlook along with forecast for the fiscal year at the start of each year this is a rollingtype mediumterm plan elematec presented a fy forecast for ¥mn in sales and ¥mn in ordinary income this time while these are the same goals given for fy from a year ago we think it restated the ¥mn in sales because it is an important threshold value   ，，。 top 【】 ，、，。，。，、，。。 　　　　～　　ads securitiesfxcmfiscoironfxmorning

accounts with overseas final customers to avoid the impact of weakening at japanese manufacturers  globalization initiatives with global direct accounts globalization is one of the two vital measures being promoted under “elematec x cross” this means promotion of global direct accounts in past overseas business elematec mainly supplied electronic materials and other parts and materials to japanese devices and electronic parts manufacturers and sold parts and materials produced by these companies to overseas assemblers and final product manufacturers this approach limited direct transactions with overseas companies in the new initiative meanwhile elematec wants to establish its own accounts with overseas final product manufacturers and conduct transactions directly an important backdrop of its decision to pursue establishment of global direct accounts is relative decline in the standing of japanese electronics companies which are elematec’s direct customers using smartphones as an example few manufacturers have businesses with sufficient presence in not only the global market but the japanese market as well the same can be said for lcd and oled panels a key component we think concern that continued reliance just on japanese manufacturers could ultimately lead to shrinking business provided the catalyst for elematec to move forward with fullfledged globalization a specific action is revision of business style to address regional conditions in china we expect elematec to primarily target final assemblers of smartphones tvs and other consumer electronics in this process elematec has raised topics such as recruitment of local suppliers for cost reasons building personal ties with top executives in light of business practices and localizing management from the standpoint of business practices initiatives in asia asean taiwan korea and india are expanding sales to local manufacturers in the digital electronics segment and automotive market such as onboard electronic devices and localizing management similar to china for the us and europe elematec aims to expand sales channels to nonjapanese automakers strengthen support for japanese automakers and develop sites to facilities broader sales coverage proposes solutions based on its own planning design and prototyping to customers with the aim of increasing added value  modularization creating technical solutions and added value the other core initiative in “elematec x cross” is creating technical solutions and added value this involves the same content as the “planning and development function” explained in the section on the company’s attributes and strengths in other words it begins with appropriate understanding of customer needs and then involves elematec identifying optimal parts and materials from its roughly  domestic and overseas suppliers to meet wideranging needs at customers for electronics mechatronics exteriors design and other aspects or planning designing and prototyping products that satisfy requirements and proposing solutions to customers if customers select proposals products that elematec has prepared and developed elematec delivers modularized products and can expand earnings from this added value in comparison to selling electronic materials and other items just as materials understanding customer needs the first step in this process needs to take place at the customer’s development stage that defines specifications while elematec has handled many products adopted at this early stage we think it is important to increase this even more modularization initiatives are useful in building business with japanese manufacturers and should also serve as an effective tool in cultivation of global direct accounts mentioned above some examples that have been well received are decorative processing on the front panel of smartphones touch panel and lcd alignment modules and automotive decorative technology and plating technology targeting new technology and demand opportunities in various markets through integration modularization of sensing and communications  growth strategies by market elematec envisions a breakdown for its fy sales goal of ¥mn of digital electronics at ¥mn automotive at ¥mn and broad market at ¥mn these levels require upbeat growth rates and elematec hopes to reach them through “further expansion mainly driven by module product sales” while elematec presents strategies for individual markets “provision of sensing and communications solutions” is a common strategy in all markets this approach aims to secure sales channels in the most basic area for the iot and ict era it then adds priority items for each of the three markets  strategy for the digital electronics market elematec’s assessment of current conditions in the digital electronics market depicts  slower growth rates and tougher competition for smartphones  rising demand for iotrelated devices and  growing applications for oleds its business priorities are recruiting auto display business increasing sales of mobile housings and embedded parts promoting oled parts and materials and expanding sales of reinforced glass  strategy for the automotive market in the automotive market elematec sees the two most significant market changes as growing demand in driving assistance and reinforced development of connected cars its business priorities are expanding sales of parts and materials used in adas advanced driver assistance systems increasing hmi human machine interface switches buttons handles and others items that enables people to operate the machine and decorative business and boosting direct transactions with overseas tier tier parts manufacturers  strategy for the broad market for the broad market elematec is aware of the need for multiple overseas production sites in light of market diversity it also expects growing demand for sensing devices with iot advances its priorities are strengthening sales to aftermarket segments expanding modules for consumer electronics and increasing modules for medical and industrial equipment elematec talks about alliances as a common strategy in pursuit of these three market it is pursuing synergies with the toyota tsusho group and aims to bolster collaboration with new materials and parts manufacturers steadily expanding products handled and customer volume for the massive display devices and automotive market  progress in major markets  overall image the wide range of suppliers products and customers is another elematec strength as explained above however even this type company or perhaps because it has such broad coverage ends up with growing sales to products that have large markets or products with extensive related industries current examples are smartphones and automobiles while some observers refer to elematec as a “company with strength in smartphones” or a “smartphonerelated stock” our view is that it is a “company with strength in display devices” lcd panels are the primary type in the display market at this point and smartphones occupy a large presence as the application this is why many of the products handled by elematec are utilized in smartphones as the final product oleds a new display device are currently about to move from the initial emergence stage to a growth stage elematec naturally needs to clarify its standing in supply of parts and materials to oleds as a company that excels in display devices we think elematec has two main approaches to the automobile market one is expansion of applications and usage volume for display devices in vehicles this business comes within the framework of display devices and is covered by digital electronics in elematec’s disclosure information the other is supply of parts and materials besides display devices elematec books sales in this business under the automotive segment it aims to achieve growth by capitalizing on both of these opportunities  current state of lcd touch panel and backlight markets and progress the “lcd touch panel and backlight” subsegment under digital electronics in elematec’s disclosure information covers products for display devices while it has many destination end user markets smartphones are the overwhelmingly largest market followed by onboard and consumer electronics a smartphone lcd panels elematec faced sharp production adjustments at the start of q fy but business recovered from q fy and continued a healthy recovery trend in q business remains upbeat in fy too additionally increased sales of highprecision and advanced parts and materials to highend models in china lifted earnings in q fy elematec expects moderate increases in sales of parts and materials to chinese highend models again in fy b onboard lcd panels car navigation systems were the primary onboard lcd panel in past years but the emergence of vehicles without side mirrors is likely to contribute to expansion in the volume and size of lcd panels and other display devices mainly around the driver’s seat over the medium term provision of visibility is a key driver for onboard panels elematec has antireflection technology cultivated for smartphones and hopes to utilize these capabilities to expand business opportunities onboard lcd panels experience a much tougher usage environment than smartphone panels elematec intends to utilize its knowhow and technology to sell optimal display parts and materials molded parts glass etc backlight films and other items c response to oleds usage of oleds in smartphone displays is likely to ramp up in fy elematec has been making proposals for oled parts and materials and is delivering products to a japanese oled firm however this has not advanced as a specific business yet because the oeld firm is still in the prototype phase oleds and lcd panels have overlapping applications so are competing and can replace each other while this is often interpreted as a disadvantage for elematec because its oled business has not started yet the replacement of lcds with oleds is unlikely to take place suddenly and lcd panels should continue as the main format for the time being nevertheless the lcd panel growth rate will be curtailed and elematec is acting promptly with responses in light of this trend  current state of the automotive market and progress main items besides display devices for the automotive market currently are hmirelated parts and materials glass light sources heat dissipation sheets plastic parts and optical products elematec has accumulated technology and knowhow for glass front side panel processing decorative molding and plating used in smartphones and other products customers highly rate these capabilities and elematec utilizes them in automotive business as well growth areas in recent years are led headlamp lightsource assemblies molding sales and cables and wire harnesses in particular led headlamp light sources have emerged as a new business opportunity amid rapid advances in the shift to led light sources in recent years and this area appears to be steadily expanding customers are not just japanese auto companies it appears that us and european auto companies are major final customers reflecting favorable reactions to elematec’s global site deployment as explained above integration of sensing and communications is the core theme in elematec’s medium and longerterm strategy for sensing devices it is focusing on ir sensors and other sensors as well as various camera module products camera modules are vital components in vehicles without side mirrors adas and driverless vehicles elematec is trying to work its way into this business it appears to have already started sales initiatives for lens modules cmos sensors shielding materials and housings harnesses and other parts and materials to multiple leading automotive parts manufacturers jointly with customers for communications the other aspect elematec plans to strengthen its proposals for communications equipment modules while it currently handles milliwave radar materials heat discharge materials and shielding materials in this general category elematec envisions communications equipment with modules that contain communications and sensing devices cultivated in the smartphone business we will be waiting for advances in this business ◆business outlook targeting higher sales and profits as growth in automotive sales offset decline in lcdrelated sales elematec guides for ¥mn in net sales  yoy ¥mn in operating income  ¥mn in ordinary profit  and ¥mn in profit attributable owners of parent  in fy the large growth rate in profit attributable owners of parent stems from nonrecurrence of the extraordinary loss booked in fy elematec manages its budget on a fullyear basis and does not prepare h forecast the low sales growth rate at just  yoy takes into account exhaustion of mounting business forex assumption impact it uses ¥usd versus fy’s ¥ and anticipated impact from some customers switching from lcds to oleds elematec expects a pp rise in operating margin based on decreased demand of lowmargin mounting business and sales replacement by products with average margin we think the projections of sales declines in lcds touch panels and backlights and mobile handsets under digital electronics reflecting the impact of the switch to oleds stands out in the outlook for major markets conversely elematec forecasts a large ¥mn  yoy rise in automotive sales thanks to the start of car models that contains its products from design specifications prepared a few years earlier we think elematec’s guidance and assumptions are convincing however the earnings outlook seems conservative in light of strong sales momentum from q fy continuing in q fy and the current forex rate that puts the yen at a cheaper level than the plan’s assumption while it is still too early to discuss the possibility of an upward revision at the q announcement it is worth thinking about elematec’s forex sensitivity a single year of depreciation versus the usd adds ¥bn to sales and ¥mn to ordinary profit for the year ◆shareholder return policy basic policy targets dividend payout of at least  expecting a large dividend hike in fy that reflects profit recovery elematec primarily pays dividends as its shareholder return policy and aims to keep the dividend payout ratio at  or above while taking into account the earnings outlook shortterm and medium term growth investments cash flow and other factors when elematec lowered the fy forecast during fy it also reduced the fullyear dividend target from ¥ at periodstart ¥ interim ¥ periodend to ¥ ¥ each for interim and periodend dividends it announced the fy dividend as ¥ in line with the revised view the dividend payout was  for fy elematec presented a ¥ dividend target ¥ interim ¥ periodend that reflects the anticipated steep increase in net income attributable to parent shareholders dividend payout based on the ¥ eps estimate works out to  we think the dividend could vary again this year depending on the earnings trend because the initial estimated payout ratio is very close to the  basic policy   ，，。 top 【】 ，、，。，。，、，。。 　　　　～　　ads securitiesfxcmfiscoironfxmorning starifitislipperemerging capitalingsaxoiforexswissquote     no
