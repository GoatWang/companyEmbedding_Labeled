supplier for automotive applications the automotive electronics market has been advancing rapidly from past applications such as the vehicles entertainment system smart dashboards and clusters and advanced driver assistance systems adas to new technologies such as smart cars internet of vehicles and the autonomous car extending these trends in the future each vehicle may resemble an individual artificial intelligence server and the demand for high reliable memory products will increase macronixs newly launched nand flash adopts its own patented nm semiconductor manufacturing technology that overcomes the short life cycle deficiency of nand flash which typically occurs with shrinking semiconductor technology nodes or technology with multiple bits stored in each cell testing results indicate that the more bits stored within a single memory cell the lower the number of pe cycles programerase cycles in addition to decreasing the products reliability nevertheless with patented manufacturing technologies and reliable circuit design ip intellectual property macronixs series of nand flash memory are very efficient  the single bit per cell floating gate technology used thereof is not only fast but also reliable which meets the requirements of high memory capacity fast transmission rates as well as the highest reliability for automotive use  in general macronixs nand flash memory is capable of storing data for at least  years or  programming times surpassing current jedec standards macronix nand flash family is offered in gb to gb densities supporting both spi and parallel interface with operation temperature range from °c to °c with significantly improved reliability as compared to the conventional °c chip specification currently available in the market due to the stringent limitations of nand flash memorys temperature compensation and work voltage the extended operation temperature range of macronixs automotive nand flash memory provides extra flexibility towards the nand flash memorys data retention and full function operation capabilities giving it a notable advantage in fanless applications which is becoming increasingly common in space constrained
