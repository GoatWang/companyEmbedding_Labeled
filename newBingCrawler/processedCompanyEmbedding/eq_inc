environmentallyresponsible or green marketing is a business practice that takes into account consumer concerns about promoting preservation and conservation of the natural environment green marketing campaigns highlight the superior environmental protection characteristics of a companys products and services whether those benefits take the form of reduced waste in packaging increased energy efficiency in product use or decreased release of toxic emissions and other pollutants in production green production green production is a business strategy that focuses on profitability through environmentally friendly operating processes proponents of this management philosophy contend that green production is a sensible course to follow not only because of the benefits that it bestows on the natural environment but also because of its fundamental strategic soundness grievance procedures grievance procedures are a means of dispute resolution that can be used to address complaints by employees against management or to settle disputes between a company and its suppliers customers or competitors the bestknown application of grievance procedures is as a formal process outlined in labor union contracts groupthink groupthink occurs when the pressure to conform within a group interferes with that groups analysis of a problem and causes poor group decision making individual

formal systems devised for the management of people within an organization these human resources responsibilities are generally divided into three major areas of management staffing employee compensation and definingdesigning work human resource management and the law the field of human resources management is greatly influenced and shaped by state and federal employment legislation indeed regulations and laws govern all aspects of human resource management including recruitment placement development and compensation areas human resource policies human resource policies are the formal rules and guidelines that businesses put in place to hire train assess and reward the members of their work force these policies when organized and disseminated in an easily used form—such as an employee manual or large postings—can go far toward eliminating any misunderstandings between employees and employers about their rights and obligations in the business environment income statements an income statement presents the results of a companys operations for a given reporting period along with the balance sheet the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in owners equity the income statement is one of the primary means of financial reporting green production  advantage benefits cost defining and instituting green production processes home encyclopedia of small business eqinc green production green production green production is a business strategy that focuses on profitability through environmentally friendly operating processes proponents of this management philosophy contend that green production is a sensible course to follow not only because of the benefits that it bestows on the natural environment but also because of its fundamental strategic soundness as stuart hart director of the university of michigans corporate environmental management program cemp indicated in northwest environmental journal green business strategies based on the principle of environmental sustainability may constitute a key basis for competitive advantage in the coming decades other business observers concur with this evaluation writing in business horizons j stephen shi and jane m kane asserted that many companies that take a proactive stance toward environmental improvements in production have a decided advantage over businesses that are indifferent to—or actively oppose—new standards first they gain a greener image in the public eye second because adopting new standards takes time and money they have more time to develop methods for reducing waste and can do so on their own schedule companies that wait until they are forced to change often find themselves in an expensive lastminute scramble to meet the requirements as a result they end up throwing more money at the problem for a less effective solution than their more proactive counterparts defining and instituting green production processes many people think that green production simply entails instituting pollution controls or recycling programs when manufacturing goods the reality however is that green production processes seek to minimize the impact of the manufacturing process on the environment at every stage as hart observed in northwest environmental journal pollution prevention … can only deliver half the loaf green production also means that firms transform their input raw material use and output product disposition processes george zinkhan and les carlson agreed stating in the journal of advertising that green consumers are worried about more than just the purchase and the consumption processes they are also concerned about the production process in terms of scarce resources consumed taking all these factors into consideration hart and p shrivastava defined green production as follows in a study titled greening organizations green production focuses upon three fundamental goals  minimize emissions effluents and accidents  minimize the use of virgin materials and nonrenewable forms of energy and  minimize the lifecycle cost cradle to grave of products or services green use of raw materials growing concerns over depletion of forests and other natural resources and environmental degradation created by mining and fossil fuel production remarked hart suggest that corporations may need to rethink their raw material and procurement strategies significant sectors of the business community—especially large corporations engaged in the lumber and energy industries—continue to take issue with such sentiments arguing that resources remain plentiful but many other businesses citing the findings of both the scientific and environmental communities or the internal data of their marketing arms have begun to make changes in the ways that they gather raw materials for their products reliance on recyclable or renewable materials new energy and material conservation initiatives and replenishment programs such as forest replanting programs have all been touted as effective tools in establishing processes that do not unduly harm the environment green manufacturingproduction processes information from industry studies and consumer research is being used to develop new products and to redesign existing products and services in order to reduce their impact on the environment in its book green products by design the us office of technology assessment ota advocated green design as a thoroughly viable goal in which environmental attributes are treated as design objectives rather than as constraints… green design incorporates environmental objectives with minimum loss to product performance useful life or functionality in fact supporters of green production assert that it makes financial sense for businesses of all sizes and shapes to undertake the process of green design wasteful and polluting throughput processes lead to inefficient use of material and human resources as well as occupational and public health risks wrote hart in northwest environmental journal just as the zerodefects goal in quality control demands preventative action and continuous improvement at every production step a zerowaste goal can focus efforts toward the virtual elimination of pollution this preventative approach has proven far more efficient than efforts aimed at controlling discharges at the end of the pipe corporations are realizing that pollution prevention can be a cost saving activity eg by lowering compliance waste treatment disposal and raw material costs subsequently some businesses have increasingly steered their product and packaging designs to use less materials or to be easily disassembled so that highvalue components can be recycled or refurbished more readily analysts generally agree that product packaging is one of the most visible and important elements of an environmentally sensitive production operation examples of green packaging include the use of recycled content in packaging materials source reduction and refill alternatives whatever form the packaging takes it should clearly state whether green claims pertain to the product or to its package if the particular environmental quality that is lauded applies only to a portion or component of the product or packaging this fact must also be clearly indicated explained shi and kane for example a manufacturer of aluminum foil displays a recyclable claim on a box of aluminum foil with no qualifications but if only the foil and not the box is recyclable the claim is deceptive the manufacturer must instead distinguish between the product and the packaging in claiming such recyclability the exception to this rule is when only a minor incidental component of the product or packaging is not recyclable the environmentally sustainable company as shrivastava and hart remarked in greening organizations companies that wish to embrace green production philosophies and processes after years of indifference usually have to redesign significant aspects of the business including its mission and vision competitive strategies core technological systems performance measurement and reward systems and organizational processes and culture of course this task is more formidable for larger companies than it is for small and midsized firms of the above elements of a business perhaps none is more important than mission and vision for all the other aspects of the organization are fundamentally shaped by those values but while the process of establishing a green production company can be quite daunting proponents argue that cost savings associated with pollution prevention efforts coupled with marketplace benefits in the realms of reputation and consumer loyalty can make the shift a beneficial one not only for the environment but also for the company itself small business and green production although most media attention on green production has been directed at the efforts of big corporations increasing numbers of small companies have successfully established ecologically sensitive business practices as well indeed some small companies operate in regions or industries that are ideally suited to green production many companies that provide goods equipment and clothing manufacturers or services retail stores guiding services to backpackers anglers mountain bikers canoeists kayakers campers and other aficionados of the outdoors are very careful to operate in environmentally friendly ways similarly companies that operate in geographical regions that are very supportive of environmental protection may well publicize their use of green production methods and philosophies the marketplace goodwill that can be realized in such situations should not be underestimated small business consultants meanwhile counsel their clients to carefully research the obligations that a commitment to green production entails before making any decision smaller businesses sometimes have difficulty securing the necessary financing to switch physical operations to a green production mode moreover jumps in other operating costs as a result of changes to green production methods sometimes result in higher prices for customers and subsequent drops in sales while larger companies can usually shrug off such ripple effects with ease smaller businesses are often less able to do so but consultants acknowledge that green production methods can boost business as well increasing sales while decreasing production costs indeed proponents argue that for many small businesses—and especially new ventures which do not have previously established modes of operation—green production can be a rewarding business philosophy further reading green products by design

neuroscience and biological psychology branches social psychology for students glossary view all whats more important in determining life success—book smarts or street smarts this question gets at the heart of an important debate contrasting the relative importance of cognitive intelligence iq and emotional intelligence eq proponents of the socalled book smarts might suggest that it is our iq that plays the critical role in determining how well people fair in life those who advocate for the importance of what might be called street smarts would instead suggest that eq is even more important so which is itunderstanding the iq vs eq debatein his  book emotional intelligence author and psychologist daniel goleman suggested that eq or emotional intelligence quotient might actually be more important than iq why some psychologists believe that standard measures of intelligence ie iq scores are too narrow and do not encompass the full range of human intelligencethe psychologist howard gardner for example has suggested that intelligence is not simply a single general ability instead he suggests that there are actually multiple intelligences and that people may have strengths in a number of these areasinstead of focusing on a single general intelligence usually referred to as the g factor some experts believe that the ability to understand and express emotions can play an equal if not even more important role in how people fare in lifewhats the difference between iq and eqhow are iq and eq measured and tested lets start by defining the two terms in order to understand what they mean and how they differ iq or intelligence quotient is a number derived from a standardized intelligence test on the original iq tests scores were calculated by dividing the individuals mental age by his or her chronological age and then multiplying that number by  so a child with a mental age of  and a chronological age of  would have an iq of  today scores on most iq tests are calculated by comparing the test takers score to the scores of other people in the same age groupiq represents abilities such asvisual and spatial processingknowledge of the worldfluid reasoningworking memory and shortterm memoryquantitative reasoningeq on the other hand is a measure of a persons level of emotional intelligence this refers to a persons ability to perceive control evaluate and express emotions researchers such as john mayer and peter salovey as well as writers like daniel goleman have helped shine a light on emotional intelligence making it a hot topic in areas ranging from business management to educationeq is centered on abilities such asidentifying emotionsevaluating how others feelcontrolling ones own emotionsperceiving how others feelusing emotions to facilitate social communicationrelating to otherssince the s emotional intelligence has made the journey from a semiobscure concept found in academic journals to a popularly recognized term today you can buy toys that claim to help boost a childs emotional intelligence or enroll your kids in social and emotional learning sel programs designed to teach emotional intelligence skills  in some schools in the united states social and emotional learning is even a curriculum requirementso which one is more importantat one point in time iq was viewed as the primary determinant of success people with high iqs were assumed to be destined for a life of accomplishment and achievement and researchers debated whether intelligence was the product of genes or the environment the old nature versus nurture debate however some critics began to realize that not only was high intelligence no guarantee for success in life it was also perhaps too narrow a concept to fully encompass the wide range of human abilities and knowledge iq is still recognized as an important element of success particularly when it comes to academic achievement people with high iqs typically to do well in school often earn more money and tend to be healthier in general but today experts recognize it is not the only determinate of life success instead it is part of a complex array of influences that includes emotional intelligence among other thingsthe concept of emotional intelligence has had a strong impact in a number of areas including the business world many companies now mandate emotional intelligence training and utilize eq tests as part of the hiring process research has found that individuals with strong leadership potential also tend to be more emotionally intelligent suggesting that a high eq is an important quality for business leaders and managers to havefor example one insurance company discovered that eq could play a vital role in sales success sales agents who ranked lower on emotional intelligence abilities such as empathy initiative and selfconfidence were found to sell policies with an average premium of  for comparison those agents who ranked highly on measures of eq sold policies worth an average of emotional abilities can also influence the choices that consumer make when confronted with buying decisions nobelprize winning psychologist daniel kahneman has found that people would rather deal with a person that they trust and like rather than someone they do not even if that means paying more for an inferior productcan you learn emotional intelligenceso you might be wondering if emotional intelligence is so important can it be taught or strengthened according to one metaanalysis that looked at the results of social and emotional learning programs the answer to that question is an unequivocal yes the study found that approximately  percent of kids enrolled in sel programs had better achievement scores and almost  percent showed improved gradepointaverages these programs were also linked to lowered suspension rates increased school attendance and reduced disciplinary problemssome strategies for teaching emotional intelligence include offering character education modeling positive behaviors encouraging people to think about how others are feeling and finding ways to be more empathetic toward othersa word from verywelllife success is a result of many factors both iq and eq undoubtedly play roles in influencing your overall success as well as things such as health wellness and happiness rather than focusing on which factors might have a more dominant influence the greatest benefit may lie in learning to improve skills in multiple areasin addition to strengthening certain cognitive abilities such as your memory and mental focus you can also acquire new social and emotional skills that will serve you well in many different areas of your lifesourcesgoleman d emotional intelligence why it can matter more

credit getty images i recently posted an infographic that provided a view of personality traits versus intelligence levels as indicators of success  i decided to let it stand on its own because i believe it does have some value however the infographic also contains some seriously fuzzy thinking that might lead readers astray therefore im using this post to pull the infographic apart and to see where it falls badly short the infographic has three sections  a premise  a list and  a conclusion so for claritys sake ill address each of these elements separately intelligence versus personality the setup for the infographic states that some personality factors are more important than intelligent level  but what does this mean exactly does intelligent levels mean iq intelligence quotient or does it mean level of intellectual skill gained over time this is an important distinction  iq measures potential not performance relevant intellectual skill by contrast is crucial to many jobs for example an employee with an iq of  whos skilled in literary criticism is less likely to be useful than an employee with an iq of  whos mastered objectoriented programming this is true even if both employees are autistic or even if the employee with the higher iq is charismatic and the employee with the lower iq is a dullard skills matter the premise then quotes a psychologists list of the personality factors more valuable than intelligence levels  while make sense the fifth extraversion is absurd as ive pointed out previously extraverts are at a disadvantage in a business world where most of the interaction takes place online the only place where extraversion is an advantage are in open offices which are designed to promote social interaction while reducing actual productivity the premise then quotes a study showing that  financial success is generated from people skills while  is from technical knowledge  what does that mean exactly a person with zero technical knowledge has little hope of becoming successful while many entrepreneursbill gates comes to mindare definitely not peoplepeople the premise ends with a summary intelligence it seems can only take you so far hard work and social skill development are the keys to reaching the topthis sudden appearance of hard work is odd because its the first indication that effort might be required  ill have more to say about this later the  personality traits i agree that all eight of these traits are important  however the trait of passion is a bit misleading and even a bet dangerous in practice a common business mistake is to wrongly believe that passion is contagious that expressing your passion for your job company or product will make other people passionate about it too in fact your personal enthusiasm is irrelevant to other people except insofar as the lack of it might indicate incompetence in fact gushing about your passion can come off gladhanding and even make you seem untrustworthy especially if its not backed by competence and intellectual skill the overall problem here though is that these traits continually blur the concept of potential versus actualization   for example any parent of multiple children knows that some children are better than others at keeping their temper ie selfregulation   nevertheless unless a child is seriously impaired any child can learn to stop throwing tantrums another problem is the catchall social skills  by definition skills arent traits theyre something thats learned  some people find social interaction easy others find it more difficult  such skills build on potential but they arent the same thing as potential the final statement of this this section that the possession of social skills ultimately means success is completely absurd there are plenty of failures who have great social skills  the tv show better call saul for instance is a excellent character study of such a person  for some jobs indeed many jobs developing requisite intellectual skills are as important or more important than social skills  empty suits can only rise so far after a while people want to see some brains behind the fancy talk the conclusion the final segment of the infographic brings its limitations to the forefront by stating that intelligence cant be taught but personality traits can be developed and enhanced   but thats ridiculous  of course intelligence can be taught that why we attend school read books and so forth  what cant be altered is iq but thats potential not actualization what cant be taught is personality traits which is eq which measures potential rather than actualization  just as some people have a high iq some people have a higher eq and therefore find people skills easier whats important isnt so much your iq or your eq but what you decide to do with whatever potential youve got  thomas edison put it perfectly when he said success is  percent inspiration and  percent perspiration like this column sign up to
