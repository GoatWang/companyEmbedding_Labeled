november  learn how and when to remove this template message in business and engineering new product development npd covers the complete process of bringing a new product to market new product development is described in the literaturewhich as the transformation of a market opportunity into a product available for sale the product can be tangible something physical which one can touch or intangible like a service experience or belief a good understanding of customer needs and wants of the competitive environment and of the nature of the market represents the top required factor for the success of a new product cost time and quality are the main variables that drive customer needs aiming at these three variables companies develop continuous practices and strategies to better satisfy customer requirements and to increase their own market share by a regular development of new productscitation needed there are many uncertainties and challenges which companies must face throughout the process the use of best practices and the elimination of barriers to communication are the main concerns for the management of the npd processcitation needed contents  process structure  models  marketing considerations  fuzzy front end  other approaches  organizations  strategies  management  related fields  see also  references process structureedit the product development process typically consists of several activities that firms employ in the complex process of delivering new products to the market a process management approach is used to provide a structure for npd consistency and to enable continuous improvement every new product will pass through a series of stages from ideation through design manufacturing and market introduction in highly engineered products aircraft automotive machinery that deals with complexity the npd process passes through phases milestones and deliverables management requiring an equally complex organizational system to manage the process the more complex the product the more complex the npd process and management system complex npd processes especially in military aircraft projects use an integrated product team approach the process for managing large sale complex engineering products is much slower  plus years than that deployed for fast moving consumer goods weeks the product development process basically has four main phases fuzzy frontend ffe is the set of activities employed before the formal and well defined requirements specification is completed requirements are a highlevel view of what the product should do to meet the perceived market or business need product design is the development of both the highlevel and detailedlevel design of the product which turns the what of the requirements into a specific how this particular product will meet those requirements on the marketing and planning side this phase ends at precommercialization analysisclarification needed stage product implementation is the phase of detailed engineering design of mechanical or electrical hardware or the software engineering of software or embedded software or design of soft goods or other product forms as well as of any test process that may be used to validate that the prototype objects actually meet the design specification and the requirements specification that was previously agreed to fuzzy backend or commercialization phase represent the action steps where the production and market launch occur the frontend marketing phases have been very well researched with valuable models proposed peter koen et al provides a fivestep frontend activity called frontend innovation opportunity identification opportunity analysis idea genesis idea selection and idea and technology development he also includes an engine in the middle of the five frontend stages and the possible outside barriers that can influence the process outcome the engine represents the management driving the activities described the front end of the innovation is the greatest area of weakness in the npd process this is mainly because the ffe is often chaotic unpredictable and unstructureddead link engineering design is the process whereby a technical solution is developed iteratively to solve a given problem the design stage is very important because at this stage most of the product life cycle costs are engaged previous research shows that – of the final product quality and  of the product entire lifecycle cost are determined in the product design phase therefore the designmanufacturing interface represent the greatest opportunity for cost reduction design projects last from a few weeks to three years with an average of one year design and commercialization phases usually start a very early collaboration when the concept design is finished it will be sent to manufacturing plant for prototyping developing a concurrent engineering approach by implementing practices such as qfd dfmdfa and more the output of the design engineering is a set of product and process specifications – mostly in the form of drawings and the output of manufacturing is the product ready for sale basically the design team will develop drawings with technical specifications representing the future product and will send it to the manufacturing plant to be executed solving productprocess fit problems is of high priority in information communication design because  of the development effort must be scrapped if any changes are made after the release to manufacturing modelsedit conceptual models have been designed in order to facilitate a smooth process the concept adopted by ideo a successful design and consulting firm is one of the most researched processes in regard to new product development and is a fivestep procedure these steps are listed in chronological order understand and observe the market the client the technology and the limitations of the problem synthesize the information collected at the first step visualise new customers using the product prototype evaluate and improve the concept implementation of design changes which are associated with more technologically advanced procedures and therefore this step will require more time one of the first developed models that today companies still use in the npd process is the booz allen and hamilton bah model published in  this is the best known model because it underlies the npd systems that have been put forward later this model represent the foundation of all the other models that have been developed afterwards significant work has been conducted in order to propose better models but in fact these models can be easily linked to bah model the seven steps of bah model are new product strategy idea generation screening and evaluation business analysis development testing and commercialization a pioneer of npd research in the consumers goods sector is robert g cooper over the last two decades he conducted significant work in the area of npd the stagegate model developed in the s was proposed as a new tool for managing new products development processes this was mainly applied to the consumers goods industry the  apqc benchmarking study reveals that  of us businesses employ a stagegate system to manage new products from idea to launch in return the companies that adopt this system are reported to receive benefits such as improved teamwork shorter cycle time improved success rates earlier detection of failure a better launch and even shorter cycle times – reduced by about  these findings highlight the importance of the stagegate model in the area of new product development over the last few years the lean startup movement has grown in popularity challenging many of the assumptions inherent in the stagegate model marketing considerationsedit there have been a number of approaches proposed for analyzing and responding to the marketing challenges of new product development two of these are the eight stages process of peter koen of the stevens institute of technology and a process known as the fuzzy front end fuzzy front endedit the fuzzy front end ffe is the messy getting started period of new product engineering development processes it is in the front end where the organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea it is the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged ready to enter the structured development process kim and wilemon  koen et al  it includes all activities from the search for new opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of a precise concept the fuzzy front end phase ends when an organization approves and begins formal development of the concept although the fuzzy front end may not be an expensive part of product development it can consume  of development time see chapter  of the smith and reinertsen reference below and it is where major commitments are typically made involving time money and the products nature thus setting the course for the entire project and final end product consequently this phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than something that happens before development and its cycle time should be included in the total development cycle time koen et al distinguish five different frontend elements not necessarily in a particular order opportunity identification opportunity analysis idea genesis idea selection idea and technology development the first element is the opportunity identification in this element large or incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less structured way using the guidelines established here resources will eventually be allocated to new projects which then lead to a structured nppd new product  process development strategy the second element is the opportunity analysis it is done to translate the identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology specific context of the company here extensive efforts may be made to align ideas to target customer groups and do market studies andor technical trials and research the third element is the idea genesis which is described as evolutionary and iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into a tangible idea the process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come from outside inputs eg a supplier offering a new materialtechnology or from a customer with an unusual request the fourth element is the idea selection its purpose is to choose whether to pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value the fifth element is the idea and technology development during this part of the frontend the business case is developed based on estimates of the total available market customer needs investment requirements competition analysis and project uncertainty some organizations consider this to be the first stage of the nppd process ie stage  the fuzzy front end is also described in literatureby whom as front end of innovation phase  stage  or preprojectactivitiescitation needed a universally acceptable definition for fuzzy front end or a dominant framework has not been developed so far in a glossary of pdma it is mentioned that the fuzzy front end generally consists of three tasks strategic planning idea generation and especially pretechnical evaluation these activities are often chaotic unpredictable and unstructured in comparison the subsequent new product development process is typically structured predictable and formal the term fuzzy front end was first popularized by smith and reinertsen  rg cooper  describes the early stages of nppd as a fourstep process in which ideas are generated i subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment ii and merged to coherent product concepts iii which are finally judged for their fit with existing product strategies and portfolios iv other approachesedit other authors have divided predevelopment product development activities differently preliminary technical assessment sourceofsupply assessment suppliers and partners or alliances market research market size and segmentation analysis voc voice of the customer research product idea testing customer value assessment product definition business and financial analysis these activities yield essential information to make a gonogo to development decision one of the earliestcitation needed studies using the case study method defined the frontend to include the interrelated activities of product strategy formulation and communication opportunity identification and assessment idea generation product definition project planning executive reviews economical analysis benchmarking of competitive products and modeling and prototyping are also important activities during the frontend activities the outcomes of ffe are thecitation needed mission statement customer needs details of the selected idea product definition and specifications economic analysis of the product the development schedule project staffing and the budget a business plan aligned with corporate strategy a conceptual model of frontend process was proposed which includes early phases of the innovation process this model is structured in three phases and three gates phase  environmental screening or opportunity identification stage in which external changes will be analysed and translated into potential business opportunities phase  preliminary definition of an idea or concept phase  detailed product project or service definition and business planning the gates are opportunity screening idea evaluation gonogo for development the final gate leads to a dedicated new product development project many professionals and academics consider that the general features of fuzzy front end fuzziness ambiguity and uncertainty make it difficult to see the ffe as a structured process but rather as a set of interdependent activities  eg kim and wilemon  however husig et al   argue that frontend not need to be fuzzy but can be handled in a structured manner in fact carbone  showed that when using the front end success factors in an integrated process product success is increased peter koen argues that in the ffe for incremental platform and radical projects three separate strategies and processes are typically involved the traditional stage gate tm process was designed for incremental product development namely for a single product the ffe for developing a new platform must start out with a strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will lead to a family of products projects for breakthrough products start out with a similar strategic vision but are associated with technologies which require new discoveries incremental platform and breakthrough products include incremental products are considered to be cost reductions improvements to existing product lines additions to existing platforms and repositioning of existing products introduced in markets breakthrough products are new to the company or new to the world and offer a  times or greater improvement in performance combined with a  or greater reduction in costs platform products establish a basic architecture for a next generation product or process and are substantially larger in scope and resources than incremental projects organizationsedit product development and
