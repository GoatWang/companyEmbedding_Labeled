office all disclosures of the document named above is incorporated herein by referencebackground of the invention field of the inventionthe present disclosure relates to a three dimensional d virtual image modeling method for an object produced through a semiconductor or a planar display panel manufacturing process and more particularly to a d virtual image modeling method which automatically generates a d structure by using sequences in which depositionetching are performed and mask data description of the related artsimulation or modeling performed during a product development process prior to actual development of products has been continuously researched and developed as a way to reduce errors and save overall expenses and accompanied with advancing computer system technology it has been provided with remarkable enhancement as a modeling method using computing programs for example autocad or solidworks are examples of commercial products that utilize d modeling method these indeed provide resultant products with such a high level of quality that they are widely used in manufacturing siteshowever situations are somewhat different when designing products in a semiconductor or tft display manufacturing process this process actually involves repeated deposition and etching in which shape is determined based on a mask basically but then thickness and angles of inclinations are finally determined according to characteristics of materials and time of exposurea conventional method of designing an object produced through a semiconductor or display manufacturing process involves generating a d structure by using plane shape d data of a mask and then adding depth information to the d cad drawinghowever since the processes are performed such that respective d structures are accumulated stacking is not possible with a method of adding depth to the d mask plane in other words the process requires an operation of modifying d structure of a next layer stacked above according to the shape of an underlying surface and matching of respective adjacent surfaces is then necessary for the meshing operation for d simulation conventionally an operator can directly edit when shapes are simple but as semiconductor integration and complexity is accelerated patterns and depositionetching processes become more complicated to the extent that it is not possible to perform d modeling with the conventional method anymoremeanwhile in order to automate modeling of objects produced through a semiconductor or display manufacturing process boolean engine and so on can be used but it takes lengthy time due to high complexity and also in view of matching errors related with floating points or inclined surfaces are highly likely to occursummary of the inventiontechnical probleman object of the present disclosure is to solve the problems mentioned above and accordingly it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a d virtual shape modeling

anticipatedbrief description of the drawingsfig  is a flowchart provided to explain a d modeling method according to an exemplary embodimentfig  is a flowchart provided to explain operation at s of fig fig  is a view exemplifying a model formed by d modelingfig  is a view provided to explain a method for modeling the third layer of fig  andfig  is a view provided to explain a method for generating a projection diagram of the third layer of fig detailed description of the embodimentshereinbelow exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawingsa method according to an exemplary embodiment is performed for example on a computer apparatus that performs d shape modeling of an object produced by a semiconductor process so that a virtual d shape as a result of modeling is displayed through a display and so ona d modeling method illustrated in fig  is applicable to any d modeling that basically utilizes a semiconductor process for example it is applicable to not only semiconductor chip designing but also d modeling of a planar display panel fabricated with semiconductor processas noted above a semiconductor process involves forming of a structure with deposition and etching processes in which thickness and shape are determined according to the depositionetching method and characteristics of a material the process can be described as two processes of stacking generated layers as below  the first stacking of a layer formed by deposition process and  another stacking of a layer formed by deposition and etching for example fig  illustrates a semiconductor in which first to third layers    are stacked on a substrate  the first layer  is formed on the substrate  by deposition and the second and third layers   are each formed by maskingmeanwhile a model element for use in modeling a structure in a d virtual space simply ‘space’ defined by xyz axes includes a node or point an edge or side a polygon and a polyhedron using this combined information of the model element d shape information is generated and by performing rendering based on such information a model that is visually observable by an operator is displayed through a display such as a computer and so onthe term ‘node’ as used herein refers to a position in the space and the ‘edge’ is used as a constituent element of a polygon one polygon may be defined with the node and edge information the nodes and edges shared by the adjoining polygons are shared by each of such polygons the ‘polyhedron’ refers to one single mass in the space formed of a plurality of polygons and object information name or index is set for the polyhedronhereinafter a modeling method according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to fig determining modeling region sa ‘bottom region’ of an object or structure as a subject of modeling is determined on xy plane through subsequent processes a structure is stacked on the bottom region in zaxis directionlayer by deposition sthe first layer  of fig  is an example of a layer that is formed solely by the deposition the layer is applied entirely on the bottom region or preceding layer this step relates to first forming a polyhedron by imparting a vertical thickness to a specific polygon after which combining with the bottom region or precious layer is followed at s accordingly necessary data includes information of polygon to be used information of layers thickness and object information of a corresponding layerthe modeling completes a polyhedron by positioning a polygon on xy plane parallelcopying by the thickness in zaxis direction and then generating a side surface based on the edges all of the polyhedrons formed in this step are basic polyhedrons with flat bottom and top surfaceslayer formed by deposition and etching sthe layer such as the second layer  or the third layer  of fig  is a layer that is formed by deposition combined with etching referring to fig a a basic polyhedron a is first formed and then at s transformed to conform to the shape of the preceding layer and combined accordingly this step involves forming a basic polyhedron by  first determining a thickness of a polyhedron applied in the deposition and  then determining a shape determined by the etching by masking accordingly necessary data includes object information polygon information layer thickness information and mask informationthe mask information includes a mask shape and a ‘maskedge cross section information’ the mask shape may use graphic database system gds format the ‘maskedge cross section information’ refers to information of a cross section at every edge of a shape formed by a mask due to limited technology the cross section in the etching process has a certain slope rather than being vertically formed at the edge of the mask such slope may be determined by the hardness of the material time of exposure and so on accordingly the maskedge cross section information may be defined by whether a corresponding edge has a certain slope or is planar whether the corresponding edge is a curved surface having a positive curvature convex shape or a negative curvature concave shape or depending on examples a userdefined curve may be applied an angle of slope is sufficient for a planar surface the curvature information is necessary for a curve having one curvature and node information and curvature of each curved surface will be necessary for an example where a plurality of curved surfaces are connectedthe process of forming a layer at s will be described again below based on fig completing modeling s sthe layer previously formed through s or s is combined on the bottom region determined at s and then at s the process of combining a new layer on a preceding layer is repeatedly performed while operations at s and s are repeatedthe combining process at s varies depending on the shape of the preceding layer for example for the layer such as the first layer  or the second layer  that are combined with the flat substrate  the combining process involves simple overlaying however the second layer  on which the third layer  will be overlain is not flat the basic polygon is segmented and combined this process will be described with reference to fig  belowwhen the process of stacking each layer of the semiconductor is completed by s to s at s an image is rendered by using final combining information so that a d model is completed and displayed and the d modeling process is completedwith the method described above an operator does not have to manually complete each layer to complete a d modeling because the operator simply can input necessary datahereinafter the process of forming a layer by deposition and etching in s to s will be described with reference to figs  to  for convenience of explanation the process of forming the third layer  of fig  will be described as an example as described above the second layer  and the third layer  are formed by performing deposition first and then partial removal by etching note that because the third layer  is stacked on the previouslyformed second layer  the layers cannot be at the same height as a reference plane but formed with a stepped portion according to the shape of the second layer the modeling process involves forming a basic polyhedron a having a masking shape such as the one illustrated in fig a and then forming this into a final polyhedron  as the one illustrated in fig b according to the shape of a preceding layer in this process processing a d shape such as the basic polyhedron a of fig a will be very difficult and complicated according to an exemplary embodiment a projected form of a d polyhedron on a plane ie a ‘projection diagram’ of a d polyhedron is created and then this d projection diagram is segmented according to the shape of the preceding layer and then a d layer shape is generated by applying height information of the preceding layer to the segmented projection diagramaccordingly the modeling involves  generating projection diagram of a basic polyhedron s to s  segmenting projection diagram s and  expanding in z axis s the operation  corresponds to s and operations  and  correspond to sgenerating projection diagram of a basic polyhedron s to sgenerating projection diagram of a basic polyhedron includes first extracting a shape of a layer from the mask information and generating a bottom surface  of the basic polyhedron a of fig  as illustrated in fig a at s because it is before segmentation the bottom surface  is a planeafter computing the bottom surface  the top surface  is generated as illustrated in fig b during etching inclination is generated between the bottom surface  and the top surface  and the information of such inclined surface is extracted from the maskedge cross section information it is assumed herein that the inclined surface is a plane having a certain slope accordingly if a portion where the inclined surface is projected vertically on the bottom surface  is called an inclined portion it is assumed that the top surface  of the polyhedron is the region excluding the inclined portion from the bottom surface  accordingly the top surface  is a polygon having an edge size reduced by the d boolean engine or boolean operation by a distance in consideration of a thickness of the top surface  and a slope extracted from the maskedge cross section informationafter the bottom surface  and the top surface  are generated through s and s nodes corresponding to the bottom surface  and the top surface  are paired with each other and an edge  connecting these nodes is generated to thus generate a side surface  accordingly the projection diagram  is completed referring to fig c the projection diagram  is defined as a polyhedron having the bottom surface  the top surface  and the side surface  all existing on a plane this projection diagram  is the information of the polyhedron on a plane ie before expansion in the z axis direction meanwhile at s when two edges of the bottom surface  or top surface  connected with each other are at an acute or obtuse angle rather than ° by the edge processing the number of nodes may increase or decrease in which case the connection between the top surface  and the bottom surface  may have  or  node connection so that the side surface  is in a triangular shapesegmenting projection diagram of basic polyhedron ssegmenting a projection diagram involves projecting the projection diagram  generated at s to s onto a previously stacked layer ie onto the second layer  and segmenting the same the boolean engine is used when segmenting the projection diagramthe boolean engine is widely used in the computer graphic field and it performs operations including merging at least one polygonal sets or segmenting the same by performing operations such as and not and so on between the projection diagram  and the preceding layer the projection diagram  is segmented according to the shape of the preceding layer and node information is added according to the segmentationcompleting layer swhen the projection diagram segmented at s is completed deposition process is reproduced in a manner such that d bend matching the preceding layer is applied to the bottom surface  by applying the height information applied to the preceding layer and the top surface  is moved in the z axis by the height applied to the third layer  and positionedthrough the process described above layer modeling is performed as the layers are completed by deposition and etchingas described above the process of segmenting in a manner of projecting a plane image onto a space allows the overall computation to be simple it is practically complicated to actually realize the computation that can establish a stack on a nonflat structure three dimensionally based on completed polyhedrons and there also will be reduced stabilitythe foregoing exemplary embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the exemplary embodiments the present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses also the description of the exemplary embodiments of the present inventive concept is intended to be illustrative and not to limit the scope of the claims   previous
