more than  years ago thailand started industrialization from an agricultural society initially many industries had production capacity only sufficient for domestic use in order to decrease imports afterwards the industries started developing for export purposes but were hardly successful due to low production capacity and unreliable product quality caused by out of date machines and insufficient personnel skillful in efficient machine control at the same time many industries in developed countries had focused in developing technology innovation through application of automation machinery in manufacturing process in addition the hot weather and humidity of thailand caused unreliability to control the machines therefore international technical support was necessary to solve problems and improve productivity resulting in high cost and delays due to the travelling cpt drives and power public company limited established in  set up by an experienced thai engineering team
