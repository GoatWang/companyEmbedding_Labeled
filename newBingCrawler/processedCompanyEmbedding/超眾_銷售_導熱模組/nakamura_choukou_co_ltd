software customization customer profile comment from yutaka watanabe section chief management division we needed to quickly create a system to manage mass production with which we had no experience and building one from scratch would involve huge risks but instead of going with a package software we had contec develop a solution and make a proposal based on our products and operations starting from the estimate stage at the time we created an outline design that we were unsure of and didnt allow us to envision the final shape of the manufacturing management however we worked together with contec to construct a system while taking our concerns into consideration they supported us during the system construction and even now where operations are at more than  times the production volume we have no problems with operation and have been able to add new functions we look forward to continue working with them in the future as the ultimate partner for system construction nakamura choukou
