health and human servicespublic health servicefood and drug administration  paint branch parkwaycollege park md   december   warning letter via express delivery  osaki suisan co ltd kusatsukoh  chomenishikuosaka japan                                        re  dear sirmadam in march  an importer in the united states mutual trading company inc requested removal from import alert  “detention without physical examination of fish and fishery products for import and foreign processor manuf combinations” this importer was listed on import alert  with your firm osaki suisan co ltd as part of the evidence provided with the request for removal from the alert mutual trading company inc submitted to the us food and drug administration a copy of your firm’s seafood hazard analysis and critical control point haccp plan for your fish cake along with a copy of your hazard analysis and the product flow diagram for this product our evaluation of your haccp plan copy attached and supporting information found that this plan has serious deviations from the requirements of the seafood haccp regulation title  code of federal regulations part   cfr  in accordance with  cfr g failure of a processor to have and implement a haccp plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of  cfr part  renders the fishery products adulterated within the meaning of section a of the us federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc a accordingly your firm’s fish cake product isadulterated within the meaning of the act in that the producthasbeen prepared packed or held under conditions whereby itmay have been rendered injurious to health  you may find the act the seafood haccp regulation and the th edition of the fish and fisheries products hazards  controls guidance the hazards guide through links in fdas home page at wwwfdagov  the hazards guide can be found on our web site at httpwwwfdagovfoodguidancecomplianceregulatoryinformationguidancedocumentsseafoodfishandfisheriesproductshazardsandcontrolsguidedefaulthtm we found the following serious deviations     you must have a haccp plan that lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur to comply with  cfr c a food safety hazard is defined in  cfr f as any biological chemical or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption however your firm’s haccp plan for fish cake does not list the following food safety hazards a    clostridium botulinum growth and toxin formation  information provided in the process flow diagram hazard analysis and the haccp plan reveal that your firm is vacuum packaging the fish cakes vacuum packaging finished products creates an environment conducive to clostridium botulinum growth and toxin formation consequently your firm needs to identify this hazard in your haccp plan once your firm has identified clostridium botulinum growth and toxin formation in your haccp plan your firm needs to adopt an adequate control strategy to prevent toxin formation for example fda recommends either i    conducting a pasteurization process adequate to achieve a d process to inactivate clostridium botulinum your firm’s haccp plan includes a “b” critical control point however the critical limit listed as “b” is not adequate to achieve d process to inactivate clostridium botulinum because the core temperature is below the minimum necessary to control toxin formation and because there is no corresponding critical limit for time for example fda recommends a pasteurization process that achieves at a minimum an internal product temperature of °c for  minutes established by a scientific study under worse case conditions ie to ensure that the largest fish cake with the lowest initial temperature in each batch achieves the minimum process  or ii    freezing the products immediately following the heat sterilization step your firm’s process flow chart references a freezing step and your haccp plan indicates that the intended method of storage and distribution of these products as “b” for vacuumpackaged products intended to be stored and distributed frozen fda recommends that firms add a critical control point in the plan to ensure that each batch of labels includes handling instructions to keep frozen to control clostridium botulinum growth and toxin formation additional handling instructions should also include instructions to thaw under refrigeration immediately before use  b    undeclared allergens    finfish are a major food allergen and consequently a food safety hazard that must be identified in your haccp plan additionally other allergenic ingredients such as eggs or wheat should be addressed in your haccp plan when necessary we suggest that processors conduct a visual examination of their labels prior to use by comparing the label with product ingredients to ensure that all allergenic ingredients are accurately declared in the ingredient statement     you must have a haccp plan that at a minimum lists the critical limits that must be met to comply with  cfr c a critical limit is defined in  cfr c as the maximum or minimum value to which a physical biological or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard   however your firm’s haccp plan for fish cake lists critical limits for temperatures at the “b” critical control points that are not adequate to control the identified food safety hazard of pathogen growth  your plan lists a critical limit temperature of b however for general pathogens or for vacuumpackaged products that receive a pasteurization process adequate to inactivate clostridium botulinum fda recommends a critical limit temperature of ° c or below for vacuumpackaged products where the pasteurization process is not adequate to inactivate clostridium botulinum fda recommends a critical limit temperature of °c or below     you must have a haccp plan that at a minimum lists monitoring procedures and their frequency for each critical control point to comply with  cfr c however your firm’s haccp plan for fish cake lists a monitoring frequency at the “b” critical control point that is not adequate to control the identified hazard of pathogen growth and toxin formation specifically the monitoring frequency listed in the plan as “b” does not provide an adequate frequency fda recommends the following when monitoring end process internal product temperatures a    for batch cooking or pasteurization equipment monitoring each batchb    for continuous cooking or pasteurization equipment monitoring at least every  minutes and whenever any changes in productheating critical factors occur  if you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate we may take further action for instance we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under section a of the act  usc §a including placing them on detention without physical examination dwpe fda’s dwpe is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the united states may be detained without physical examination upon entry dwpe information may be conveyed in fda’s import alerts for your information an example of an import alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood haccp regulation is import alert  you may view this alert at httpwwwaccessdatafdagovcmsiaialisthtml you should respond in writing within  working days from your receipt of this letter your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations more specifically your response should include documentation such as a copy of any revised haccp plan or plans at least five  product days worth of monitoring records complete sets for each of the five day’s worth of records to demonstrate that you have implemented the revised plans any verification records and any other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections if you cannot complete all corrections within  days you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations this letter may not list all the deviations at your facility you are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the act and all applicable regulations including the seafood haccp regulation and the good manufacturing practice regulation  cfr  you also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the act and all applicable regulations please send your reply to food
