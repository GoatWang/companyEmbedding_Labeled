development rtd is activities in connection with corporate or government innovation research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product rd activities differ from institution to institution with two primary modelscitation needed of an rd department either staffed by engineers and tasked with directly developing new products or staffed with industrial scientists and tasked with applied research in scientific or technological fields which may facilitate future product development rd differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profitcitation needed and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment however rd is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketization of new products contents  background  business  benefit by sector  government expenditures  united states  european union  see also  notes and references backgroundedit new product design and development is more often than not a crucial factor in the survival of a company in a global industrial landscape that is changing fast firms must continually revise their design and range of products this is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers without an rd program a firm must rely on strategic alliances acquisitions and networks to tap into the innovations of others a system driven by marketing is one that puts the customer needs first and produces goods that are known to sellcitation needed market research is carried out which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential niche market of a new product if the development is technology driven rd is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needscitation needed in general research and development activities are conducted by specialized units or centers belonging to a company or can be outsourced to a contract research organization universities or state agenciescitation needed in the context of commerce research and development normally refers to futureoriented longerterm activities in science or technology using similar techniques to scientific research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yieldcitation needed statistics on organizations devoted to rd may express the state of an industry the degree of competition or the lure of progresscitation needed some common measures include budgets numbers of patents or on rates of peerreviewed publications bank ratios are one of the best measures because they are continuously maintained public and reflect riskcitation needed in the united states a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial company is about  of revenues this measure is called rd intensitycitation needed a high technology company such as a computer manufacturer might spend  or a pharmaceutical companies such as merck  co  or novartis  anything over  is remarkable and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as engineering company ericsson  or allergan a biotech company tops the spending table with  investment such companies are often seen as credit risks because their spending ratios are so unusualcitation needed generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme high technology needs like certain prescription drugs or special chemicals scientific instruments and safetycritical systems in medicine aeronautics or military weaponscitation neededthe extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from  to  of revenuescitation needed that is gross profits will be as much as  of the sales cost with manufacturing costing only  of the product price because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product most industrial companies get  revenues onlycitation needed on a technical level high tech organizations explore ways to repurpose and repackage advanced technologies as a way of amortizing the high overheadcitation needed they often reuse advanced manufacturing processes expensive safety certifications specialized embedded software computeraided design software electronic designs and mechanical subsystemscitation needed research from  has shown that firms with a persistent rd strategy outperform those with an irregular or no rd investment program businessedit research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result as a result higher rd spending does not guarantee more creativity higher profit or a greater market sharefull citation needed research is the most risky financing area because both the development of an invention and its successful realization carries uncertainty including the profitability of the invention one way of reducing the uncertainty of researching knowhows is to obtain already researched knowhows benefit by sectoredit in general it has been found that there is a positive correlation between the research and development and firm productivity across all sectors but that this positive correlation is much stronger in hightech firms than in lowtech firms in research done by francesco crespi and cristiano antonelli hightech firms were found to have virtuous matthew effects while lowtech firms experienced vicious matthew effects meaning that hightech firms were awarded subsidies on merit while lowtech firms most often were given subsidies based on name recognition even if not put to good use while the strength of the correlation between rd spending and productivity in lowtech industries is less than in hightech industries studies have been done showing nontrivial carryover effects to other parts of the marketplace by lowtech rd government expendituresedit united statesedit president barack obama requested  billion for research  development in fy a large partquantify of this spending was devoted to basic research on the mechanisms of disease yet governmentfunded research that paid for the work in discovering the human genetic code dna has patentrestrictionscitation needed european unionedit research and innovation in europe are financially supported by the programme horizon  which is open to

manufacturer usually provides an identifier for each particular type of product they make known as a model model variant or model number often abbreviated as mn mn or model no for example dyson ltd a manufacturer of appliances mainly vacuum cleaners requires customers to identify their model in the support section of the website brand and model can be used together to identify products in the market the model number is not necessarily the same as the manufacturer part number mpn because of the huge amount of similar products in the automotive industry there is a special kind of defining a car with options marks attributes that represent the characteristics features of the vehicle a model of a car is defined by some basic options like body engine gear box and axles the variants of a model are built by some additional options like color seats wheels mirrors trims entertainment and assistant systems etc options that exclude each other pairwise build an optionfamily that means that you can choose only one option by each family and you have to choose exactly one option this kind of product definition fulfill the requirements of an ideal boolean algebra and can be helpful to construct a product configurator sometimes a set of options car features are combined to an automotive package and are offered by a lower price a consistent car definition is essential for the production planning and control in the automotive industry to generate a master production schedule which is the fundamental for the enterprise resource planning in addition a specific unit of a product is usually and has to be identified by a serial number which is necessary to distinguish products with the same product definition in the case of automotive products its called the vehicle
