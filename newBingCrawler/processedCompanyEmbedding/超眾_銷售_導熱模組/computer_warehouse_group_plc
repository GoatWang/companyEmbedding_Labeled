warehouse group plc cwg mr james agada has advised entrepreneurs to leverage on opportunities technology innovations afford to boost their productivity and grow their businesses “you have to use technology to push your business and this age of innovations has made technology cheaper today you do not h⋯⋯ave to be in all locations but you can open an online store and be visible in many locations you can stay in one location and be able to track what you have in multiple shops that you own and we have rolled out a couple of such innovations uniquely for smes that you will need to exploit” he advised he gave this insight in a presentation at the nd annual conference of the national association of small and medium scale enterprises nasme held in lagos recently the event which had in attendance over  hundred business owners representatives of government agencies finance institutions and interest groups serves as a platform whereon key players in the industry deliberate on creating sustainable opportunities for msmes to grow in his presentation titled ‘ten lessons we have learnt at cwg plc” mr agada shared ten lessons every entrepreneur should learn  from cwg plc in order to attain entrepreneurial success according to mr agada these lessons are predicated upon a collection of experiences founders of cwg plc had in the journey from being a startup to being a panafrican ict firm “the intervening years between when we were a startup business and now have not been all rosy but each challenge and achievement we have faced and scaled served as lesson that has kept us going strong” he said he pointed out that the need to grow and preserve brand identity is the first lesson entrepreneurs must learn from the cwg experience  “it is how you project your brand that is going to add so much value to your business and you have to spend time and energy in building your brand one of such ways is going the extra mile to deliver on your promises and making sure people know that you are doing the things you do” he said next to branding mr agada said is the need for partnership according to him “we learnt that if the journey is far you will get there with less stress if you are walking with somebody else partnership is important and it isn’t just about people who complement you but companies that will complement you” he also encouraged the business owners to make adherence to processes a priority “having a sustainable process is what is going to allow you bring people off the street and make them become profitable and productive for you if you alone have the knowledge of how things run in your head you will not be able to grow” he said mr agada also stressed the importance of corporate governance to the sustainability of any business he explained “if you have a powerful ceo he can easily drag the company down by taking the wrong decisions because nobody can challenge him so you need someone to challenge you  this starts with simple things for instance the business fund is not your money it is the money of the business you can pay yourself salary but separate the business money from your money” transparency he noted is another key lesson entrepreneurs should imbibe in order to grow “some people say they will not prepare their pl because of government tax but you know what if your secretary friend or accountant helps you prepare fake financial statements so you can dodge tax how would you know the difference if the same friend prepares a fake statement to cheat you you won’t” he said he also highlighted the importance of creative evolution having long term realistic plan corporatizing and placing premium on their customer’s interest to their survival and growth in sum mr agada pointed out that smes need to aim high and strive with their vision to survive “you need to make people realize that you are aiming to be a big company for example if you are aiming to be like proctor and gamble for example you need to think and act like procter and gamble that is what we have come to learn in our  years” he said english ustiếng việtbahasa indonesiaภาษาไทยespañolportuguês brasilfrançais francedeutschitalianomessengerfacebook
