we followed up our highest distribution coverage quarter ever at the end of  with another strong cash flow and distribution coverage quarter  based on actual distributions paid during the quarter we generated a  times coverage ratio im pleased with our performance as adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended march   was  million approximately  ahead of our guidance level as shown on our first quarter earnings slide  looking across our business segments sulfur services was our strongest performer compared to guidance beating our estimate by approximately   fertilizer exceeded expectations on both volume and margin benefiting from favorable market and weather conditions  also marine transportation outperformed versus plan due to improved efficiency and reduced operating costs  our natural gas services segment performed below expectation as a result of warmer weather adversely impacting our wholesale propane business  also we experienced reduced distributions from our west texas lpg pipeline jointventure as a result of lower system throughput in the quarter and the continued rollback of the posted tariff rates by the railroad commission of texas during the ongoing rate proceeding looking at our balance sheet im pleased with the continued trend toward lower leverage  for the first quarter our bank compliant total leverage ratio which includes certain pro forma adjustments and the positive impact of debt reduction from the followon equity offering completed in february was  times  this is the partnerships lowest leverage since the second quarter of  and represents an improvement of approximately  times from our year end  level  this debt reduction coincides with cash flow generation and reduced working capital levels primarily concentrated in our natural gas

publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the united states gulf coast region the partnerships primary business segments include  terminalling storage and packaging services for petroleum products and byproducts  natural gas services including liquids transportation and distribution services and natural gas storage  sulfur and sulfurbased products processing manufacturing marketing and distribution and  marine transportation services for petroleum products and byproducts forwardlooking statements statements about the partnerships outlook and all other statements in this release other than historical facts are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of   these forwardlooking statements and all references to financial estimates rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors many of which are outside the partnerships control which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements  while the partnership believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors  a discussion of these factors including risks and uncertainties is set forth in the partnerships annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  the partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forwardlooking statements including financial estimates whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise use of nongaap financial information the partnerships management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than its financial statements prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap to analyze its performance these include  net income before interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjusted ebitda and  distributable cash flow  the partnerships management views these measures as important performance measures of core profitability for its operations and the ability to generate and distribute cash flow and as key components of its internal financial reporting the partnerships management believes investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda  certain items excluded from ebitda and adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing an entitys financial performance such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets the partnership has included information concerning ebitda and adjusted ebitda because it provides investors and management with additional information to better understand the following financial performance of the partnerships assets without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis the partnerships operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other similarly situated entities and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects  the partnerships method of computing adjusted ebitda may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities the economic substance behind the partnerships use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of the partnerships assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs support its indebtedness and make distributions to its unitholders distributable cash flow  distributable cash flow is a significant performance measure used by the partnerships management and by external users of its financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to compare basic cash flows generated by the partnership to the cash distributions it expects to pay unitholders  distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for the partnerships unitholders since it serves as an indicator of the partnerships success in providing a cash return on investment specifically this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not the partnership is generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in its quarterly distribution rates  distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publiclytraded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the units yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder ebitda adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to or more meaningful than net income cash flows from operating activities or any other measure presented in accordance with gaap the partnerships method of computing these measures may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities additional information concerning the partnership is available on the partnerships website at wwwmartinmidstreamcom or by contacting
