compared to the same quarter in  net income attributable to genesis energy lp of  million or  per unit for the second quarter of  compared to  million or  per unit for the same period in  representing an increase of  million or  cash flows from operating activities of  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million for the same period in  representing an increase of  million or  available cash before reserves of  million in the second quarter of  a decrease of  million over the prior year quarter or  providing  coverage for our quarterly distribution to unitholders attributable to that quarter which is discussed below adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of  was  million a decrease of  million or  over the prior year quarter our adjusted debt to pro forma ebitda ratio is  as of june   these amounts are calculated and further discussed later in this press release on august   we will pay a total quarterly distribution of  million based on our quarterly declared distribution of  per unit attributable to our financial and operational results for the second quarter of  this represents an increase in our distribution for the fortyeighth consecutive quarter grant sims ceo of genesis energy said “during the quarter we experienced extraordinary planned and unplanned downtime by our producer customers at several major fields in the gulf of mexico which resulted in our reported segment margin for the quarter being negatively impacted by some  million while we expect some continuation of such negative effects in the third quarter we believe they will be largely behind us going into the fourth quarter and in no way are reflective of the underlying longterm resiliency of the deepwaterin spite of these specific challenges we are encouraged by the ramping volumes we are beginning to experience on our recently completed organic projects in the baton rouge corridor and in and around texas city our marine and refinery services segments performed consistent with our expectations all in all we feel we are reasonably positioned at this point to realize increasing financial contributions from our businesses with little additional capital required this should allow us to work towards our goal of decreasing leverage in future periods with the majority of our capital spend behind us and the majority of our expected increased segment margin in front of uson august   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with a subsidiary of tronox limited tronox pursuant to which we will acquire for approximately  billion in cash all of tronoxs trona and tronabased exploring mining processing producing marketing and selling business the “alkali business” the alkali business is the world’s largest producer of natural soda ash also known as sodium carbonate naco a basic building block for a number of ubiquitous products including flat glass container glass dry detergent and a variety of chemicals and other industrial products the alkali business produces approximately four million tons of natural soda ash per year representing approximately  of all the natural soda ash produced in the world and based on current production rates has an estimated reserve life remaining of over  years having been in continuous operations for almost  years it sells its products to a broad industrydiverse and worldwide customer base including numerous longterm relationshipsin conjunction with the transaction genesis has received binding commitments for the purchase of approximately  million of  class a convertible preferred units from investment vehicles affiliated with kkr global infrastructure investors ii lp “kkr” and gso capital partners lp “gso” kkr and gso will acquire approximately  million units at a price of  per unitthe acquisition of tronox’s alkali business is an exciting growth opportunity for us we believe the acquisition to be immediately deleveraging and will provide further diversification and substantial scale to the partnership the business is a great strategic fit with our current asset base and shares many characteristics with our existing refinery services business it is a market leader with high barriers to entry and generates stable and predictable cash flow with production sold out each of the last seven years and estimated last twelve months adjusted ebitda of  million we are excited to partner with kkr and gso two leading global investment firms we believe their investment not only validates our view of the alkali business opportunity but also underscores the quality of genesis’ existing diverse asset footprint including industry leading positions in multiple businesseswe currently expect to fund the acquisition price and related transaction costs with proceeds from the sale of the preferred units a notes offering andor borrowings under our  billion senior secured credit facility as well as cash on hand we expect to close the acquisition in the second half of financial resultssegment marginbeginning in the fourth quarter of  we started reporting our results on a comparative basis in four business segments due to the increasingly integrated nature of our onshore operations the results of our onshore pipeline transportation segment formerly reported under its own segment is now reported in our onshore facilities and transportation segment the onshore facilities and transportation segment was formerly named as our supply and logistics segment this segment has been renamed in the second quarter of  to more accurately describe the nature of its operationsread morevariances between the second quarter of  the “ quarter” and the second quarter of  the “ quarter” in these components are explained belowsegment results for the  quarter and  quarter were as follows   three months endedjune      in thousands offshore pipeline transportation     onshore facilities and transportation   refinery services   marine transportation     total segment margin       offshore pipeline transportation segment margin for the  quarter decreased  million or  from the  quarter the  quarter was negatively impacted by both anticipated and unanticipated downtime at several major fields including weatherrelated downtime affecting certain of our deepwater gulf of mexico customers and thus certain of our key crude oil and natural gas assets including our poseidon pipeline and certain associated laterals which we own while such downtime was temporary and each of the major fields are back to being fully operational we expect additional planned downtime for maintenance involving certain customers fields during the third quarter of onshore facilities and transportation segment margin increased by  million or  between the two quarters in the  quarter this increase is primarily attributable to the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the baton rouge corridor in addition relative to the first quarter of  we experienced an increase in sequential volumes on our texas pipeline system as the repurposing of our houston area crude oil pipeline and expansion of our terminal infrastructure became operational in the  quarter these factors were partially offset by a decrease in our segment margin due to lower demand in our historical backtoback or buysell crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers leases to local or regional resale pointsrefinery services segment margin for the  quarter decreased  million or  the  quarter results were in line with our expectations and include the effects of previously disclosed commercial discussions with certain of our host refineries and several nahs customers which resulted in extending the term and tenor of a large number of contractual relationships this includes the extension of our largest refinery services agreement at our westlake facility through marine transportation segment margin for the  quarter decreased  million or  from the  quarter the decrease in segment margin is primarily due to a combination of slightly lower utilization and lower day rates on our inland fleet as well as lower day rates on our offshore fleet which offset higher utilization as adjusted for planned dry docking time this excludes the mt american phoenix which is under long term contract through september  in our inland fleet utilization was strong at the beginning of the  quarter but slowed towards the end as turnarounds at certain of our refinery customers ended and other market factors resulted in weaker demand for black oil barge freightother components of net incomein the  quarter we recorded net income attributable to genesis energy lp of  million compared to  million in the  quarter this increase principally relates to a  million gain involving the sale and disposition of certain noncore natural gas gathering and platform assets in the gulf of mexico this increase was partially offset by a noncash provision of  million relating to certain leased railcars no longer in usewe have increased our quarterly

accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap our nongaap financial measures should not be considered i as alternatives to gaap measures of liquidity or financial performance or ii as being singularly important in any particular context they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information our available cash before reserves adjusted ebitda and total segment margin measures are just three of the relevant data points considered from time to timewhen evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions including making discretionary payments such as quarterly distributions our board of directors and management team has access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information such as our financial statements operational information various nongaap measures internal forecasts credit metrics analyst opinions performance liquidity and similar measures income cash flow and expectations for us and certain information regarding some of our peers additionally our board of directors and management team analyze and place different weight on various factors from time to time we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management lenders analysts and other market participants we attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach herhis own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external useravailable cash before reservespurposes uses and definitionavailable cash before reserves also referred to as distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and rating agencies to aid in assessing among other things    the financial performance of our assets  our operating performance  the viability of potential projects including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain nondiscretionary cash requirements including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements and  our ability to make certain discretionary payments such as distributions on our units growth capital expenditures certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness we define available cash before reserves as net income as adjusted for certain items some of the most significant of which tend to be a the elimination of certain noncash revenues expenses gains losses or charges such as depreciation and amortization unrealized gain or loss on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes gain or loss on sale of nonsurplus assets and equity compensation expense that is not settled in cash b the substitution of distributable cash generated by our equity investees in lieu of our equity income attributable to our equity investees includes distributions attributable to the quarter and received during or promptly following such quarter c the elimination of expenses related to acquiring or constructing assets that provide new sources of cash flows d certain litigation expenses that are not deducted in determining our pro forma adjusted ebitda under our senior secured credit facility and e the subtraction of maintenance capital utilized which is described in detail belowdisclosure format relating to maintenance capitalwe use a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because our maintenance capital expenditures vary materially in nature discretionary vs nondiscretionary timing and amount from time to time we believe that without such modified disclosure such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our available cash before reserves measure our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure which we deduct to arrive at available cash before reserves our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for nondiscretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures operating expenses and depreciation from period to periodmaintenance capital requirementsmaintenance capital expendituresmaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or nondiscretionary depending on the facts and circumstancesinitially substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures were a related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure b nondiscretionary in nature and c immaterial in amount as compared to our available cash before reserves measure those historical expenditures were nondiscretionary or mandatory in nature because we had very little if any discretion as to whether or when we incurred them we had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices if we had not made those expenditures we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines which would not have been economically feasible an example of a nondiscretionary or mandatory maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely legally andor economically in the absence of such replacementas we exist today a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be a related to our assets other than pipelines such as our marine vessels trucks and similar assets b discretionary in nature and c potentially material in amount as compared to our available cash before reserves measure those expenditures will be discretionary or nonmandatory in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them we will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner if we chose not make those expenditures we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures we would incur increased operating expenses including maintenance expenses an example of a discretionary or nonmandatory maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expensesin summary as we continue to expand certain nonpipeline portions of our business we are experiencing changes in the nature discretionary vs nondiscretionary timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically management’s recently increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and nondiscretionary expenditures we believe it would be inappropriate to derive our available cash before reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures such as growth capital expenditures distributionsdividends and equity buybacks unfortunately not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or nondiscretionary in nature therefore we developed a measure maintenance capital utilized that we believe is more useful in the determination of available cash before reserves our maintenance capital utilized measure which is described in more detail below constitutes a proxy for nondiscretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures operating expenses and depreciation from period to periodmaintenance capital utilizedwe believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our available cash before reserves measure we define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each projectcomponent in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projectscomponentsbecause we did not initially use our maintenance capital utilized measure our future maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since december  adjusted ebitdapurposes uses and definitionadjusted ebitda is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external
