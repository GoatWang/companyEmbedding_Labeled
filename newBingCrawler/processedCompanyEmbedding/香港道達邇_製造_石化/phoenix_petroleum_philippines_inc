to the  and  increase in sales volume of petroleum products and lubricants respectively however there is a slight decline of  on its service revenue the rise of the prices of petroleum products on  caused a slight rise of revenues on that year it is much better if prices will lower down as high prices can greatly affect the company’s revenues and profit as wellthe companys cost and expenses are increasing which is not good for the company as much as possible companies tend to lower their cost so that they will gain a higher profit but compared to the revenues the cost and expenses are very near and even higher than the revenues which resulted to low and negative income this tells that the company is incurring more cost and expenses than a positive income thus this resulted to a negative impact to the company and lower profitability ratios particularly the profit marginnet profit of the company fluctuated from a very high profit to a negative profit and then a slight increase this is due to high cost and expenses and lesser revenue even though the company has a great value on year  the preceding years show a slow increase which is very alarming it is not good at all if this continues the company will lose and they may not be able to declare and distribute dividends investors might be discouraged and the company might not be able to support and sustain its business phoenix petroleum will have to innovate their products and services that have a lower cost yet a better quality to make something new in the industry this will lead to higher operating margin and profit margin as well example of this is to emphasize the importance of safety and delivery of products another example is to replace or partially use other source of oil and gas like excreting oil from plants or other cheaper yet better sourcesrecommendationthe group recommends the second alternative course of action since the company is profitable enough the company has the capacity to spend a significant amount of money for research and development that can help in innovating new products and services that has lower costs through this the company may attract customers and these new products and services that have lower costs may help the company recover from previous low profitability ratios and improve their sales and reduce cost of sales and other additional expensesconclusionthe group finally concludes that the company has to improve their sales to have a higher income and make new strategies to lower its costs and expenses thus lead to higher profitability ratios and return to its investors and owners solutionsfinused phoenixs  financial statementsfull transcriptmore presentations by tweenah cee copy of phoenix petroleum philippines
