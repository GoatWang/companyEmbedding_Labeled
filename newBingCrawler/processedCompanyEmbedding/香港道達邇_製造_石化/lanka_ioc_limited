while another  depots are operated by cpstl our depot being situated in trincomalee it takes considerable time for supplies to reach different parts of the country however employees of lanka ioc plc

make the general public comfortable our supplies have increased to almost double from our trincomalee depot on  july and similar efforts are on today also lanka ioc is committed towards the cause of
