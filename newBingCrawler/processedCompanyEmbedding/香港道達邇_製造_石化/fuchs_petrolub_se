conference call joining today’s call presentation all participants will be in a listenonly mode the presentation will be followup questionandanswer session operator instructions i would now like to turn the conference over to thomas altmann please go ahead thomas altmann thank you good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to our q  earnings conference call my name is thomas altmann head of investor relations with fuchs petrolub with me today dagmar steinert cfo of fuchs let me hand over directly to dagmar for a short presentation which is as usual followed by the qa session dagmar steinert the floor is yours dagmar steinert thank you thomas good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank from our side thank you for joining us as well we had a good start to the year  and finished our first quarter with the growth and sales and earnings compared to the previous year quarter the increase sales by  to € million and we had organic growth in our regions we had slight external growth due to our positions in the year  in north america and we had tailwind from currency our ebit increase by  to € million and our outlook for the fullyear  remains unchanged let me turn to slide  to give you a better overview what happened on a quarterly basis the compare a strong first quarter  with recent quarter  in the year  for second quarter was quite strong therefore in our views it is better to compare the first half of the year  with first half of the year  coming now to the next slide number  there we can see how our sales developed we see an organic growth of  € million and that organic growth is across on region i come later in detail to the region our acquisitions in north america contributed  to our growth in sales and from the currency we had  growth as a tailwind overall as i said at before  growth in sales but i would like to give you some more details about the development of sales in our regions i would like to start with europe where we see an organic growth of  and just slightly negative currency effect of  in europe we had to good sales growth in germany and in the uk but i would like to remind you that in the first quarter  the development in europe was quite weak in asia pacific africa to see an organic growth of  this strong growth was mainly in china but also in australia and south africa due to currency we gain another  as well that is for strong south african went and the australian dollar in america due to the economic recovery in north america and brazil we see an organic growth of remarkable at  there we have as well  or  external growth due to our chevron and ultrachem acquisition the year before overall  organic growth in the whole group if you turn now to the income statement of the first quarter  we see this remarkable earnings and sales increases and as i said before the first quarter  is quite strong we picked up the good development of the last quarter of  and we compared with the weaker quarter  and of course as influenced by the easter holidays because in  the easter holidays has been in the first quarter in  we have easter in the second quarter so i just would like to repeat that in our – as its better to compare the first half of  which we will published in august with the first half of the year  if i turn your attention to our gross profit you can see that our gross profit went up by  and thats less than our sales increased that’s due to mix and price effect theres a change in the product mix and we have some price effect as well but our other function costs increases also unproportional and therefore we are able to show an increase in the ebit before equity of  and after our equity income our ebit is up  it’s € million of € million in the year before our earnings after tax are even more up  thats due to our tax rate where we had a gain of one percentage point if you have a look at our ebit development by the quarters you can see that its somehow changed we are now comparing somehow appleswithapples because in  we had all the times influenced by the big acquisitions pentosin and statoil and they are – now we are comparing some of the same numbers and you can see that we have the last three quarters ebit of € million and just the first quarter  and the second quarter  are somehow different im sure youre going to ask one question why our ebitda for first quarter  is on the same level as last quarter  while on the sales side we see an increase in sales if i compare these two quarters just to give you an answer on that now that is the main impact is in the fourth quarter  the year end booking and the position other income and expenses we had in the fourth quarter  some positive effect of plan amendments in the pension plans in uk there was a positive effect we had some release acquisition and we had some currency gains so that has got nothing really to do with the operating business if i come now to our next slide to the ebit by regions you can see that of course europe still remains the biggest portion of our group earnings and there is got an increase of ebit by € million or  which goes along with the sales increase and for the ebit the same belongs as belong to the sales there is a significant roles in germany if you come now to asiapacific africa we have an increase in ebit of € million from € million to € million that’s more than  but sales went up higher therefore the margin  the ebit margin before equity in asiapacific africa is below the previous years quarter and we had additional oem business in asiapacific africa with slightly lower margins and that’s one of the reasons in america we saw an ebit of € million thats € million more than the previous year’s quarter and thats an increase of  but the ebit margin before equity came down in america minus  percentage points in america we have seen positive earnings trend in the us and we have seen brazil picking up slightly anyhow the margins came down we had gains in the mining business on the sales side but with some lower margins and in america we had some nonrecurring items but overall with an increase in sales of  and the margins will go up again coming now to the cash flow of the first quarter  the free cash flow is € million above the previous year and that’s  and i think it’s remarkably good number wherever it comes from of course from our higher earnings earnings after tax increased by € million but as well we have been able to decrease the number of the capital which we need for our working capital so here the amount of money came down from € million to € million on the capex side you will see the same number as in the year before € million and you know that we are having our € million investment of capex program and we will see in  more or less the same number weve seen in  so overall an improvement in free cash flow our employees came up in the first quarter by  people that was mainly in europe and mainly in marketing and sales and production i would now like to come to our unchanged outlook because today we are confirming our outlook and based on the good start to the year you might think that our outlook may seem some more cautious but we see some risks with regard to the macro economic developments with the political environment and you all know the topic if it’s the brexit and the question how stable is the – if it’s the election in france or the question what will happen in the us and there are lots of things therefore we confirm our fullyear outlook at this time and still see sales growth between  to  but thats mainly organic without the currency effect and slightly lower ebit increase  to  and yes it’s so much from my side and now we are happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of martin rödiger of kepler cheuvreux please go ahead martin rödiger thank you and good afternoon and thank you for taking my three questions first on the ebit margin development can you quantify the nonrecurring items in asia the mix effects in australia and in americas and the higher input costs in the first quarter and secondly you mentioned at the last analyst meeting that you expect also a margin dilution from the higher depreciation charges as well as higher staff costs is that still – has that also played a role in q or was the effect just negligible because the staff numbers increased by only  and the depreciation charges increased by just  million and finally on the regional development i saw that also the organic growth obviously in australia south africa and brazil seems to have improved quite substantially and in the past you were not really happy with these three regions so australia south africa and brazil can you help me to understand what is changed regarding these three regions in recent time that you are now more optimistic on these regions thanks dagmar steinert yes thank you for your questions mr rödiger to start with your first question about the ebit margin development and nonrecurring items just to make it clear we only have nonrecurring items in the segment america and we dont want or we don’t name the number is of course very low singledigit million number it’s nothing really which is important for the group but in the first quarter the numbers are smaller and therefore even  million would make a big difference in terms of percentage of increase and therefore yes i thing thats all im able to say to that our higher depreciation you’ll see in the first quarter  an increase of € million and of course there are all things which reduce a bit the margin thats right but were not going to address these figures and weve got of course higher personnel expenses personnel cost but the things we face and that are our higher – our cost base gets higher and therefore we said that in march already we see our ebit increase a bit less than our sales increase and there nothing really changed the organic growth you mentioned in australia brazil and south africa in australia we picked up we had some really good improvement in the mining business in brazil its more or less the question of an overall economy development and in south africa our activities are picking up after theyve been for some while more or less flat martin rödiger maybe i have – a lot will asked in followup question on the raw materials have you been fully able to pass on all raw material increase to your customer in the first quarter and or do you want to convey that the mix effect in the first quarter was more important than the raw material effect dagmar steinert in the first quarter in general we haven’t seen significant raw material effect or increase in raw material cost we will see that in the upcoming month in the second quarter and because it always need sometime after it comes to our books so in the first quarter there is no effect out of increasing raw materials in there on a significant effect and therefore the decrease in the gross margin is due to mix effect product mix effect and when we set price effect that means that we have the one of the other order or of course it comes from the product mix with lower margin martin rödiger thank you very much operator the next question comes from the line of daniel buchta of main first bank please go ahead daniel buchta yes good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for taking my questions i also have three ones in the press release you got it to have seen some easter benefits i assume its especially in europe but also partly in america and can you quantify this or is it just more in one percentage point range is it more two percentage points and what does this mean for q is it fair to assume especially for europe to see a slowdown thats the first question the second one in can you just elaborate a bit that current trends youre seeing in q so far is there already a slowdown or do you see a continuation of the very favorable trends you saw in q and the last one on the guidance i mean you touched it already a bit i mean on the back of the strong q especially on the topline performance do you – it’s kind of would imply the slowdown especially in the second half probably is it more higher comps that youre seeing there or is it really just that you see the underlying trends might become less favorable that’s it from my side thank you very much dagmar steinert okay mr buchta thank you the easter benefit we are not – first of all not able to quantify and we dont want to quantify it its just to point out that we have a base effect and that we compare a weak quarter q  with a strong quarter q  and of course an easter effect is mainly europe maybe a bit in other countries as well but its just evidence the current trend in april we dont see really a slowdown at the moment but its just more feeling because we havent got any numbers yet for april the month hasnt even finished and in our guidance its just the – all these questions of risks and challenging environment that we dont see there today any room to increase our guidance and of course its a base effect here as well and as i pointed out in the sort presentation due to the quarterly development i think its very important to compare the first six months of  with the previous year and you as well of course will have a better view about the development compared to the previous year daniel buchta great thank you very much operator next question comes from the line of michael schäfer of commerzbank please go head michael schäfer yes thanks for taking my two questions if i may first one is on apac i try to get a better understand and what happens there in the first quarter showing such a strong organic growth repeating basically what you have shown into the fourth quarter already while on the other hand do you have seen a significant dilution on the ebit margin side in contrast to what you have reported the year before and but also the quarter before on the fourth quarter so you mentioned end contracts are probably adversely affecting the mix effect there but this was probably also the case already in the in the fourth quarter so id like to get a better view what happens there and also related to apac shall we assume basically given that youve probably picked up a major order maybe in the fourth quarter first quarter that this is strong organic growth is at least continuing in the second and the third quarter until comps are getting tougher and this kind of dilution on the ebit margin side is going to continue in the course of the year this would be let’s say my first question and the second one is on your networking capital significantly improved in the first quarter  despite a strong increase in sales so how is this evolving basically in the course of  should we assume a normalization year on a networking capital drain thank you dagmar steiner thank you mr schäfer your first question regarding the asiapacific we had a very strong organic growth in the fourth quarter  and in the first quarter  in china in the oem business and in the fourth quarter we’ve been somehow surprised as well about that really strong growth we didnt expect that and it hasnt just been like yearend buying due do some tax benefits which has been cut by the chinese government and the organic growth just continued in the first quarter  for the upcoming month we see if you look at our overall outlook of course somehow it slowdown because we stick to our outlook and therefore we cant expect an organic growth for the whole group to continue to be  each quarter your question regarding the dilution of the ebit before equity margin in asiapacific where we’ve seen reduction of  thats the mix effect of course and well its a question of small numbers of course as well because i mean the first quarter three months very small numbers and im not always sure of the every single costs cutoff really exactly and we compare here – that’s basic that you compare a very strong quarter with slightly weaker quarter in the year before and just to point it out asiapacific africa has a great development even in ebit its an increase of over  our improvement in net operating working capital is compared with the first quarter  really good but in  you might remember we have this implementation of sap in the whole production of our lubritech activities and therefore we had some delays in delivering product and every thing and obviously in the first quarter  might not be representative for the normal net operating working capital and on the other hand of course our net operating working capital in total or as a percentage of sales is came up  a bit but one reason is these increasing intercompany deliveries out of the pentosin business which we acquired in  michael schäfer okay just sort of followup you on the apac margins youre saying basically that your organic growth is probably declining in the next couple of quarters i don’t really understand why but lets take it this way does this mean basically the sales mix will enrich again and hence this will be the driver for margins moving up during the upcoming quarter so how should we think about this one dagmar steinert well as you know you visibility for our sales our order is very short because we dont have any order backlog and we dont have the longterm contracts therefore its more expectations and its difficult to presume and lets wait and see michael schäfer okay thank you operator next question comes from the line of markus mayer of baader please go ahead markus mayer hi hello everybody so addon question firstly on net from capital to sales ratio how do you seethe development given the expected raw material cost increases in  and then secondly again on this nonrecurring item in north america am i right that was a negative oneoff and just as a indiscernible cash on this mix effect in asia and portfolio oneoff or is this – just started to therefore that sustainable and maybe as indiscernible they have the lower margins on this business and that’s basically my question dagmar steinert okay just to start with these oneoff items in america yes that was – is a negative effect markus mayer okay dagmar steinert and our margins in asia pacific africa where we are in the first quarter  below previous year i believe that we wont see for the fullyear in terms of margin the number weve seen before so minus  markus mayer basically this negative effect just been leveling out whether or should be shrink on that dagmar steinert somehow yes markus mayer okay dagmar steinert and you had a question about net operating working capital and sales ratio but i didn’t get it right markus mayer yes the question is basically if the current net from capital to sales ratio is good run rate going forward in particular given your expectation that raw material cost will start to rise for you in the second quarter dagmar steinert okay well the raw material price increase which we expect today or which we see will be in general overall  to  even if some raw materials or the increase is higher with other players so it’s a mix effect as well of course but  to  maybe  it’s difficult to predict but something around that number we would definitely see markus mayer that’s net from capital ratio of  is a run rate for the fullyear dagmar steinert yes markus mayer okay perfect thank you operator next question comes from the line of knud hinkel of equinet ag please go ahead knud hinkel hi good afternoon everybody thank you for taking the question if i may first one would be whether you have seen any contribution from your newbuild equity factories in q already second question on the tax rate you said you saw an improvement by one percentage point question is whether that is going to be sustainable in the course of the year and last question is a followup to the raw material how long do you think it will take to pass through the increased raw material at the second quarter is that the usual six months or do you think that might take longer thank you dagmar steinert thank you mr hinkel well your first question the contribution of our new grease factory in chicago actually none at all because we are still in the pace of ramping up their production and weve got an officinal opening in may but we wont see a bigger contributions before  because it will take some time to ramp up to build up the whole production with all this different product in terms of tax rate we expect for the fullyear tax rate of around  and the improvement weve seen in the first quarter is just due to the indiscernible in connection with dividends because we always collect dividends from our local subsidiaries to payout our dividend to our shareholders in may the raw material cost it’s still unchanged that means that we always need one to two quarter so three to six months at least to passthrough raw material prices increases so there are nothing changed in the setup or in the way we treat that and thats one of the reasons why in our outlook the ebit increase is below sales increase because we just got there this timeline knud hinkel okay thank you operator next question comes from the line of andrew heap of berenberg please go ahead andrew heap hi dagmar thanks for taking my questions firstly could you elaborates a bit more on the end market development and so – in different regions where you see different industries picking up and i know you said mine was improving but also touch on the automotive market and also would you be able to comment if you think there was any prebuying from customers in anticipation of any of this inflation and then finally on the capex do you still feel confident of reaching around  million by the end of the year given that your quite far below a quarters up thanks dagmar steinert okay yes andrew thank you for your questions to start with your last one our capex that’s always the same in the first quarter our capex spending is quite low you’ve seen it in  as well where we reached  million for the whole year and you’ve the same number in the first quarter so thats just normal the same happens every year and our capex spending – well if you split the capex spending for a whole year it is due to the billing and everything mainly in the second half of the year andrew heap okay dagmar steinert regarding prebuying from customers we dont see – we are not aware that a prebuying is taking place and the different end markets which are in our different regions overall there is nothing much to say in europe if got over all industries a good growth in north america in australia we got a good increase in the mining industry in china but in north america as well we had good development in the automotive business but automotive business here doesn’t only mean passenger cars is of course trucks heavy vehicles and these things as well but we havent seen any really bad development of any industry in one of these regions andrew heap okay great thanks dagmar steinert you are welcome operator the next question comes from the line of oliver schwarz of warburg research please go ahead oliver schwarz yes thank you for taking my question im still trying to get my head around the strong growth in asia you just pointed out following the question that growth in china was – in asia was predominantly driven by the automotive industry while in australia that the mining industry is still alive and kicking and came back to let’s say more strengths than before however searching from the numbers of car producers in asia it seems like your growth is ahead of markets so are you in the position to claim that you have gained market share is that existing customers that have just ordered more or did you win new customer or consumer groups that could explain the significant increase in sales that started already in q last year and that brings us back i think to the question of sustainability because dagmar you said that its unlikely to be sustainable this kind of growth until the end of this year because basically it is unlikely that those growth rates are sustainable but i havent yet gotten an impression that you have given a reason for that could you help me out with that please dagmar steinert yes oliver well due to our short visibility and all these uncertainty in the overall environment we just dont see anything to adjust our outlook for the fullyear because just one good quarter and when we made our outlook we expected already a strong first quarter in  that was not really a big surprise we dont see any reason to increase our outlook and especially china yes we’ve got really good growth and higher organic growth in the overall industry or the market it is with existing customers and it’s a mix – that’s a question of mixed effect we had some new customers but nothing really were to mention well a strong increase in the oem business and partly due to our pentosin business oliver schwarz right i might throw in a last question have you seen that way of so to speak breaking already are at least coming in the second quarter have you seen any indications of a slowdown yet dagmar steinert as april hasn’t ended by now and we get the first number of course some days later but i’m in contact with my colleagues and we havent seen a big slowdown yet oliver schwarz okay fair enough thank you very much dagmar steinert you are welcome end of qa operator there are no further questions at this time i’ll hand back to dagmar steinert for closing comment thomas altmann since theres no further question this was it from our side thank you very much for your interest in listening we wish you a very good weekend and see you next time dagmar steinert thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen the
