and was based in princeton new jersey prior to the spinoff dnp had established a joint venture with francebased agroindustrie recherches et développements ard to develop and commercialize biobased succinic acid in  dnp green technology acquired  percent of the joint venture from ard and changed its corporate name to bioamber after the company was spun off from dnp it was privately financed in  by a group of institutional investors led by sofinnova partners mitsui  co samsung ventures and the cliffton group in  and  naxos capital partners and lanxess became investors in the company which raised a total of  million over three rounds of financing between  and  in may  bioamber completed its initial public offering on the new york stock exchange under the symbol bioa raising  million in gross proceeds and issuing warrants for an additional  million in common stock technologyedit bioamber produces biobased succinic acid by fermenting sugars the company uses a proprietary yeast that it has exclusively licensed from cargill cargill originally identified a yeast strain that has the ability to ferment at a low ph cargill modified that strain for the production of lactic acid and has been using that new yeast strain at commercial scale since  bioamber collaborated with cargill to develop from the original strain a new one that could ferment at a low ph and tolerate high concentrations of succinic acid giving it a distinct advantage over other microorganisms producing succinic acid via fermentation bioamber has designed its commercial plant in sarnia for the production of biobased succinic acid to operate with its yeast technology bioamber has licensed from johnson matthey davy technologies a catalyst technology that converts biobased succinic acid into biobased butanediol bdo the technology involves the vapor phase hydrogenation of succinic acid ester into bdo and tetrahydrofuran thf jm davy is reportedly the global leader in bdo and thf technology with  licenses deployed representing approximately  tons per year of installed bdo and thf capacity or  of worldwide capacity their technology currently produces bdothf from maleic anhydride a petrochemical the first step in that route converts ma to succinic acid thus succinic is an alternative feedstock jm davy has adjusted its process and tested bioambers biosuccinic acid so it can substitute maleic anhydride without impacting performance process economics or product quality sustainabilityedit the use of fermentation to produce building block chemicals offers the prospect of an improved carbon footprint and lower energy intensity than the petrochemical route to the same chemicals manufacturingedit bioamber produced biobased succinic acid from january  to december  at a large demonstration plant owned and operated by the company’s former joint venture partner ard the demonstration plant operated at the  liter fermenter scale which at the time was one of the largest scale fermentations among startup companies in the field of biobased chemicals bioamber claim to have gained extensive experience from operating this plant for five years and incorporated the learning and improvements into the design of its commercial plant in sarnia canada bioamber established a joint venture with mitsui  co to build and operate a biosuccinic acid plant in sarnia ontario with a manufacturing capacity of  metric tons  lb per year with bioamber owning  of the venture the facility began construction in august  and began commercial operations in november  the cost of construction was us million and it created  fulltime jobs it is the world’s largest biobased succinic acid plant bioambers integrated management systems in sarnia were iso  registered iso  registered bs ohsas  registered and fssc  registered within four months of operational startup marketsedit succinic acid is a platform chemical that can be used in a broad range of markets from high value niche applications such as personal care products and food additives to large volume applications such as bioplastics pigments plasticizers polyurethanes resins and coatings in  the united states department of energy usdoe published a report on “top valueadded chemicals from biomass” identifying the top opportunities for the production of chemicals from biomass the study prioritized twelve chemicals from a group of over  possible building blocks that could be most effectively manufactured from sugars biosuccinic acid was recognized as one of the renewable building block chemicals with the greatest technical feasibility and commercial potential historically the high cost of producing succinic acid from petroleum feedstock limited its use to a narrow range of applications such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients as a result based on  estimates the market for petroleumbased succinic acid was approximately  metric tons per year representing a market size of approximately  million however market research firms and consultants predict that manufacturing biosuccinic acid will make succinic acid economically feasible for use in greater volumes across a spectrum of new applications a study published in september  by transparency market research projects that the global market for succinic acid will grow at a cagr of  between  and  a study published in august  by roland berger strategy consultants projects that the succinic acid market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between  and  through  when the global market size is expected to be between  and  metric tons the major uses of  bdo are in the production of thf and polybutylene terephthalate or pbt thf is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers resins solvents and printing inks for

butanediol bdo and tetrahydrofuran thf in a single catalytic step bdo and thf are used to make engineering plastics polyurethanes biodegradable polyesters spandex and other specialty chemicals we make exactly the same chemical it is a straight drop in for existing bdo and thf consumers but is biobased rather than being petroleum based providing the products made with our bdo and thf a better

an important ingredient of complex seasoning agents that can be used as an alternative for flavor enhancement and salt replacement for its production bioambers natural flavor grade biobased succinic acid is neutralized and spray dried to a tight particle size distribution this natural ingredient can be used with other flavors and enhancers to either intensify flavor or soften stimulating strong tastes it has good water solubility and high penetration and as a result these effects are accelerated bioamber’s biobased disodium succinate is an anhydrous powder with low particle size making it ideal for blending in dry seasonings read more about biobaseddisodiumsuccinate back to top sustainability life cycle analysis a carbon neutral footprint bioamber is committed to producing chemicals in a more environmentally responsible manner by using renewable feedstock eliminating green house gas emissions and substantially reducing energy consumption we are practicing greener chemistry that is sustainable when our sarnia plant begins production in  it will have an impressive carbon footprint relative to the existing method of producing succinic acid from petroleum our biobased process for making succinic acid will result in a  reduction in green house gas emissions and a  reduction in energy consumption an independent life cycle analysis which evaluated the entire production chain from the planting and harvesting of corn through to the purification of succinic acid revealed that net green house gas emissions for our entire process is zero this represents a  reduction relative to the  tons of greenhouse gases that are emitted per ton of succinic acid produced using the petroleum process at full capacity  tons of succinic acid per year our sarnia facility will reduce green house gas emissions by over  tons per year relative to the petroleum process this is the equivalent of taking  cars off the road each year the life cycle analysis also revealed that our entire process corn to succinic uses  less energy than the petroleumderived process a savings of over  trillion btus per year that is the equivalent to the energy consumed by  us homes annually read more about sustainability life cycle analysis back to top sustainability feedstock development feedstock flexibility bioamber is focused on using the most abundant low cost sugar available but we are also conscious of the need to be as sustainable as possible today north american corn offers the most competitively priced sugar making our succinic acid even more cost competitive we can also use sugar from cane beets sorghum wheat and tapioca to produce succinic acid our longerterm goal is to move to agricultural forestry and eventually industrial waste as alternatives to traditional sugars while these second and third generation sugars are not commercially available today bioamber is working to ensure it has the flexibility to move to these alternative feedstocks when they become economical and available in commercial quantities our proprietary yeast developed with cargill has the ability to efficiently consume xylose the principal sugar that is obtained from hemicellulose a major component of agricultural and forestry waste we are actively screening sugars produced by various new technologies in an effort to determine those that will offer legitimate alternatives to first generation sugars we are also engaged in a research program with canada’s national research counsel that is developing a new organism that can consume methane or methanol instead of sugar and produce succinic acid methane and methanol are expected to be widely available and inexpensive byproducts of the shale gas boom read more about feedstock flexibility back to top download safety data
