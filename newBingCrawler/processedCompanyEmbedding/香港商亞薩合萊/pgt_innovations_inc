in  we believe this acquisition has us well positioned as the highend market returns”   “the underlying drivers of florida’s population expansion rational pricing and consumer confidence is leading to a steady market recovery for both new construction and repair and remodeling activities” hershberger continued “during  florida’s population grew faster than at any time in the last six years which continued to drive florida’s economic growth with the single largest factor being the continued recovery in housing”   hershberger added “slower homeprice appreciation is aiding affordability as home builder confidence continues to soar leading builders to respond to increasing demand for newly constructed homes we expect this to have increasingly broader ripple effects on the supply chain for all

obligation to update these forwardlooking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances after the date of this press release            use of nongaap financial measures   this press release and the financial schedules include financial measures and terms not calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we believe that presentation of nongaap measures such as adjusted net income adjusted net income per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides investors and analysts with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that enables investors and analysts to more thoroughly evaluate our current performance compared to past performance we also believe these nongaap measures provide investors with a better baseline for assessing our future earnings potential the nongaap measures included in this release are provided to give investors access to types of measures that we use in analyzing our results   adjusted net income consists of gaap net income adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation adjusted net income per share consists of gaap net income per share adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation we believe these measures enable investors and analysts to more thoroughly evaluate our current performance as compared to the past performance and provide a better baseline for assessing the companys future earnings potential however these measures do not provide a complete picture of our operations   ebitda consists of gaap net income adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation adjusted ebitda consists of ebitda adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors and analysts about the companys performance because they eliminate the effects of periodtoperiod changes in taxes costs associated with capital investments and interest expense ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not give effect to the cash the company must use to service its debt or pay its income taxes and thus do not reflect the funds generated from operations or actually available for capital investments   our calculations of adjusted net income adjusted net income per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not necessarily comparable to calculations performed by other companies and reported as similarly titled measures these nongaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap measures schedules that reconcile adjusted net income adjusted net income per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda to gaap net income are included in the financial
