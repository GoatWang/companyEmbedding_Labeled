number mpn because of the huge amount of similar products in the automotive industry there is a special kind of defining a car with options marks attributes that represent the characteristics features of the vehicle a model of a car is defined by some basic options like body engine gear box and axles the variants of a model are built by some additional options like color seats wheels mirrors trims entertainment and assistant systems etc options that exclude each other pairwise build an optionfamily that means that you can choose only one option by each family and you have to choose exactly one option this kind of product definition fulfill the requirements of an ideal boolean algebra and can be helpful to construct a product configurator sometimes a set of options car features are combined to an automotive package and are offered by a lower price a consistent car definition is essential for the production planning and control in the automotive industry to generate a master production schedule which is the fundamental for the enterprise resource planning in addition a specific unit of a product is usually and has to be identified by a serial number which is necessary to distinguish

culture education geography history politics hong kong portal v t e manufacturing in hong kong consists of mainly light and labourintensive industries the manufacturing industry started in the th century after the taiping rebellion and continues today although it has largely been replaced by service industries particularly the finance and real estate industries as an entrepôt hong kong had limited manufacturing development until the second world war when the development of manufacturing industries was discontinued due to the japanese occupation the manufacturing industry of the city revived after the second world war the s saw the citys transition from an entrepôt to a manufacturingbased economy the citys manufacturing industry grew rapidly over the next decade the industries were diversified in different aspects in the s one of the most notable reasons of diversification was the oil crisis contents  early development   to    to   industrialisation   to    to   diversification  industrial relocation  formation  impacts  st century  see also  references and footnotes  footnotes  references early developmentedit  to edit after the british acquisition of hong kong island in  the manufacturing industry started to develop most factories were limited to small workshops producing handmade goods primitive methods techniques and facilities were used for production the productivity was low and the manufacturing industry was not as important as the reexportation industry which was the most important at the time at the beginning of the colonial era all factories in the city used to be owned by the british the britishowned factories were mainly limited to shipbuilding and rattan furniture british industrialists did not consider hong kong to be favourable for the manufacturing industry because hong kong lacked natural resources and instead focussed on entrepôt trade and such related industries as shipping and banking guangdong officials fled to hong kong because of the taiping rebellion in the s and s bringing in capital and boosting the manufacturing industry such factories were the first chineseowned ones to appear in hong kong the first printing company appeared in  followed by many different industries such as sweets clothing and soapmaking by the end of the th century the first mechanised factories emerged including a match factory and a pulp company small metal and electronic goods had emerged by the early th century with the development of commerce a few large manufacturing firms appeared although these firms were few in number there was large investment into them and most were leaders in their respective industries after the chinese revolution many chinese firms relocated to hong kong to avoid the constant warfare between warlords during the first world war supplies of daily necessities from europe were cut off industries such as towels cigarettes and biscuits emerged to support the local population resulting in a rise in the light industries  to edit the s and s saw the initial rise of the citys manufacturing industry the textile industry became the backbone of hong kongs manufacturing sector industries such as the firecracker glass and leather industries also emerged and there was a shift from handmade to machinemade products nevertheless hong kongs manufacturing sector was still behind most industrialised cities as the source of capital was rather narrow and was largely limited to guangdong entrepreneurs there are several factors leading to the rise of manufacturing in the s and s including a decline in european industries the tax reduction granted by the ottawa agreement of  and the relocation of factories from mainland china to hong kong for example cheoy lee shipyard the largest hong kongbased shipbuilding company as of  moved from shanghai to hong kong in  because of military conflicts between china and japan hong kongs manufacturing industry faced many challenges during the early s after china regained the right to control its tariffs in  the tax imposed on hong kong goods rose tremendously but the chinese government rejected pleas from hong kong industrialists to lower tariffs the united kingdoms abolishment of the gold standard destabilised exchange rates japans dumping policy also hit hong kong which did not impose tariffs on exports the consumption power of mainland china decreased the great depression further damaged the citys manufacturing sector and led to the liquidation of over  factories however a series of favourable events led to another surge in the manufacturing sector in  including a decline in japanese and italian goods the stabilisation of exchange rates an expansion in mainland markets and the rise of the malay archipelago taikoo dockyard under a us air raid during the second world war by  there were  factories in hong kong with nearly  employees in the manufacturing sector the largest industries at the time were shipbuilding textile manufacturing torches and plastic shoes these goods were sold to mainland china as well as other southeast asian countries near the south china sea among these industries the largest was the shipbuilding industry the shipyards of tai koo hung hom bay and cheoy lee shipyard were the largest each employing over  people the manufacturing industry went into a decline during the japanese occupation like most other industries of the city they faced a neartotal destruction by the japanese after the end of the second world war in  hong kong earned much by resuming its role as an entrepôt from  to  its earnings by reexportation rose by over half every year this led to the restoration of the citys economy during this period most factories that were shut down during the japanese occupation period were reopened industrialisationedit industrialisation refers to hong kongs transformation from an entrepôt to an industrial city during the s and s this was also the first change in economic structure in hong kong history one cause of industrialisation was the korean war the united states embargo on china led to a decline in entrepôt trade with china hong kongs biggest market at the time this forced hong kong to focus on manufacturing instead moreover as chinas products could not be shipped to foreign countries hong kongs exports replaced chinas in  the united nations bought  ships from cheoy lee shipyard to help korea revive another factor was the chinese civil war after the second sinojapanese war chinese capitalists bought huge numbers of machines and facilities to restore their prewar production as the civil war broke out many capitalists moved those facilities to hong kong warehouses to continue production furthermore industrialists from tianjin shanghai and guangzhou relocated to hong kong because of the chinese civil war they brought skilled labour technology and capital to the city many mainlanders also fled to hong kong contributing to the citys labour supply altogether some us were brought to hong kong because of the war after the war the facilities and equipment stayed in hong kong causing the rise of hong kongs manufacturing industry from  to  the number of factories increased by  and  workers employed in the manufacturing sector the economic restructuring of more developed countries was another factor after the second world war richer capitalist countries started to upgrade their products and technology leaving labourintensive industries to the less developed countries this encouraged overseas investments and allowed developed technology to be imported to hong kong thereby boosting hong kongs manufacturing industry  to edit kwun tong industrial estate from  to  the rate of growth was relatively slow the number of factories increased from  to  while the number of workers employed in the manufacturing sector rose from  to  nevertheless the total value of domestic exports dropped from  to  hong kong dollars this was because the manufacturers focused on building factories and altering their products rather than increasing their productivity from  to  the rate of growth was faster the number of factories increased by  times while the number of factory workers increased  times however the value of domestic exports decreased from  to  in  for the first time the value of reexports exceeded that of exports by  the value of reexports had shrunk again to a third of that of exports during this time textile manufacturing and clothing industries took the lead the kwun tong industrial estate is the first industrial estate in hong kong by the early s hong kongs textile manufacturing industry was the most successful in asia the textile industry in particular flourished at the time chinese textile manufacturers set up many factories in tsuen wan some of them had dyeing factories and their own docks  to edit the industrialisation of hong kong was rapid from  through  preexisting industries continued to prosper while new industries emerged and blossomed as well the number of factories increased  times and the number of workers increased by  times the number of factories and workers in  were  and  respectively the latter took up over  of the citys employment structure the value of domestic exports continued to rise and in just two years rose by  times to hk hong kong was no longer reliant on reexportation and became an industrialised city one of the new industries that took the lead was the electronics industry which started to blossom in the s another industry was the watch industry hong kong manufacturers mainly made cheap watches and watch parts in the s likewise the toy industry started to succeed during this period the textile industry a preexisting industry continued to prosper from  to  another preexisting industry the clothing industry expanded greatly with higher technology clothing were exported to other places such as europe and north america the tai koo and hung hom bay shipyards were turned into housing estates while cheoy lee shipyard remained and became the first factory to produce boats with fibreglass hong kongs industrial areas expanded along victoria harbour during this period prior to the s most industrial areas were built along both sides of victoria harbour such areas have been turned into commercial or residential areas diversificationedit a map showing the four asian tigers from top to bottom south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore after hong kong became a fully industrialised city its economy faced two major crises in the s namely the oil crisis and the rise of other industrial states and cities with similar economic structures such as singapore south korea taiwan brazil and mexico the first three along with hong kong are known collectively as the four asian tigers before this the citys economy had faced little competition since hong kongs industrial development was earlier than the industrial development of most others to rescue the citys manufacturing industry several measures were taken first relatively new industries such as toy electronics and watches were developed quickly so that the clothing and textile industries no longer dominated the market this was also due to the fact that the western countries imposed severe restrictions on textile imports while toys electronics and watches enjoyed reduced tariffs in  hong kong replaced japan as the largest exporter of toys swiss watch companies also moved some of their factories to hong kong in addition the quality of products were upgraded the large number of cheap products were replaced by a smaller number of higher quality and valueadded products quality and technology of products were also increased as the competition increased the variety of products were widened hong kong companies also used flexible ways of producing goods faced with the severe restrictions of foreign countries companies made use of the diversity of their products so that another kind of products can be exported when one kind is restricted the high valueadded industry the jewellery industry started to emerge in the s places of origin of raw materials became more diversified for example hong kong bought raw material from taiwan singapore and korea to reduce reliance on japan the percentage of raw materials imported from european and american countries decreased while the overall percentage of raw materials from asia increased exportation was no longer limited to large countries such as the united states the united kingdom and west germany much effort was put to sell products to smaller countries although large countries still took up the majority more industrial estates and districts were built this was because there was insufficient land for industrial development leading to a rise in land rent in  every square metre of industrial land was sold at hk at auctions in this period the industrial areas were spread all over the city especially in the new territories where new towns such as tuen mun and shatin were built a hirepurchase plan was also adopted to relieve pressure from buying land for industrial uses hong kong managed to maintain its increasing manufacturing rate while diversifying its manufacturing industries in the s hong kongs factories increased from  to  the number of workers increased from  to  the value of domestic exports increased from  to  and increased by  every year the textile industry prospered during the s the city was the largest supplier of denim most of its manufacturers utilised shuttleless weaving machines and there were a total of  weaving machines shoemakers started to produce leather shoes rather than the cheap shoes in the s major clothing companies also emerged and quartz watches were first made during this period industrial relocationedit chai wan factory estate was constructed in  formationedit in the s the labourintensive industries of hong kong which depended on the citys low costs to remain competitive faced the problem of increasing land rents and labour costs moreover the increase of population did not suffice as the demand for products grew compared to the other three asian tigers hong kongs capitalintensive and technologyintensive industries were undeveloped and some less developed countries such as thailand malaysia and indonesia exceeded hong kong in the labourintensive field another problem was the increasing protectionism of western countries causing some privileges to be removed and extra restrictions placed on hong kong products meanwhile the economic reforms in mainland china provided a favourable condition for building factories there mainland china had labour and land and looser pollution control than hong kong the average daily wage of hong kong was hk in  compared to hk in guangdong in  mainland chinas infrastructure and facilities were less developed than hong kong further cutting costs it also has a lot of flat land for industrial development and a large local market therefore hong kong industrialists took advantage of mainland chinas pull factors by relocating their factories there most factories relocated to the pearl river delta the roads ports and communication networks of the pearl river delta were rapid and places such as guangzhou and foshan had good light industry bases according to government estimates among the relocated factories  of them relocated to guangdong from  to  among those  relocated to shenzhen and  to dongguan however industrial relocation was not limited to mainland china some industrialists relocated their factories to nearby countries such as thailand india the philippines myanmar bangladesh vietnam indonesia and malaysia two individual terms were coined the first made in hong kong refers to the process in which all power resources apart from raw materials exported from foreign countries labour capital design and management occur in hong kong and the products are either sold locally or exported overseas this system is a prerelocation manufacturing system the second made by hong kong refers to the process in which capital design management and office occur in hong kong however the power and labour are supplied from mainland china where the factories are located raw materials are transported to mainland china via hong kong the products are then shipped to overseas countries this system describes the system that the relocated factories follow the first factories were relocated to mainland china in the late s the relocation trend reached its peak in the mids by the s over  of the factories had been relocated to mainland china the value of domestic exports continued to decrease while that of reexportation from mainland china increased drastically in the toy industry only  of the value of exports was gained by domestic exports while  was reexported from mainland china from  to  the value of reexportation from mainland china increased by  annually on average in the s the jewellery industry moved most of their manufacturing process to mainland with the exception of the most valuable jewellery production nevertheless some factories remained in hong kong either because of importation quotas or limits on place of origin or because only hong kong had the technology required industries that produced a small number of highquality goods need not be relocated some factories also remained because they had overseas branches family workshops also stayed impactsedit industrial relocation has to some extent contributed to the upgrade of industries the labourintensive industries of hong kong were turned into capitalintensive and technologyintensive industries the relocated mainland factories became more effective than before their relocation thus increasing the productivity of the manufacturers from  to  the total amount made by such manufacturers rose from hk to hk products produced in the mainland are also more competitive due to low costs the environment of hong kong has improved while that of mainland china is heavily polluted the pearl river delta faced serious water pollution and much farmland was turned into industrial uses the primary industry of guangdong decreased from  to only  while that of the secondary industry rose from  to  from  to  the area of rice fields dropped by  consequently local governments of south china passed laws to restrict industrial pollution the livelihood of people in mainland china has improved many people no longer need to farm for a living in  over a million workers were employed by hong kong industrialists which increased to  million as of  in mainland china local governments in china earn money which are used to improve the infrastructure of china through land rent and taxes therefore the economy of the pearl river delta was boosted alongside the improvement of living standards as the manufacturing industry declined the tertiary industry rose the service sector continues to prosper to this day in  the tertiary sector took up only  of hong kongs employment structure by   of all employees worked in the service industry while employee rates of the manufacturing industry dropped to  the relocated factories needed support services including shipping insurance and above all finance due to more people working in the tertiary sector hong kongs economy grew increasingly reliant on service industries hong kong science park the finance and real estate industries bloomed in the s however the dependence on such industries caused a loss of competitiveness between products produced by hong kongbased manufacturers and those from the international market the other asian tigers had developed capitalintensive industries such as crude oil computers and heavy industries as a result the government of hong kong has tried to develop knowledgebased hightechnology and highervalueadded industries hightechnology training programmes have been provided as well as courses related to information technology and biotechnology land was used for hightechnology industries notably cyberport research centres have been set up to support such industries notably the hong kong science and technology park hightechnology exports took up onethird of hong kongs total exports in  manufacturing workers who are unskilled in other areas are unemployed as a result of industrial relocation to aid them the government provided retraining programmes allowing them especially those in the tertiary industry to get new jobs st centuryedit as of  the printing and publishing industry takes up  of the employment structure of the citys manufacturing sector followed by the food and beverage industry at  the textile clothing and electronic industries took up only   and  respectively the clothing industry accounted for  of the value of domestic exports of the manufacturing sector in  while the electronics industry took up  of it chemical products jewellery textiles and printing and publishing industries took up    and  respectively despite the relocation of light and labourintensive industries heavy industries are still rare in hong kong the large population of hong kong remains favourable for labourintensive industries the raw materials and products of light industries are easier to transport than the heavy industries and there is insufficient flat land in hong kong for heavy industries in the st century industrialists in shenzhen have expressed interest in cooperating with hong kong in hightechnology manufacturing industries they want to share businessrelated information with hong kong and use the citys financial services such as the electronics industry quaternary industries such as the software industry and tertiary industries such as environmental protection companies are also interested see alsoedit public factory estates in hong kong companies of hong kong references and footnotesedit footnotesedit  a

analysis from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from porter five forces analysis jump to navigation search a graphical representation of porters five forces porters five forces analysis is a framework for analyzing the level of competition within an industry and business strategy development it draws upon industrial organization io economics to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and therefore the attractiveness of an industry attractiveness in this context refers to the overall industry profitability an unattractive industry is one in which the combination of these five forces acts to drive down overall profitability a very unattractive industry would be one approaching pure competition in which available profits for all firms are driven to normal profit this analysis is associated with its principal innovator michael e porter of harvard university porter refers to these forces as the micro environment to contrast it with the more general term macro environment they consist of those forces close to a company that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a profit a change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to reassess the marketplace given the overall change in industry information the overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every firm in the industry will return the same profitability firms are able to apply their core competencies business model or network to achieve a profit above the industry average a clear example of this is the airline industry as an industry profitability is low and yet individual companies by applying unique business models have been able to make a return in excess of the industry average porters five forces include three forces from horizontal competition the threat of substitute products or services the threat of established rivals and the threat of new entrants and two forces from vertical competition the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers porter developed his five forces analysis in reaction to the thenpopular swot analysis which he found unrigorous and ad hoc porters five forces is based on the structure–conduct–performance paradigm in industrial organizational economics it has been applied to a diverse range of problems from helping businesses become more profitable to helping governments stabilize industries other porter strategic frameworks include the value chain and the generic strategies contents  five forces  threat of new entrants  threat of substitutes  bargaining

markets that yield high returns will attract new firms this results in many new entrants which eventually will decrease profitability for all firms in the industry unless the entry of new firms can be blocked by incumbents which in business refers to the largest company in a certain industry for instance in telecommunications the traditional phone company typically called the incumbent operator the abnormal profit rate will trend towards zero perfect competition the following factors can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose the existence of barriers to entry patents rights etc the most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low few new firms can enter and nonperforming firms can exit easily government policy capital requirements absolute cost cost disadvantages independent of size economies of scale economies of product differences product differentiation brand equity switching costs or sunk costs expected retaliation access to distribution customer loyalty to established brands industry profitability the more profitable the industry the more attractive it will be to new competitors network effect threat of substitutesedit the existence of products outside of the realm of the common product boundaries increases the propensity of customers to switch to alternatives for example tap water might be considered a substitute for coke whereas pepsi is a competitors similar product increased marketing for drinking tap water might shrink the pie for both coke and pepsi whereas increased pepsi advertising would likely grow the pie increase consumption of all soft drinks albeit while giving pepsi a larger slice at cokes expense another example is the substitute of a landline phone with a cellular phone potential factors buyer propensity to substitute relative price performance of substitute buyer switching costs perceived level of product differentiation number of substitute products available in the market ease of substitution substandard product quality depreciation availability of close substitute bargaining power of customersedit the bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs the ability of customers to put the firm under pressure which also affects the customers sensitivity to price changes firms can take measures to reduce buyer power such as implementing a loyalty program the buyer power is high if the buyer has many alternatives the buyer power is low if they act independently eg if a large number of customers will act with each other and ask to make prices low the company will have no other choice because of large number of customers pressure potential factors buyer concentration to firm concentration ratio degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution bargaining leverage particularly in industries with high fixed costs buyer switching costs relative to firm switching costs buyer information availability force down prices availability of existing substitute products buyer price sensitivity differential advantage uniqueness of industry products rfm customer value analysis the total amount of trading bargaining power of suppliersedit the bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs suppliers of raw materials components labor and services such as expertise to the firm can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes if you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour you have no alternative but to buy it from them suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources potential factors are supplier switching costs relative to firm switching costs degree of differentiation of inputs impact of inputs on cost and differentiation presence of substitute inputs strength of distribution channel supplier concentration to firm concentration ratio employee solidarity eg labor unions supplier competition the ability to forward vertically integrate and cut out the buyer industry rivalryedit for most industries the intensity of competitive rivalry is the major determinant of the competitiveness of the industry potential factors sustainable competitive advantage through innovation competition between online and offline companies level of advertising expense powerful competitive strategy firm concentration ratio degree of transparency usageedit strategy consultants occasionally use porters five forces framework when making a qualitative evaluation of a firms strategic position however for most consultants the framework is only a starting point or checklist they might use value chain or another type of analysis in conjunction like all general frameworks an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered naive according to porter the five forces model should be used at the lineofbusiness industry level it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level an industry is defined at a lower more basic level a market in which similar or closely related products andor services are sold to buyers see industry information a firm that competes in a single industry should develop at a minimum one five forces analysis for its industry porter makes clear that for diversified companies the first fundamental issue in corporate strategy is the selection of industries lines of business in which the company should compete and each line of business should develop its own industryspecific five forces analysis the average global  company competes in approximately  industries lines of businesscitation needed criticismsedit porters framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists such as stewart neill similarly kevin p coyne and somu subramaniam have claimed that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces that buyers competitors and suppliers are unrelated and do not interact and collude that the source of value is structural advantage creating barriers to entry that uncertainty is low allowing participants in a market to plan for and respond to competitive behavior an important extension to porter was found in the work of adam brandenburger and barry nalebuff of yale school of management in the mids using game theory they added the concept of complementors also called the th force helping to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market the idea that complementors are the sixth force has often been credited to andrew grove former ceo of intel corporation according to most references the sixth force is government or the public martyn richard jones whilst consulting at groupe bull developed an augmented  forces model in scotland in  it is based on porters model and includes government national and regional as well as pressure groups as the notional th force this model was the result of work carried out as part of groupe bulls knowledge asset management organisation initiative porter indirectly rebutted the assertions of other forces by referring to innovation government and complementary products and services as factors that affect the five forces it is also perhaps not feasible to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry independent of the resources a firm brings to that industry it is thus argued wernerfelt  that this theory be coupled with the resourcebased view rbv in order for the firm to develop a much more sound strategy it provides a simple perspective for accessing and analyzing the competitive strength and position of a corporation business or organization see alsoedit
