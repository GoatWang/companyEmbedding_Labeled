out this small cap german company tssf in this thread httpwwwcornerofberkshireandfairfaxcaforumgeneraldiscussionstocksyouownbutnotdiscussedonboardyetmsgmsg  i have digged into tss and find the company so solid and such a bargain that i believe it deserves its own thread and i am long tsswhy this is a great company for a fair price pe of  tss has steadily organically grown revenue  cagr and ebit over  cagr since  without practically missing a beat even through the credit crisis only  slightly interrupted the continuous growth and their business is products for the construction industry roic of no less than  every year since  virtually no debt no share dilution no share repurchase either though they are about to repay all their debt so are going into excess cashtss has two business segments where they design and manufacture entrance doors this is a consolidation of about three companies that make entrance doors they are a wholesale seller of the doors to fe architects formliners and moulds for patterned concrete the synergy is that both segments are sold to large contruction projects they sell their products worldwidei am not sure what the moat is of tss and why they are so profitable my take on this is that the ceo dr gerson link is a very conscientious capital allocator and does not waste mr link has been ceo with the company since  and owns  i have to guess his age because there is very little information that i can find about him on the picture in the annual report he looks something but that picture has not changed since  so my best guess is that he is something he should still have some runway to continue what he does wella minus is that the shares trade in very low volume a typical day trades  to  shares i did my purchases through interactive brokers at the frankfurt borseyou find the tss investor relation website with annual reportshttpwwwinnotectssdeinvestorrelationsberichtehtmltss spends minimal effort on communication to investors they do not seem to care all information is in german i understand a bit of german but had to use google translate to really go through the reports the google translation was not bad logged constructive

specified i dont know how far along the german construction industry is in online adoption but i suspect in most industries small companies will have an increasingly hard time keeping up with larger competitors with a stronger digital presencerodenberg doors look very niche and unsuitable for the large majority of applications for examplepolytec is more promising they have simple flush doors and decent looking traditional designsreckli actually has some nice looking stuff however i am not sure how differentiated form lining isthat said sounds like the price is right maybe these warts just represent upside once they fix them « last edit february    pm by constructive » logged rb hero member posts  re tssf  innotec tss ag « reply  on february    pm » firstly i want to commend farbelow for going through a whole annual report with google translate youre a trooper i cheated and used thomson not as accurate but good enoughnow from my knowledge of german construction products is that they tend to be very well engineered high quality and very expensive they get away with the pricing because they mainly fit two categories  they make installation much easier and reduce expensive contractor time or  they ensure you dont get some sort of failure and have to redo the job i can see these applying to the patterned concrete business not so much for the doors this is quite a small company with much bigger competitors so some things are a bit confusing how is this performance being achieved i dont think given their size that they can out rd their competitors in addition rd expense is basically nonexistent why is this company public arent these types of german companies usually private why is the company paying down debt so quickly when it is growing so much maybe im being picky with this one but its not exactly indicative of great capital allocationi also think that the key thing that makes this company so cheap is that growth rate if it continues then its a steal if it stops then no so much what peaked my interest looking at the financials is their sga line from the evolution it looks like the business is based on relationship sales maybe the past growth is due some personal relationships of management that enabled them to push product past competitors nothing wrong with that the question is can it continue as they grow larger and need to move more

perspectivegermany did not encounter a real estate boom pre  like other countries the property market was fairly muted back then however since  or  germans have been buying houses and flats like never before helped by zero interest rates and a generally sound economy since  real estate prices have risen by  my estimateclearly tss has benefitted from this trend and it is still intact but will not go on forever i think it is therefore not adequate to extrapolate growth rates from the past five years to the future as they have been unusually good for pretty much all propertyrelated businesses in

 other than germany exiting the euro  that keeps this re boom from expanding quite on the contrary german re is one of the few markets im bullish on we are not anywhere near exuberant levels but the interest rate environment strongly suggests that we might go there « last edit february    am by nico » logged nico hero member posts  re tssf  innotec tss ag « reply  on february    am » quote from

thank you for all the input that adds good color i was not aware of the real estate boom in germany interestingly enough it was exactly the other way around in the netherlands since  construction went down macro predictions aside i believe there are three things that support the case for tss in regard of growth they steadily grew  cagr revenue from  until  ie before the boom and when construction actually went down in germany they have steadily gone more and more internationali  doors making up  of their business  of their business is in the eu outside of germany practically nothing outside of the euii cement molds making up  of their business  of their businesss in in germany  in the eu outside of germany and  in the rest of the worldiii they just opened up an office in uae current price of  euro per share is about right if there would be no growth from here and  roic is high so growth adds good valuethe moat is a difficult call because there is so little information to go by i agree that probably a good part of the moat is personal sales by management which has limited scalability regarding capital allocation i agree that this is too conservative and therefore not great but i often see this with german companies as nico also attests i guess what i mean is that this management is not foolishly spending capital on goodwill to build an empire and they have repaid a mezzanine debt with merril lynch from  with  interest this seems wise of course tss could have rolled over this debt with other debt but as the old debt was mezzanine it must have been difficult to get that and they might be traumatised about debta risk is the excess cash coming up what is management going to do i think share repurchase is unlikely i hardly see that in germany are there rules against share repurchase in germany also there are two owners with each  is there a german law that kicks in from  ownership this might be an extra reason they do not repurchase shares logged nico hero member posts

certain percentage at once out of the top of my head i think its  from a tax perspective you lose some flexibility to sell your shares once youve crossed  further shareholders with more than  share are able to veto important corporate decisions spinoffs etc a very important hurdle is  because if you cross it youll be obligated to make a tender offer to the other shareholders to buy their shares

estate bubble yet but in an expanding boom which may go further from this is in fact what bundesbank appers to see aswell httpwwwbundesbankderedaktionenredendombrethtmli think any kind of macro predictions are difficult rates are at postwar lows most people think that will remain the case but i cannot determine for how long i can see that real estate is not as cheap as it was five years ago household formation in germany is not as positive as in the us and german population is projected to shrink over the next thirty years though this may or may not be balanced by immigrants so medium to long term german housebuilding may look worse than it does at the moment but there may be a few bright years before that it is nothing i would bank on but it is possiblei just think it is wrong to use the growth rate of the past five years to eternity and it seems like people on the forum agree on that logged print pages     go up « previous next » corner of berkshire  fairfax message board »

software solution for consolidation planning reporting and analysis check balances all the way down to the individual document level improve data transparency and reliability lucanetfinancial consolidationlucanetplannerweve been successful with lucanet for many years and thanks to so many easytouse features as well as excel integration we have already improved many processes such as reporting reconciliation reports postings etc in a short amount of time as a publicly listed company with nine subsidiaries we believe this software is practically unrivalled on the market thanks to its excellent value for money flexibility and userfriendlinessabout the companyindustryholding company specialising in the structural engineering industryheadquartersdüsseldorf  germanyemployees  innotec tss ags old excelbased reporting and consolidation tools were no longer meeting the companys needs the data that the company was using for preparing consolidated statements was overly prone to errors and too complicated thanks to lucanet software innotec has completely reorganised controlling and consolidation lucanet brings transparency and clarityinnotec tss ag is a holding company specialising in construction the group of companies is a national leader in external door panels an international leader in form liners for exposed concrete surfaces and a global partner for elastomeric spring systems for civil engineering applications the company places very high standards of performance on its subsidiaries and service partners are also expected to meet these exacting requirements as a result when it was time to replace ms excel for consolidation and planning the company needed a software solution that would meet all these strict standardsconsolidation and planning reorganisedour requirements for the software were clearly defined it had to be transparent reliable and selfexplanatory thats what we expected from the software lucanet combines all these features in one logically organised system says antje hansal in charge of group accounting at innotec tss ag the software was quickly and easily linked to the source systems nav and axapta another key requirement for the software is that it must allow old excel files to be easily imported and exported and existing excel reports to be usedpositive results in many areasever since the new software was implemented data quality has improved because data can now also be used for controlling purposes and the individual financial statements of the individual companies can be used transparency and reliability have also improved dramatically this is primarily because the system allows balances to be checked all the way down to the individual document level already processed periods can also be closed thereby preventing further changes we are successfully using the software for presenting the consolidated financial statement displaying metrics and all analyses as well as for preparing parallel hgb and ifrscompliant balance sheets thanks to the softwares planning forms and wizards not to mention lucanets integration with excel we also improved the transparency of our planning data says antje hansal describing the advantages of the software the software is also outstanding for our consolidation projects we regularly perform multilevel consolidations that must take into account minority
