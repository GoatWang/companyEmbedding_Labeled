frosty step up on may   amin business news by tonycomments by emeka anaeto business editor investors in the nigerian stock exchange nse last week took some frosty steps towards the stock of one of nigeria’s leading indigenous oil sector conglomerates forte oil plc fo moving the share price by  per cent in just two consecutive trading dates the fastest since the company’s last results announcement first quarter  q’ however it remains to be seen how far they can go this week in sustaining their bull run as it closed flat last friday just a day after the twoday push the investors have been rather fainthearted over the company’s q’ results on the back of persisting pressures from the operating environment consequently a near price stagnation and some reversal of gains have been recorded since mid last month until last week’s shortlived bull stunt stockbrokers believe the push last week was a fall out of the pervading band wagon effect of the general bullish trend that hit the market three weeks ago on the heels of many impressive corporate results announcement and the general expectation that economic rebound was around the corner but same brokers are also foreseeing profit taking reversing the capital gains in most of the stocks any moment from this week and this may also effect fo it it moves further up judging from its fundamentals indeed some investment analysts reversed their target price tp for fo stock based on both the sector outlook and the company’s result q’ performance review forte oil plc fo one of the nigeria’s leading indigenous oil sector conglomerates reported a  yearonyear yoy decline in its first quarter  q’ turnover to n billion at the backdrop of a significant sales decline in its cash cow product line premium motor spirit petrol division however the company recorded a strong revenue growth in the power  yoy and lubricant  yoy segments against q’ records of  and  respectively it is believed the power and lubricant segments’ performance was buoyed by stronger pricing in the divisions consequently the increased contributions from the higher margin businesses beefed up gross margin for the period to  from  in q’ the company’s earnings also got a boost from conservative opex headings with the impact of the improvement in gross margin further strengthened by a sizable improvement in operating expenses as earnings before interest and tax ebit margin rose to  as against q’ position of  and fy’ position of    opex to sales ratio was down to  q’  fy’  on the back of a sizable reduction in freight costs  although the company’s operating performance was quite impressive especially in light of the tough operating environment q’ bottom line received an additional boost from a lower effective tax rate of  as against   q’ and fy’ rates of  and  respectively consequently the company reported an aftertax profit of n billion in q’ –  yoy growth  outlook still hazy  had been a mixed bag of fortune for the petroleum marketing sector as retail price mark up earlier in the year heralded opportunity for bottomline growth but this came at the backdrop of a pressured purchasing power forcing down general demand while impacting volume of sales in the petroleum products adversely this situation was further compounded by the naira devaluation along with foreign exchange supply constraint a development which effectively knocked out the ability of oil marketers to import and sale their products the situation was also compounded by the perennial indebtedness of government to the marketers on the outstanding subsidy claims which compounded the debt burdens of the marketers to their bankers fo operated under this industry challenges last year though some analysts see industry dynamics likely to be different this year given the central bank’s increased ability and willingness to provide forex concerns regarding the current pricing template exist whilst the government is not expected to increase pump price some stakeholders in the template are demanding increased margin at least the logistics group has gotten away with a promise to effect such without concomitant increase in pump price consequently the federal government will persist with its modulated pricing mechanism for as long as it is possible if this is not sorted out participation of fo and other marketers in importation of products may still be restricted through the year some analysts believe that since local refining capacity remains lackluster increased competition and lower unit volume sales would continue in addition diesel kerosene and aviation fuel prices have somewhat moderated relative to the last quarter this analysts believe would lead to a significant drop in revenue from fo’s petroleum division to n billion for full year  fy’ power segment to remain upbeat power segment to benefit from overhaul improved gas supply and recent reforms a reasonable level of stability has returned to the gas supply and consequently power generation sector at the backdrop of the overhauled and increased facility capacity run by fo power consequently the management has set a capacity utilisation target of  some analysts see revenue from the power division skyrocketing to n billion with the sector’s contribution to overall revenues rising to  from  in fy’ but it is not yet clear how settlement issues would be resolved this year though federal government appears to be intervening in the power sector liquidity crises outstanding debt for  was estimated at n billion as distribution companies discos settled only n billion from a total invoice of n billion it is only hoped that the power assurance guarantee should address this situation when it eventually kicks off chemicals lubricant segment still challenged some analysts had hoped that with a sustained uptick in crude oil prices activities would pick up in the upstream sector where fo chemical business is hinged but this has not yet happened five months into the year and season of oil price uptick the exploration  production companies are believed to be frostyfooted on capital expenditure and ep due to equally frosty outlook of the implementation of the country’s new energy policy initiatives but fo’s management according to the observers is believed to be on the pursuit of opportunities with new and existing clients however due to the many uncertainties it is estimated that a  drop in revenue may be recorded from its production chemicals division to n billion during the year meanwhile the lubricant business segment is expected to continue to benefit from the naira devaluation which curbed imports from asia and allowed local producers to increase prices and run on better margin therefore over  rise in revenue from this segment is expected in the year analysts’ projections and valuation against the backdrop of a mixed operating environment analysts at cardinal stone partners limited a lagos based investment house has this to say concerning the outlook for fo in  “we expect aggregate revenue to remain flat with the anticipated rise in revenue from the power and lubricant divisions just sufficient enough to stem the weakness in contributions from the fuel and production chemicals division we therefore project a  yoy drop in revenue to n billion “production costs as a percentage of sales dropped to  from  in q’ and barring any material devaluation we expect gross margin to improve to  from  in fy’ “net finance costs should rise by  to n billion and could increase further if the company is able to raise the additional tranches of its n billion bond issuance program within the year we think new capital raising requirements may be on the horizon “the nigerian electricity regulatory commission nerc is set to release a minimum recapitalization level required to be met by core investors in the power sector details are sketchy but investors that fail to meet this criterion will need to shore up the capital base with debt or equity contributions “we project a  rise in net profit to n billion we have revised our target price to n previous n due to the impact of a reduction in aggregate revenue and earnings growth over our fiveyear forecast horizon”   tony view all posts by tony → disclaimer comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard
