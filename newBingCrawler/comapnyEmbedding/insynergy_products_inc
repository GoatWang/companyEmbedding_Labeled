(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. We also urge you to review and consider our disclosures describing various risks that may affect our business, which are set forth under the heading "Risk Factors," below.  Executive Overview  Insynergy Products Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010. The Company was organized to engage in Direct Response marketing that has the ability to take a product from the drawing board to the ultimate consumer via sales through television, Internet and retail.  The Company's management believes the Direct Response market to be a booming business that has evolved during the past two decades from an entrepreneurial industry to one that now encompasses the marketing efforts of a vast number of companies to produce sales of a myriad of products. According to the Electronic Retailing Association (www.retailing.org), the only trade association that represents larger companies in the direct-to-consumer marketplace, this is an estimated more than $300 billion market. Management believes, but cannot assure, that this is a reasonable assessment of the size of this market.  Direct Response Marketing  Direct Response Marketing generally takes the form of the marketing and sale of products utilizing infomercials which are broadcast over local television channels, paired with a Call Response Center which takes the calls generated by potential purchasers who call in after viewing the infomercial, and a fulfillment center, which ships out the product.  The infomercial is designed to solicit a direct response in the target audience which is specific and quantifiable. The delivery of the response is directly between the viewer and the advertiser, that is, the customer responds to the marketer or its agent directly. In direct marketing (such as telemarketing), there is no intermediary broadcast media involved. In Direct "Response" Marketing, marketers use broadcast media to encourage customers to contact them directly. This direct response marketing seeks to elicit action. Marketing results from a Direct Response Marketing Program can be tracked, measured, and quantified.  Direct Response Marketing is characterized by:  *  An offer of a specific product or combination of products  *  Sufficient information for the consumer to make a decision whether to act and buy  *  An explicit "call to action"  *  Provision of a means for buy response (typically multiple options such as toll free number, web page, and email)  Direct Response Marketing Products  Direct Response Marketing is often used for new and innovative products that can be demonstrated and shown to make life easier or better, or products which solve a specific problem the target audience may have.  Health and fitness products, skin, hair and personal care products, nutritional supplements, house wares and appliances, have all been successfully marketed.  Our Company selects products invented by others for use in a Direct Response Marketing Program, but we also develop our own products for sale as well. We will analyze each product presented to us to see if it looks like it would be an attractive candidate for a direct marketing campaign. We will look for products which satisfy a specific need that can be concretely presented in the infomercial, lend themselves to generation of a call for action motivation in the target audience, provide for a substantial markup on the sales price over their cost (typically somewhere in the realm of a 5 to 1 markup), have a lower range target price in order to encourage immediate discretionary purchase, and have anticipated staying power as a useful product which the Company can sell over and over again.  We will license products from the inventor or owner of the product, with license fees paid on collected revenue from the sales of the product, net of returns and allowances. Typical license fees run between 2% and 4% of net sales for sales generated over television and the internet, and if the Company is able to then take the product for distribution to traditional brick and mortar outlets for further sales, an increased license fee of between 4% and 6% is typically paid. The license rights typically run for between 24 and 36 months, and are generally renewable. Products may or may not have patent protection, copyright protection, and/or trademark protection.  Initial Products to Be Marketed  During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company entered into eight new licensing agreements with various third parties. The Agreements were with Shifferaw LLC, Hanamade, Concept One International, Charles Perez, Pineapple Planet, Inc. and Guinness Design, LLC. Of the eight Agreements, we have already produced two television spots, Best Ball (Concept One International) and Scrub n Slide (Charles Perez). We have tested both spots and will be making some changes to both. The remaining six products are still in the development stage.  Two of the current products selected by the Company are in the area of fitness and we have executed licensing agreements for both products. One product is a fitness product called the Best Ball. The Best Ball is a 65cm rubber gym ball which provides progressive stability and progressive resistance. Using it may increase core strength, balance and flexibility. A workout DVD and pump is included in the package.  We have a License Agreement for the Best Ball covering World Wide rights through the term of the License Agreement, giving us the exclusive Worldwide right to advertise, promote, market, manufacturer, distribute, sell and exploit the product in any and all media, means, markets and channels of trade and distribution. The initial term may be renewed annually provided a minimum number of units are sold at a minimum price over each period. Management believes the Company's net profit may range up to 40%, but there is, of course, no assurance that the product will be successful or produce significant profits.  The other product to be released by Insynergy is a patented fitness product called Spidercore which was invented by a medical doctor who developed it because he was not satisfied with the physical therapy he was receiving after back surgery and felt he could develop a better protocol. It will come with a basic workout DVD. Additional DVD's will be available for more advanced workouts. We have gone to a third party to test Spidercore for 10 weeks with very positive results. Many of the participants in this program have lost both weight and inches. We have shot video testimonials and will incorporate this footage into the 30 minute infomercial to be shot in the near future.  Our exclusive License Agreement gives us worldwide rights to advertise, promote, market, manufacture, distribute, sell and/or exploit the product in any and all media, means and markets and all channels of trade and distribution now known or hereafter devised. The term extends through October 16, 2017 provided that a minimum number of units have been sold by October 16, 2014 and that a minimum number of units are sold year 3, year 4 and year 5.  During the first quarter of 2014 the Company shot a two minute television spot for our plumbing product called Plumber's Hero designed to clear most normal clogs in your kitchen sink, bathroom sink, tub, shower and toilet. It even is designed to work through disposals. This product is made entirely in the US. This product was developed by the Company and, therefore, gives us worldwide rights. The product is currently being manufactured and a marketing campaign is planned for the fourth quarter of 2014. We are currently running our two minute spot on television and we are presenting Plumber's Hero to many of the top retailers in the US. To date, the reaction from these retailers has been very favorable and we are going through the process of becoming a vendor with them.  Another product expected to generate revenue in early 2015 is a hair care product called American Blowout that straightens curly and frizzy hair and, we believe, will be effective for a two to three month period. We anticipate shooting a 30 minute infomercial in early 2015 to market this product.  Results of Operation for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013  Revenues  For the three months ended September 30, 2014 the Company recorded revenues of $4,662 compared to $9,613 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. Cost of goods sold was $664, compared to $36,213 in the prior period. In the prior year revenue was generated from the sale of The Kruncher, a product which has since been discontinued, while in the current period revenue was generated from our new Plumbers Hero product. In the prior period cost of goods sold included $33,938 of impairment expense for the write down of inventory.  Operating Expenses  For the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred compensation expense of $39,561 compared to $68,707 for the three months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $29,146.  For the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred $10,171 in advertising and promotional expense as compared to $136,581 for three months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $126,410, or 92.5%. The decrease is a result of the timing of spending on promotional activities for the Company's many new products.  For the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred $23,025 in professional fees compared to $19,415 in the prior period. Professional fees are mainly for accounting, auditing and legal services associated with our quarterly filings as a public company.  For the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred $305,525 in general and administrative expense as compared to $122,842 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $182,683. The increase can be attributed to an increase in non-cash expense of stock issued for services.  For the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded a net loss of $379,498 as compared to a net loss of $409,892 in the prior period, a $30,394, or 7.5% decrease. The decrease in net loss can be attributed to a $35,259 loss on the disposal of asset that was recorded in the prior year increasing that period's loss.  Results of Operation for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013  Revenues  For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 the Company recorded revenues of $7,877 compared to $23,421 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Cost of goods sold was $3,584, compared to $53,655 in the prior period. In the prior year revenue was generated from the sale of The Kruncher, a product which has since been discontinued, while in the current period revenue was generated from our new Plumbers Hero product. In the prior period cost of goods sold included $45,397 of impairment expense for the write down of inventory.  Operating Expenses  For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred compensation expense of $165,644 compared to $216,207 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $50,563 or 23.3%. In mid-2013 the Company's officers agreed to reduce their salaries.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred $77,263 in advertising and promotional expense as compared to $205,966 for nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $128,703, or 62%. The decrease is a result of the timing of spending on promotional activities for the Company's many new products.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred $54,434 in professional fees compared to $312,420 in the prior period. In the prior year the Company issued stock for legal services in the amount of $250,000. Professional fees are mainly for accounting, auditing and legal services associated with our quarterly filings as a public company.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Company incurred $483,995 in general and administrative expense as compared to $380,013 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $103,982 or 27%. The increase can be attributed to an increase in non-cash expense of stock issued for services.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded a net loss of $791,709 as compared to a net loss of $1,064,391 in the prior period, a $272,682 or 25.6% decrease. The decrease can be largely attributed to the $250,000 stock for services expense incurred in the prior year and lower compensation expense.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 the Company relied upon advances from management and proceeds from notes payable for operations. In addition, the Company issued shares of common stock for services and cash (See Part II, Item 2, below.)  During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, net cash used by operating activities was $344,472 compared to $521,937 for the same period in the prior year.  Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were $396,883 compared to $512,076 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We received $75,000 from the issuance of 210,898 shares of common stock, $10,400 from advances from an officer and $376,847 from the issuance of notes payable.  The Company needs to locate investment capital sources and raise privately $1,000,000 which will be used for product testing, product manufacture, video production, air time purchase, and operation of the initial marketing campaigns, and for overhead expenses and working capital.  Obligations and Commitments  On January 7, 2014, the Company received $35,000 from Paul Berchin for a short term loan to assist in funding operating costs. The loan accrues interest at 6% and is due on demand.  During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company issued three separate promissory notes to Kenneth Tran, a non-related third party, totaling $84,000. The loans are uncollateralized, bear interest at 3% and mature in six months.  On July 9, 2014, the Board of Directors approved an investment arrangement with Steven Chao, a non-related third party. Per the terms of the agreement the investor has transferred $150,000 to the Company for which he is now entitled to the following. $1 per Spidercore unit sold through all retail outlets including online and retail shopping shows until the investment is paid back in full. Once the original investment is recouped the investor shall then receive a 2% royalty in perpetuity on all future retail sales of the Spidercore product.  On October 3, 2014, the Company executed a promissory note with Kenneth Tran for $50,000. The note bears interest at 3% and matures in six months. This loan was converted to common stock on October 8, 2014.  On October 20, 2014, the Company executed a promissory note with Kenneth Tran for $69,000. The note bears interest at 3% and matures in six months. This loan was converted into 363,158 shares of common stock.  As of December 31, 2013 the Company owed its CEO, Sandy Lang $32,500. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, he advanced the Company an additional $10,400 and was repaid $32,900, leaving a balance due as of September 30, 2014 of $10,000.  Going Concern  We have been the subject of a going concern opinion by our independent auditors who have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $5,484,814 as of September 30, 2014 and had a net loss of $791,709 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The Company is dependent on obtaining additional working capital in order to continue to implement our business plan and our product campaign, and the source, availability and terms for such additional capital are uncertain at this date. If such additional capital is not obtained, and/or if the products selected for marketing prove to be unsuccessful, the Company may fail and be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company's financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. This need for additional capital and the uncertainty of obtaining such capital, along with other factors, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Assurances cannot be given that adequate financing can be obtained to meet our capital needs, which we estimate at a minimum of $1,000,000.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.  We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.  Emerging Growth Company  We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the recently enacted Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will not be required to:   Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;   Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency"   Obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and   Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-11 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carry-forward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carry-forward Exists. An unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carry-forward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carry-forward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carry-forward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carry-forward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether a deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at the reporting date. This Update applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carry-forward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carry-forward exists at the reporting date. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.  The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares.


There is significant competition in the Direct Response industry from both 
small and large companies since there are really no barriers to entry.  As 
a result, there are literally hundreds of direct response companies that 
operate in the US and off a wide variety of products across all categories 
of consumer goods. 

The Company will have to rely on the skills of its management to pick 
products which produce successful direct response marketing campaigns 
and ultimately profits to the Company.


Company Description
The Company is a development stage company that is in the process of 
implementing its business plan, but has had no revenues to date.  We are 
not a blank check Company and have no plans or intention to engage in a 
merger or acquisition with an unidentified company, companies, entity or 
person,


 nor do we nor any of our affiliates intend for the Company, once 
it is publicly traded, to be used as a vehicle for some other private 
company to become a publicly traded company. 

Insynergy Products, Inc. (formerly Insynergy, Inc.) (the "Company") was 
incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010 to engage in Direct 
Response retail marketing and sale of  consumer products through Television 
and the Internet, followed up for successful products with more traditional 
distribution and sale of such products through traditional retail outlets, 
once a brand for the product has been established. 

Our current headquarters are located at 4705 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Suite 205, 
Studio City, CA 91607. Our website is located at www.insynergyproducts.com. 
Our telephone number is (818)760-1644.
