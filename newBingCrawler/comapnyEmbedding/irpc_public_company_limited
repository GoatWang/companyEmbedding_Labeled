Green ABS is an innovation of ABS resin as a result of discovery and research to replace synthesis rubber (butadiene) with natural rubber in ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) manufacturing process. IRPC is pioneer and be the first one who could produce ABS with natural rubber. The technique has been developed and tested by IRPC Research and Development division. Green ABS resin is suitable for environment concern and the community, country. As the result, of natural rubber replacement can reduce the use of synthesis rubber (butadiene) which reduces butadiene imported from abroad.

For your life and asset safety, IRPC has developed a fire prevention products, useful in many applications such as E&E appliance, offering automation and automotive, offers our customers in plastic resin form and additive form.
- Flame retardant resin, include ABS, HIPS and PP all are certified as UL - 94 standard by Underwriters Laboratories Inc, USA. 
- Anti-dripping Additive (PTFE Core-Shell) are additives that prevent dripping of melt polymer on fire. IRPC developed Anti-dripping Additive by nanotechnology. In addition to anti-dripping additive for polymer flame retardant grade rating V-1, V-0 and 5V (UL-94), they are excellent in term of easy to handle and storage at ambient temperature, excellent dispersion characteristics in compounds of a wide variety of polymers such as ABS, PBT, PET, HIPS, PC, PE, PP and etc.

New development from IRPC that gathering nano-technology chemical to our production, aimed to meet a health care concern. At present, some tiny organism called "bacteria" has been improving themselves to grow and alive in varied environments. Self protection against bacterial is one method to have a better health and sanitation. 
Therefore, IRPC developed our products featuring inhibit and eliminate bacteria and fungi, which have been certified the properties by MTEC, Thailand one of leading laboratory. It could be harmoniocsly used in all kind of plastic production in daily life such as food packaging, furniture, 
sanitary ware products, house-holds, diaper and toys etc.

Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) is white powder and a unique polymer with outstanding physical and mechanical properties. Most notable are its chemical inertness, lubricity, impact resistance, and abrasion resistance.
UHMW-PE is used for a wide variety of products such as machining including chain guides, worm gears, side protection guides on conveyor belts, rollers that do not need ball bearings, liner for silo/hopper and others. It can be formed by compression molding or RAM extrusion.

Acetylene Black is a carbon black produced through self-heating pyrolysis of acetylene gas, which requires no oxygen for reaction. Therefore, it is highly pure, the amount of hydrogen existing therein as undecomposed residual matter or as a functional group is extremely small, and functional groups containing oxygen are not found. It is composed of larger crystallite forms, longer chain structure and has less impurity than other carbon black. These unique properties result in high electrical and thermal conductivity, low moisture absorption, and high liquid absorption.
