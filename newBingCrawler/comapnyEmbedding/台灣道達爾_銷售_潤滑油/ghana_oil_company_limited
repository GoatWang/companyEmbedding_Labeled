History[edit]
GOIL was incorporated as a private limited liability company on June 14, 1960 as AGIP Ghana Company Limited with the objective of marketing petroleum products and related products particularly fuels, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), lubricants, bitumen, and speciality products in Ghana.[2] The shareholders were AGIP SPA of Italy and SNAM S.P.A. On the 16th of December 1968, SNAM S.P.A. transferred its 10% shareholding representing 95,000 shares to Hydrocarbons International Holdings of Zurich, Switzerland.[2] The Government of Ghana in 1974 acquired the shares of AGIP SPA and Hydrocarbons International Holdings in AGIP Ghana Company Limited and by a special resolution in 1976 changed the name of the Company to Ghana Oil Company Limited.[2] By a shareholders resolution passed on August 1, 2007 the Company adopted new regulations and was converted into a public Company.[2]
On 4 June 2015, a GOIL fuel station in Accra exploded. The station had been used as a shelter for victims of the 2015 Accra floods, and the disaster was compounded by floodwaters as gas floated and spread. The death toll was at least 150 people.
Operations[edit]
The Company's main business is marketing and distribution of petroleum products in Ghana. The biggest chunk of its sales comes from the sale of Diesel and Gasoline.[2] The Company is manned by a ten-member management team headed by the Managing Director.[2][3]
These offices also serve as distribution points for the company’s products. However, the main distribution points for fuels are Liaison Office, Central Depot, and the Accra Plains Depot all within the Tema catchment area, and the Takoradi Depot.[2][3]
GOIL has the largest retail network across Ghana. The company also has numerous consumer outlets throughout Ghana.[2][3] The consumer outlets include companies, schools, hospitals, factories, hotels, banks and major parastatals.[2] In addition, GOIL has a number of other retail outlets established to market premix fuel and kerosene to rural areas in Ghana.[2][3] LP Gas filling plants have also been installed at some of the filling and service stations and at other locations in Ghana.[2][3]
Currently, GOIL's technical partners are ENI SPA (AGIP) of Italy.[2]

Location of Ghana


Ghana is a unitary presidential constitutional democracy, located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean, in the subregion of West Africa. Spanning a land mass of 238,535 km², Ghana is bordered by the Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, Togo in the east and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south.
A multicultural nation, Ghana has a population of approximately 27 million, spanning a variety of ethnic, linguistic and religious groups.[1] Five percent of the population practices traditional faiths, 71.2% adhere to Christianity and 17.6% are Muslim. Its diverse geography and ecology ranges from coastal savannahs to tropical jungles. Ghana is a democratic country led by a president who is both head of state and head of the government. Ghana's economy is one of the strongest and most diversified in Africa, following a quarter century of relative stability and good governance.[2] Ghana's growing economic prosperity and democratic political system have made it a regional power in West Africa.[3]

The shareholders were AGIP SPA of Italy and SNAM S.P.A.
On the 16th of December 1968, SNAM S.P.A. transferred its 10% shareholding representing 95,000 shares to Hydrocarbons International Holdings of Zurich, Switzerland.

Message from our Group C.E.O. / M.D 
  
We salute our cherished customers for their loyalty to our brand. As the foremost indigenous Ghanaian Oil Marketing Company, GOIL is proud of its achievements. We are now the country's leading Oil Marketing Company. We have been recognized by the Ghana Investment Promotions Centre, GIPC, the Chartered Institute of Marketing Ghana, CIMG, Association of Ghana Industries, AGI, Ghana Entrepreneurs Association, and many other prestigious bodies and national organizations. We have achieved these without sacrificing health and safety standards as well as the quality of our products. GOIL means business and we have taken a significant step in attaining ISO certification and ratification. The future looks bright as we take giant steps in expanding aviation fuel facilities, investing in Bunkering storage, and the building of Liquefied Natural Gas and Bitumen plants. We believe that with the continued support of Ghanaians through the use of their purchasing power, GOIL will continue to grow to become a successful Multinational Oil Company.

Our Track record

GOIL has over the years made significant strides in transforming itself from a near-moribund state enterprise to become the number one Oil Marketing giant in the country. The first significant step was the restructuring of the company from a state-owned one into a public-listed entity. Through the visionary leadership of the Board, management and the commitment of workers, GOIL was listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange in 2007. Over the past five years GOIL has recorded key milestones which have resulted in several accomplishments. Key among them is the rebranding of the company in 2012 which involved the changing of the company’s corporate logo, the adoption of a new slogan ‘Good energy’ and the complete face- lifting and revamping of existing stations as well as the expansion of the number of service stations. Another milestone has been the achievement of ISO certification which was ratified in 2012
