In our bid to carve a niche as a manufacturer and marketer of reliable, efficient and high quality lubricants and oil products, we established a technical trading relationship with Castrol BP in 1991 â€“ the pioneers in global lubricant technology and specialty chemicals. This relationship gave rise to a distributorship agreement and an exclusive right to import and market Castrol products in Nigeria and the ECOWAS sub-region. Today, our lubes blending plant is the third plant in Africa with a state-of the-art laboratory to exclusively manufacture Castrol products and will be the only one to cater for the West African markets. We have also significantly, expanded our retail network in the coastal areas in order to enhance our cashflows and profitability with the following acquisitions:    A Coastal Tank Farm in Lagos with a capacity of 34 million Litres;  An Aviation Fuel Depot at the Bill Clinton Drive, within the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja  Development of a Coastal Storage facility in Ikot Abasi, Akwa Ibom State to serve the petroleum products needs of the Eastern and Southern markets.  Roll-out of several filling stations across the country.
