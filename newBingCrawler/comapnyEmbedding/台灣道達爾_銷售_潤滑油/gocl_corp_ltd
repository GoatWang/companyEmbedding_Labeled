REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 1. Your Directors have pleasure in presenting their Fifty Fourth Annual Report and Audited Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2015.2. DIVIDEND The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of Dividend of Rs. 2.00 per share (Rs. 2.50 per share, including Special Dividend of Rs. 0.30 equivalent to 15% on the occasion of Demerger of Lubricants Division) on the Paid Up Capital of the Company. The dividend of Rs. 11.90 crores (Rs. 24.79 crores), if approved by the Shareholders at the Fifty Fourth Annual General Meeting, will be paid out of the profits for the current year to all Shareholders of the Company whose names appear on the Register of Members as on the date of the Book Closure. 3. OPERATIONS The total turnover of the Company was Rs. 116.10 crores ( previous year Rs. 1100.22 crores ). The profit before exceptional items and taxation was Rs. 31.62 crores (Rs. 87.48 crores). The profit before tax was Rs. 41.87 crores ( Rs. 78.83 crores ). The profit after provision for current tax of Rs. 8.74 crores and deferred tax of Rs. 2.45 crores was Rs. 30.68 crores ( Rs. 58.34 crores ) resulting in an EPS of Rs. 6.19 for the year ( Rs. 5.88 ). 4. DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCEDetonators and Accessories (Energetics) Domestic markets for explosives and detonators / accessories recorded a negative growth in 2014 – 15 mainly on account of slowdown in production in the metal sector, uncertainty in private coal mining and consequent over supply and price decline in the trade market. However, the gross turnover of the Division was at Rs. 79.99 crores as against Rs. 69.77 crores in the previous year. The Division has manufactured 53.75 million Detonators (92.42 million), 19.05 million meters of Detonating Cord (4.05 million meters), Explosives The production for the domestic market and sales of non–electric detonators was high along with underground products. But surface detonators and trade detonators were affected due to market conditions. Export production however, was increased for surface dets, detonating fuse and non–electrics as the demand was good. Overall the demand from the trade segment remained sluggish but larger mining projects' requirements were steady and fully met. Production of Special Products for Defence and Space applications increased and several new products were developed during the year. All these new products found acceptance from the defence laboratories and companies. Production of these items will be increased during the current year. The Division increased its focus on more value added products such as Raydets, E–dets and Cord Relays. The Company markets its Detonators and Accessories through IDL Explosives Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary. This arrangement has been necessitated on account of market conditions, as customers prefer to place combined orders for industrial explosives and accessories. Mining and Infrastructure Mining and Infrastructure suffered in the last 4 years due to various issues with the Government / regulatory bodies and our operation was scaled down drastically. Commencement of mining projects is expected to take more time and is largely dependent on Government policy announcements. However, events in 2014­ –15 have indicated that this sector being the life–line for the growth of the country, is going to be revived. During the year mining activity in parts of the country picked up with renewed business confidence and growing industrial activity. In this background, the Division had taken up a few infrastructure projects along with a mining contract for reputed industrial house and achieved a turnover of Rs. 19.10 crores with a profit of Rs. 5.79 crores for the year. The large equipment bank of excavators, heavy duty earth moving tippers, dozers, etc. which impaired during the last year in view of the bleak mining scenario, have now been sorted. The older equipment has been disposed and all the operating equipment are currently being put into use for various mining projects. Our current focus is in the mining areas in eastern India with large corporate where the Division had operations earlier. Other Business Groups The 4 Wind Mills ( 1 MW ) located at Ramagiri in Andhra Pradesh generated 33,100 units ( 1,44,307 units ). The Hyderabad factory received the benefit of the generation through the TRANSCO grid. Exports Export Sales of Explosive Accessories which declined to Rs. 9 crores in the previous year bounced back to Rs. 24.70 crores in the current year with the re–commissioning of the Detonating Cord production facility at Hyderabad. The Division is exploring higher volumes and new markets / opportunities to offset the high incidence of freight and handling costs on account of statutory compliances. 4.6 Property Development Bangalore: In the "Ecopolis" project, located at Yelahanka, Bangalore, out of the total built–up area of about 77.31 lacs sq. ft., the construction by the Developer Company ( "HRVL" ) has been completed to the extent of 14.54 lacs sq. ft. This comprises of one Main Building ( Block 3 ) plus a Multi–Level Car Park space. All MEP services such as lifts, internal and external electrical & plumbing and HVAC services have been installed and completed. The main trunk road within the site from Bellary Road till Block 3 is completed. The external facade works are under completion. Approvals for the start of construction of Block 2 are in place. Contract for the civil work has been finalized and excavation for start of the second block comprising of 10 lacs sq. ft. approx. is also completed. The Company has undertaken civil construction works to the extent of Rs. 9 crores in this project. During Q1 of 2015–16, the Company will be undertaking further civil works of Rs. 4 crores approx. Hyderabad:The Master Plan for the project has been drawn up by the Developer Company, Hinduja Estates Private Ltd. ( "HEPL" ) through reputed Architects. The development will be an Integrated Residential Commercial Township which will comprise of residential apartments, IT / commercial office spaces, Health care and educational areas. The development will also have areas for the hospitality industry. The Company has surrendered approximately 9 acres of land for development of new and widening of existing road to improve the infrastructure in the vicinity of the Hyderabad factory. For the areas surrendered Transferable Development Rights ( TDR ) and Impact fee concessions would be made available to the Company. In the quarter ended December 2014, the Company sold its share of Transferable Development Rights ( TDR ) to the Developer Company at a value of Rs. 922 lakhs. In the quarter ended March 2015, the Company earned further revenue of Rs. 350 lakhs, being the initial amount payable by the Developer Company towards remission of impact fees payable for approval of high rises. 5. OVERSEAS ACQUISITION In December 2012, the Company had acquired 100% stake in Houghton International Inc, in USA through its 100% subsidiary HGHL Ltd in the UK, which was reduced to 10% as a result of infusion of fresh capital by Gulf Oil International into the Houghton intermediary holding entity, as a measure of de–risking and de–leveraging. Simultaneously, the Company has been released of all its obligations to the lenders. The new investor has taken over the obligations for repayment of the $ 180 mn loan obligation.

The Company subsequently divested the shares of Gulf Ashley Motor Limited due to synergy issues. 15. OUTLOOK FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS The growth of the industrial sector in India is dependent on the large extent on mining. Mining constitutes 10 – 11% of the total industrial sector. The Government plans to increase GDP by 7 – 8%, and, therefore development and growth of basic industries such as iron and steel, cement, aluminum, copper, etc. have to be nurtured. Mining activities supporting these basic industries will therefore be in the Government focus, if GDP target of 7.5% annual growth is to be achieved. In fact, during 2014 – 15 the new Union Government's first year in office mining activities showed a marginal growth of 1.4% as against 0.6% negative in 2013 – 14.15.1 Detonators and Accessories The demand for explosives and accessories registered a contraction in volumes in 2014 – 15. With the growth of the economy in general & mining in particular demand pattern is expected to grow steadily in all coal and metal sectors. It is expected to grow around 50% over the next 4 /5 years. The products of the Division will, therefore, grow year on year. However, there is expected to be a change in product–mix as high volume trade items have changed to higher end initiating systems such as non electrics, electronic detonators due to the change in storage and licensing requirements for Ammonium Nitrate. The Division has also recorded healthy growth in export where the demand has increased especially in Africa, Middle East and East European countries. In the meantime, with intense follow up from the industry the Government of India has permitted export of explosives material from Chennai port in addition to Mumbai. This will help to improve the flexibility of availing vessels and reduce handling as well as freight cost. This will increase the competitiveness of exports. The improvement in production process and quality systems in the Hyderabad plant has helped to improve the demand for the products besides making them competitive. As a result, in the recent tenders from Coal India Limited, the major consumer of explosives and initiating devices in the country, the Company has won large orders compared to the previous years. The Company is poised to grow steadily over the next few years on the basis of favourable decisions from tender driven PSUs such as Coal India, Singareni Collieries, NMDC, etc. and large non–PSU organizations, supported by growth in export business. Special products for Defence and Space agencies along with sophisticated products such as the electronic detonator range would add to the business volumes of this Division. 15.2 Mining and Infrastructure The Division which has had rich exposure in providing support services to the mining industry with services such as mine planning, execution of mine plans, overburden removal, extraction of ore, crushing and grading of ore, etc. should be able to grow and recover its former activities levels. The Government has already fast tracked various mining related regulatory issues, a few actions are already visible but will take time to yield visible results. The Government has recently allotted / re–allotted coal blocks which were earlier cancelled by the Supreme Court. Most of these mines are expected to commence operations shortly giving ample opportunities for the Division. We expect the mine scenario in the country to grow at a healthy pace after nearly four years of downtrend. The Division is already tendering / quoting for projects over the last few months and should be able to finalise some of the projects during the year. In preparation for infrastructure work, which is also in the Government focus, the Division has started taking elevated road, bitumen roads and other building projects in order to qualify for larger projects. 15.3 Realty In Bangalore, with the completion of the first building and multi–level car park of 15.54 lakhs sq.ft., the 2nd Building of another 10 lakhs sq.ft. has been started. The elevated approach road to the 2 buildings is also in place. Marketing of the space in the first building will be completed in the coming year. Major initiatives for the economic development of the State announced by the new Telangana State Government such as industry specific clusters for IT, foundry, solar energy, cinema city, AIIMS, etc. is expected to increase the demand for realty space in Hyderabad. Planning work relating to the project is being modified anticipating the emerging demand pattern and approvals are being sought on sector–wise basis. Based on an assessment and feedback on current market needs, detailing for Phase 1 of 11 lakh sft, which will mainly be a residential development alongwith neighbourhood shopping, is being readied for statutory approvals. 16. RISKS & CONCERNS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Pursuant to the Companies Act 2013 and Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement, the Board has authorized the Audit Committee to review the risk management plan of the Company from time to time. The executive Management identifies, evaluates business risks from time to time and furnishes the same to the Audit Committee along with risk mitigation plan. The Audit Committee reviews and renders advice for minimizing adverse impact, if any. The key business risks identified by the Company and its mitigation plans are as under: 16.1 Environmental Risks Regular safety audits are carried out by internal safety audit teams and at regular intervals by external teams. General Safety Directions (GSDs) are strictly enforced in all factories and plants within the factories to ensure minimisation of risk. In addition, strict compliance of the requirements of the Explosives Act and Rules are ensured to protect the exposure of adjacent neighbourhoods to the explosives and accessories factories from undue risk. Operations are carried out to comply with emission, waste water and waste disposal norms of the local authorities of the respective factories. In addition, the Hyderabad Factory has implemented the Integrated Management System incorporating ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. 16.2 Operational Risk The Energetics Division operates in a highly regulated and licensed industry environment and amendment / revision in licenses are required based on expiry of the licenses and change in production capacity and process. Amended / revised licenses for increase in license capacity for any of the explosives products may get delayed temporarily or for long periods thereby limiting our ability to cater to any increase in demand for these products from our customers. Non–availability of licenses / approvals for expansion of new products could affect our future growth and expansion plans. The Division, therefore, ensures that approvals are applied for well in advance to avoid launch dates / export of products and active follow up is maintained to get approvals in time. Location Risks Manufacturing facilities of our major subsidiary, are spread across six States. The optimum locations for packed explosives unit is determined by the customer location and the source of raw material. The advantage of the location of bulk explosives units is optimized to be close to the customer location. With changes in sources of raw material our location may not continue to be optimal in comparison with the competition. Moreover, if there is a consolidation in the industry, and the size of each manufacturing units go up, we may be disadvantaged by being sub–optimal. Raw Materials Many of the inputs of the Company and its major subsidiary are imported, availability of which is affected by global market situations. Also, prices of such items are volatile. Timely availability of raw materials is critical for continuous plant operations. The Company seeks to mitigate the risk by entering into long–term relationship with global raw material suppliers, with suitable escalation clauses to ensure regular supplies. With crude oil prices showing an uptrend after an unexpected fall during the last six months or so, the raw material prices and input costs are expected to increase. The Company seeks to mitigate the risk by entering into long–term relationship with global raw material suppliers, with suitable escalation clauses to ensure regular supplies. 16.3 Market Risks: Markets The Company and its major subsidiary operate in highly competitive markets where competition from all India players as well as regional players is high. The Energetics Division which manufactures explosive accessories and the Mining and Infrastructure Division operate in tender–driven markets, sometimes with onerous and unreasonable performance clauses. Therefore, there is a risk of cost increases not possible to be passed on to ultimate consumers. Any reversal in growth trend in the economy in general and weak monsoons in particular, could affect demand and consequent deceleration in manufacturing industry Concentration of Customers The Mining and Infrastructure Division which currently undertakes mining services in coal, iron ore and limestone sectors, is exposed to business risks on account of non–availability of environmental clearances in time and lack of adequate infrastructure for dispatch of ores from the mine, especially during the rainy seasons. In view of this, detailed review of approvals and quality of infrastructure is carried out before undertaking mining service contracts. Both the Energetics and Mining & Infrastructure Divisions are operating in the mining and infrastructure sectors, dominated by the PSUs, where the tendering system is in vogue, with the attendant risks. Missing L1 to L3 status in these tenders might result in loss of business opportunities for extended periods for the relevant tender(s). 16.4 Financial Risks: Currency Value and Interest Rate Fluctuations Financial risk management is done by the Finance Department at the various business Divisions and at Corporate Office under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Policies for overall foreign exchange loss risks and liquidity are regularly reviewed based on emerging trends. Interests' risks arising out of financial debt, are normally done at fixed rates or linked to LIBOR and appropriate Bank lending rates. Adverse movement of Rupee from current levels may further impact base oil and ammonium nitrate rates. Credit Risk The Company and its major subsidiary sometimes sell its products by extending credit to customers, with the attendant risk of payment delays and defaults. To mitigate the risk, a credit risk policy is also in place to ensure that sale of products are made to customers after evaluation of their ability to meet financial commitments through allotment of specific credit limits to respective customers. Credit availability and exposure is another area of risk.Liquidity Risk The Company and its major subsidiary operate in working capital intensive industries. The Company realizes that its ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and others is linked to timely and regular collection of receivables and maintaining a healthy credit rating. Review of working capital constituents like inventory of raw materials, finished goods and receivables are done regularly by the respective Divisions and closely monitored by Corporate Finance. 16.5 Legal and Statutory Risks: Contractual Liability All major contracts are reviewed / vetted by the in–house Legal department before the same are executed. In addition, the Company engages the services of reputed independent legal counsels, on need basis. In matters of tax law and other statutory obligations the outcome of litigation cannot always be predicted. Hence, appropriate financial provisions, insurance policies and credit lines are taken to limit the risk for the Company. Litigation Risks: The Company is exposed to the risk of litigation of prolonged nature. Apart from the Tax Matters referred to in the Financial Statements, Litigations having a major impact on the Company include those with Udasin Mutt pertaining to leased lands of Hyderabad Works, Competition Commission of India, which are being pursued by the Company with the appropriate Court/ Tribunal. 16.6 IT Risks The Company is dependent on intra–office and inter–office networks, as well as several business software operated from the Corporate Office and the business Divisions. Failure of system networks and consequential loss of business is attempted to be minimised by critical systems being operated on secured servers with regular maintenance, regular back up and off–site storage of data, selection of suitable firewall and virus protection systems / software. 16.7 Other Risks Various assets of the Company including plant and machinery, stocks, buildings, furniture, office equipment and computer systems could suffer damages / loss owing to occurrences like fire, accidental mishaps, etc. The Company has taken insurance covers to protect these assets from possible damage / loss. While the Company undertakes regular review of remuneration structures, threat of poaching by competitors, especially, new entrants in the industry of key persons is possible. Such actions could lead to temporary drop in efficiency and performance in the specific areas. 17. DIRECTORS During the year, Mr.Sanjay G Hinduja ceased to be Director of the Company.
