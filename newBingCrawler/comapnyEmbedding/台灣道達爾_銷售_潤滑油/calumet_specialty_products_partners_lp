Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. is a public U.S.-based company, incorporated in 1916, which specializes in the manufacturing of naphthenic and paraffinic oils as well as aliphatic solvents and paraffin waxes. They own several manufacturing plants in Princeton, Cotton Valley, and Shreveport, Louisiana, as well as in Burnham, Illinois, Dickinson, TX, Karns City, Pennsylvania, and Superior, WI.
Facilities[edit]
In 2001, Calumet acquired the Shreveport facility from Pennzoil-Quaker State and it is one of the only complete specialty refineries operating in the United States. The Shreveport refinery is the largest operating facility in northwest Louisiana.
On October 1, 2010 Calumet acquired the Superior, WI refinery from Murphy Oil USA. This Superior Refinery primarily produces fuels along with Asphalt and Bunker Fuel to the Great Lakes shipping industry allowing Calumet to diversify their product offerings. The Shreveport Refinery is considered the flagship refinery of Calumet.
