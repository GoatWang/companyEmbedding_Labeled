In this report, PMR offers a seven-year forecast of the global white spirits market between 2016 and 2022. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.2% during the projected period in terms of value. The study demonstrates the market dynamics and trends in all the five regions, which are expected to influence the current nature and future status of the global white spirits market over the forecast period.
This Persistence Market Research report examines the global white spirits market for the period 2016-2022. The primary objective of the report is to offer updates on the advancements in the manufacturing process of white spirits, which is giving rise to the production of Low Aromatic White Spirits (LAWS), which helps in significantly reducing the VOC content and eliminating the kerosene-like smell.
White spirits are basically oil-derived complex substances consisting of aliphatic-, alicyclic-, and aromatic-hydrocarbons with carbon numbers mainly in the range of C7 to C12. These are clear, colorless, and flammable liquids with a flash point of approximately 21- 68°C.
White spirits have the density of approximately 0.8 g/ml, slight water solubility, and vapor pressure in the range of 0.3 - 3.0 kPa. They have a distinct odor with an odor threshold of 0.5 - 5.0 mg/m3 in air, due to their high content of aromatic hydrocarbons in certain types of white spirits.
In the next section, PMR covers the white spirits market performance in terms of the global white spirits revenue split, since this is detrimental to the growth of the global white spirits market. This section additionally includes PMR’s analyses of the key trends, drivers, and restraints from the supply, demand, and economy side, which are anticipated to influence growth of the global white spirits market currently and in the future. Impact analysis of the key growth drivers and restraints, based on the weighted average model is included in the global white spirits market report to better equip and arms clients with crystal clear decision-making insights.
As highlighted earlier, white spirits are an aggregation of various types including type 1, type 2, type, 3, and type 0 white spirit, which are classified on the basis of carbon number and boiling range. All these segments and sub-segments are included in this section to make the study more comprehensive.
The next section of the report highlights white spirits adoption by grade, application, and region. It provides a market outlook for 2016–2022 and sets the forecast within the context of the global white spirits market ecosystem. This study discusses the key regional trends contributing to the growth of the white spirits market on a worldwide basis, as well as analyses the degree at which global drivers are influencing this market in each region. Key regions assessed in this report include North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East and Africa.
All the above sections, by product type, grade, application or regions, evaluate the present scenario and the growth prospects of the white spirits market for the period 2016 –2022. We have considered 2015 as the base year and provide data for the trailing 12 months. 
To calculate the white spirits market size, we have considered revenue generated from the sale of white spirits and adoption of services. The forecast presented here assesses the total revenue by value across the white spirits market. In order to offer an accurate forecast, we started by sizing the current market, which forms the basis of how the white spirits market will develop in the future. Given the characteristics of the market, we triangulated the outcome of three different types of analyses, based on the supply side, consumer spending, and economic envelope. However, forecasting the market in terms of various white spirits market segments and regions is more a matter of quantifying expectations and identifying opportunities rather than rationalising them after the forecast has been completed.
In addition, it is imperative to note that in an ever-fluctuating global economy, we not only conduct forecasts in terms of CAGR but also analyse on the basis of key parameters such as Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y) growth to understand the predictability of the market and to identify the right opportunities across the white spirits market.
As previously highlighted, the global white spirits market is split into a number of sub-segments. All the global white spirits market segments in terms of product type, grade, application and region are analysed on the basis of their Basis Point Share (BPS) to understand individual segments’ relative contribution to the market growth. This detailed level of information is important for the identification of various key trends in the global white spirits market.    
Another key feature of this report is the analysis of all key white spirits market segments and sub-segments, the adoption of white spirits globally, and the revenue forecast of the market in terms of absolute dollar opportunity. This is traditionally overlooked while forecasting the market. However, absolute dollar opportunity is critical in assessing the level of opportunity that a manufacturer can look to achieve, as well as to identify potential resources from a sales and delivery perspective in the global white spirits market. 
Furthermore, to understand key growth segments in terms of growth and adoption of white spirits market across regions, Persistence Market Research developed the global white spirits market attractiveness index. The resulting index should help providers identify the real market opportunities.
In the final section of the report, the global white spirits market competitive landscape is included to provide report audiences with a dashboard view, based on categories of suppliers and manufacturers in the value chain, their presence in the white spirits product portfolio, and key differentiators. Key categories of players covered in the report are white spirits manufacturers. This section is primarily designed to provide clients with an objective & detailed comparative assessment of key providers specific to a market segment in the white spirits value chain. Report audiences can gain segment-specific vendor insights to identify and evaluate key competitors based on the in-depth assessment of their capabilities and success in the global white spirits marketplace. Detailed profiles of the providers are also included in the scope of the report to evaluate their long-term and short-term strategies, key offerings and recent developments in the white spirits market space. Key competitors covered in the market are ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell Plc., and Total S.A.

White spirits are oil-derived complex substances consisting of aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic-hydrocarbons with carbon numbers mainly in the range of C7 to C12. These are clear, colorless, and flammable liquids with a flash point of approximately 21- 68°C. White spirits have density of approximately 0.8 g/ml, slight water solubility, and vapor pressure in the range of 0.3 - 3.0 kPa. They have a distinct odor with an odor threshold of 0.5 - 5.0 mg/m3 in air, due to their high content of aromatic hydrocarbons.
White spirits are commonly used as paint thinner and as solvent for extraction, cleaning, and degreasing. White spirits are also used for cleaning and degreasing machine tools and parts, and in conjunction with cutting oil as a thread cutting and reaming lubricant. In households, white spirits are commonly used to clean paint brushes after use, clean auto parts and tools, as a starter fluid for charcoal grills, and to remove adhesive residue from non-porous surfaces, etc. Although not normally marketed as a fuel, white spirits are also used as an alternative to kerosene in portable stoves, since they are a light grade of kerosene.

The global white spirits market is anticipated to expand at a double-digit CAGR during the forecast period. Growth of the global white spirits market is mainly driven by the modest jet kerosene prices, steady demand from the paints and coatings industry, changing demographics, improving global economic conditions, and the increasing demand for these spirits as a turpentine substitute. Other trends driving growth of the global white spirits market include shifting focus towards low aromatic white spirits and customization of product portfolio more specific to an application.
The global white spirits market is segmented, based on product type, into type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 0 white spirit. Out of these segments, type 1 segment has been estimated to account for over 53.1% volume share of the global white spirits market by 2015 end. Meanwhile, the type 3 segment has been estimated to account for a mere 15.1% volume share of the global market by 2015 end. However, it is expected to remain the fastest growing segment during the forecast period, expanding at a volume CAGR of 4.8%

In this report, the global white spirits market is sub-segmented on the basis of grade into low flash grade, regular flash grade, and high flash grade. Out of these grades, the regular flash grade segment has been estimated to dominate the global white spirits market by 2015 end, and is expected to continue its dominance in the market by 2022.
The global white spirits market is segmented on the basis of paint thinner, cleansing solvent, degreasing solvent, fuel, disinfectants, and others. Out of all these applications, the paint thinner segment has been estimated to dominate the global white spirits market by 2015 end. However, cleansing solvent and degreasing solvent segments are also anticipated to expand at a healthy CAGR over the forecast period.   
In this report, the global white spirits market has been sub-segmented into five major regions, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. Of all the regions, Asia Pacific has been estimated to dominate with over 39.6% volume share of the overall white spirits market volume share by 2015 end. Meanwhile, the North America market ranked second with more than 27.6% market volume share in 2015, followed by Europe. In addition, Asia-Pacific is anticipated to become the fastest growing regional market in the global white spirits market over the forecast period.
Some of the key players identified in the global white spirits market include ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total S.A., Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd., CEPSA, Neste Oyj, and others. Major market participants, such as ExxonMobil Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, focus on research and development activities to provide low aromatic content white spirits in order to attain a sustainable advantage over the competition. In addition, these key players also focus on expanding their product portfolio and offerings through acquisition of various small and big white spirit plants with an objective to enhance their customer base.
