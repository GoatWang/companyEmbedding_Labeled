OIL & GAS DISTRIBUTION

Figures for Products are given:- 
			   by EACH COUNTRY / STATE / REGION & CITY. The data is given on a map of each country or state.
OIL & GAS PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION:
The Surveys of Suppliers and Distribution Channels reveal the geographic
    distribution channels for products. In markets where the Distribution Channels are
    radically at variance with the Distribution of the Customer Base, there are obviously
    logistic problems in the supply and servicing of the customers; and this may represent an
    opportunity for companies entering that particular national market to provide a superior
    service and thereby gain market share. It is thus possible to analyse the distribution of
    the Customer Base (being the Market) and the distribution of the existing suppliers in
    order to evaluate whether or not customers are receiving adequate service or product
    distribution.KEY SERVICE CITIES: Within each of the countries covered there are certain Key Service Cities which are
    vital to the distribution and servicing of the Product Market or Industry. The maps give
    these KEY SERVICE CITIES which are ranked according to their relative importance in the
    	base country concerned. Any company in the market or wishing to enter the various national
    markets should consider the establishment of sales and distribution in relation to these
    KEY SERVICE CITIES as they reflect the potential regional market logistics for Products.
