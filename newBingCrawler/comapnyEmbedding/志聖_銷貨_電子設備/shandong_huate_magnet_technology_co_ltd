            Hmds wet magnetic drum separator is widely used in coal mine processing. With the development and expansion of heavy media processing technique, drum separator for heavy media processing is widely used in coal-washing plant. The structure of coal mine used drum separator has never had big change, while with the application of new magnetic material, magnet developed from simplex ferrite, mixed magnet to rare earth super strength magnet. Magnetic intensity was raised greatly, improving the recovery percent and lowering media consuming effectively.
Features:
1. Important role in coal mine recycling
2. High minmal permanent magnet
3.Keep magnetism for long time 
4.Duble stainess steel structure of the pullyer
5.High recycling rate

            Magnetic stirrer

With the unique magnetic circuit and special high performance alnico treated by special technology, it can resist high-temperature with long life. 
Using mechanical drive for stir, lift and movement, it can wok reliably, safely and environmental protection.
Using the alternatively clockwise and anticlockwise, the solution can be stirred effectively with adjustable speed and interval. The depth can achieve more than 100-700mm.
The electric consumption for our permanent magnetic stirrer is less than 5 percent of electromagnetic stirrer under the same tonnage.
Matching with the perfect wind-cooling system, the working temperature can be controlled within 65.
High efficiency, continuous work. It can work for many functions at different time.
Equipped with the advanced remote controlling system, it has a high degree of automation and its operation is simple and convenient.
