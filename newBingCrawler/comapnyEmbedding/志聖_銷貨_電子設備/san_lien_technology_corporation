UPC Technology Corporation
UPC Technology Corporation (UPC) was founded in 1976 as a petrochemical product producer. Over the past 30 years, UPC has been maintaining a steady and rapid growth along with the overall economic development and gradual shift of emerging markets. To this day, UPC has built manufacturing and logistics centers in five locations: Taiwan and Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Zhenjiang and Taizhou in China. With these locations, UPC has become the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of phthalic anhydride (PA) and plasticizers, commanding over 30% of the Chinese market.
In addition to continuously focusing on the core chemicals business, UPC supports the development of specialty chemicals, warehousing, trade, and logistics businesses. This operation model integrating the synergy of the internal resources, including economy of scale, economy of scope and product differentiation, with external alliances is what builds up the core competitiveness of UPC. In the future, UPC will continuously work for sustainable growth, and to fulfill the market and customer demands with professional and comprehensive products and services based on the corporate culture: honesty, prudence and pragmatism.
