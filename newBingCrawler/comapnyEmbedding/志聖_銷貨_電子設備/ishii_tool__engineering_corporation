We are an R&D company dedicated to automated labor-saving equipment, precision molds, and precision machining. We have an integrated production system that covers from equipment and mold design to programming, adjustment, and delivery. This reduces the time required for design and productization. Our internally developed Soft Press has been highly evaluated for its contribution to improving quality and work environments in semiconductor plants. For this we received the Science and Technology Agency’s Director-General’s Award. We have also changed conventional corner-post dies by making the usual cylinder-shaped guide post into a square shape to enhance resistance to pressure and improve machining precision.       製品・技術情報       Various kinds of automated assembly equipment    [Product description] Our Soft Press is an optimal device for cutting, molding, chalking, and press-fitting thin metal sheets. It is driven by a servomotor and controlled by a microcomputer, and its mechanical sections are oil-filled. It has excellent silencing properties, low noise, and low vibration. This press equipment works gently on the product. Each manufacturing process in our building-block system is modularized to easily configure automated and integrated production facilities for multiple production processes. [Authorization/Certification] Obtained ISO 9001 (February 1997) and ISO 14011 (1997). [Intellectual property] Soft Press is already patented in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, US, and Europe.    詳細はこちら         Square guide post molds    [Product description] Guide posts are mechanical parts that connect upper and lower molds. The posts used in ordinary molds are cylinder-shaped, but our molds use square guide posts. These square posts use cylinder-shaped roller bearings rather than the spherical bearings used in round posts. This significantly enhances the rigidity of the post and stabilizes the machining accuracy. The resulting pressing becomes more resistant to unbalanced loads within the mold, and more stable. In addition, the blade is stabilized without swaying. This prevents the cutting tool from wearing off, which prolongs its service life. [Authorization/Certification] Obtained ISO 9001 (February 1997) and ISO 14011 (1997).

We have an integrated production system for equipment and molds covering design, machining, assembly, wiring, programming, adjustments, and delivery.We also design and assemble control microcomputer boards for automatic machines in-house. For this we have 50 3D CAD units, various kinds of precision machining equipment (precision grinders, machining centers, sheet metal laser beam machines), and many resin molding presses.We can complete planning, design, prototype manufacturing, evaluation, and productization phases in a short period of time. [Business description]Our company deals with machining mold dies. We are mainly involved in T/F processing (lead processing) in the post-process assembly phase for semiconductors, and related pressing, marking, and inspection/sorting equipment.We recently expanded our sales channels to enter the automobile industry (assembling equipment for in-vehicle electronic parts) by making use of our track record in the field of semiconductor assembly.Our business also covers other fields, such as solar power generation equipment, real estate, and home use elevators. [Industry]Manufacturing[Strength of products/technologies]Soft Press: Conventional presses are hydraulically operated so they need to be large and massive. They also produce a great deal of noise and vibration, while constantly consuming electricity for operating the hydraulic pump. Soft Press is a quiet, clean press facility driven by a servomotor, which makes it small and lightweight without producing much noise or vibration. Its contribution to enhancing product quality and the work environment in semiconductor plants has been highly recognized. For this we received the Science and Technology Agency’s Director-General’s Award.Corner post molds: Connecting guide posts between the upper and lower sides of a mold are usually cylinder-shaped. We made these into square poles to enhance their resistance to pressure and to enhance machining precision. This prolongs the service life of the cutting tool, which reduces the mold maintenance cost. [Representative's message]Our company started as a mold manufacturer, but we are now group of experts that can develop and manufacture many things in-house. This includes running gears for molds, microcomputer electric devices, and servo presses, in addition to other component technologies for automatic machines.Our sales department has been specialized in the semiconductor industry. We will now modify the development and manufacturing departments to quickly capture and cultivate emerging needs to swiftly adapt to the changing times. [Company structure for market development/overseas expansion]Our company has had dealings with major domestic household electrical appliance manufacturers and auto parts makers, and these are still continuing.Our stocks are listed, so we have an internal control system in place to conduct audits. Our workflow is well established from the start of transactions to the delivery phase.We have proficient English speakers in the headquarters office in Oita to conduct overseas sales activities, and we have no difficulty with our export business, etc. [Awards and media coverage][Awards]Science and Technology Agency Director-General’s Award; SME Frontier Award; New Business Award; Denso Excellent Supplier Technology Development Award; and so on.[Media][Authorization/Certification]Obtained ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification.[Joint research and development]Realization of linear actuator acceleration and high output (Oita University, intensive R&D program by Oita Prefecture, 2008 to 2012), and so on.[Factory (domestic)]Oita[Main Clients / Business History (domestic)]Semiconductor and liquid crystal makers: Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Panasonic, NEC, J-Devices, Renesas, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, and so on.In-vehicle parts makers: Denso, Toyota, Aisin, and so on.[Main Clients / Business History (overseas)]Semiconductor makers: Samsung, Hyundai (Korea), ASE, PTI (Taiwan), On Semiconductor (Singapore), TI, Motorola (US), and so on. [Exhibition History/Information]SEMICON Japan; INTERNEPCON JAPAN; and so on.SEMICON WEST, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Europe; SEMICON China 2014 (planned).   日本語ページ掲載情報  https://jgoodtech.jp/ja_JP/web/jc0000000004418/jpn                  類似する企業はこちら  類似する企業はありませんでした。
