Product Features


Dermacell is decellularized using Matracell, a proprietary and patented technology that removes at least 97% of donor DNA without compromising the desired biomechanical structure or biochemical properties for its intended use.
After being rendered acellular, Dermacell undergoes a terminal sterilization step to ensure a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of 10-6.
Low-dose gamma irradiation performed at ultra-low temperatures is used to reach surgical device-grade sterility, which lowers the probability of an active organism in the graft to 1 in 1,000,000 – lower than 10-3 or, a 1 in a 1,000 chance.
