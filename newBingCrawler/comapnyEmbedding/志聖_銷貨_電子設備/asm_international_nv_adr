   News  Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), ASM International NV (ADR) (ASMI): These Semiconductor Equipment Companies Deserve Your Attention    Published on August 5, 2013 at 9:06 am by  
                                The Motley Fool
                                  in News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           In the highly cyclical semiconductor business, only a few companies possess the necessary strength to survive and succeed through the constant ups and downs. Although many analysts would support the idea of investing in sector behemoths like Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), in other words, playing safe, I would advocate on taking a closer look at some smaller, less-known companies like ASM International NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASMI) and KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), which hold strong competitive advantages, mainly due to their cutting-edge and specific product offerings, and thus, stand as highly compelling investment opportunities.  The jewel of the Crown ASM International NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASMI) is a leading provider of manufacturing process and technology solutions for semiconductor producers, carrying out front-and-back-end activities. After selling out a 12% stake of its back-end activities and distributing the gains among shareholders, while implementing a restructuring of its front-end segment, the company looks like a more appealing, even undervalued, investment. Although it reported strong second-quarter results, a weak guidance for its third-quarter revenue led its stock price to plummet by over 15%, opening an attractive entry point for investors. Strong competition from Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is expected to continue, but considerable spending on R&D should provide the firm with a competitive advantage over the next few years. As a result, analysts anticipate that ASM International NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASMI) will outperform the sector’s EPS performance in the long run, mainly on the back of its cutting-edge front-end tools business. Moreover, the progressive migration of its front-end manufacturing activities to (the lower-cost market of) Singapore should help ASM International NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASMI) improve its margins and returns. In addition, its back-end segment, with low-cost operations in Asia, looks like a hidden gem, for it remains consistently profitable, returning industry leading results. Trading at a third of the industry average in relation to its sales and about half the mean in relation to its consensus earnings, this stock looks quite undervalued. Moreover, a 1.7% dividend yield makes the wait worthwhile. I´d say buy and hold, you will probably not regret it. Goliath is not so agile Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a leading provider of manufacturing equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor industry, among others (including the solar photovoltaic and flat panel display industries). With almost ten times the market capitalization of ASM International NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASMI), the competition it poses is considerably strong. Its scale, broad product offering, and strong brand name provide it with a wide economic moat, allowing it to successfully compete in almost every segment of the industry. Moreover, hefty R&D investments keep the firm ahead of its competition, while continuous cost-control initiatives and increasing synergies make its prices more appealing. However, I consider that Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is not an investment as attractive as ASM International NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASMI), even though analysts expect it to outperform the broader sector in terms of EPS growth in the long run. For starters, the width of its product offering can be seen as a pro, but also as a con. Since many of its competitors specialize in particular products, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) runs disadvantaged in many of its end-markets, while smaller firms offer the best products in these particular niches. Furthermore, the cyclicality of the semiconductor business, a high fixed-cost structure, and the recent weakness in its solar equipment segment could strongly impact its future results. Finally, its valuation at 25 times consensus earnings and a PEG ratio of 2.8, both about double the industry averages, lead me to advocate on holding on this stock for now. A closer inspection KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is another interesting investment option in the semiconductor equipment business. With a market cap of almost $10 billion, it stands in between ASM and Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT). However, holding a leading spot in the process diagnostic and control (PDC) market, the company offers margins and returns which are among the best in the industry.

	Veeco Instruments Inc.
	
		(2016
	sales of $332.45 million
		of which 41%
		was Lighting, Display & Power Electronics),

	Manitex International Inc
	
		($288.96 million

	Sales Analysis. 
	ASM International NV reported sales of $659.95 million
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.

			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 10.6%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were $738.56 million.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 10.6% decline
		in Front-End, from $738.56 million to $659.95 million.
		.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Back-End (up 10.8% to $1.84 billion)

 NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- ASM International NV ADR (Nasdaq: ASMI) has been upgraded by TheStreet Ratings from hold to buy. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, reasonable valuation levels, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.   ACTIVE STOCK TRADERS: Check out TheStreet's special offer for Real Money, headlined by Jim Cramer, now!   Highlights from the ratings report include:   Compared to its closing price of one year ago, ASMI's share price has jumped by 27.33%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, ASMI should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.   38.30% is the gross profit margin for ASM INTERNATIONAL NV which we consider to be strong. Regardless of ASMI's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, ASMI's net profit margin of 4.80% is significantly lower than the same period one year prior.   The revenue fell significantly faster than the industry average of 13.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues fell by 34.9%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share.   Despite currently having a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.34, it is higher than that of the industry average, inferring that management of debt levels may need to be evaluated further. Regardless of the somewhat mixed results with the debt-to-equity ratio, the company's quick ratio of 1.32 is sturdy.    ASM International N.V., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research, development, manufacture, marketing, and servicing of equipment and materials that are primarily used to produce semiconductor devices. The company operates in two segments, Front-end and Back-end. The company has a P/E ratio of 12.1, above the average electronics industry P/E ratio of 11.2 and below the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 17.7. ASM International NV ADR has a market cap of $2.12 billion and is part of the technology sector and electronics industry. Shares are up 34% year to date as of the close of trading on Monday.  You can view the full ASM International NV ADR Ratings Report or get investment ideas from our investment research center.   -- Written by a member of TheStreet Ratings Staff   TheStreet ratings do not represent the views of TheStreet's staff or its contributors. Ratings are established by computer based on metrics for performance (which includes growth, stock performance, efficiency and valuation) and risk (volatility and solvency). Companies with poor cash flow or high debt levels tend to earn lower ratings in our model.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com UK's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.
