Design to Moulding
Why Tex Plastics has the edge in component development and how it can add real value to your product range
Design-rationalisation, assessment and a 360° review at the start of all new component production pays massive dividends. It results in a more robust and ‘fit for purpose’ component with minimal waste, which is manufactured in the most efficient way.
This is a fundamental element of our management process
It is key to minimising lead-times and reducing all elements of risk before going into full production.
Once our in-house design team have completely understood the key requirements of the component, they undertake detailed perfomance and Moldflow® analysis. This accurately predicts how any given material will behave in the application concerned – an essential part of the material selection tool design process.
Design & Prototyping Services
• Concept design
• Re-engineering of existing designs
• Prototyping
• Mouldflow projections
• Material selection and specification
• SLA and SLS Models
• Vacuum Castings
 
The process is project managed by a technical solutions manager
The appointed technical solutions manager will have specific experience in your sector. This minimises the communication chain and guarantees that critical paths are strictly adhered to, consistency is achieved and budgets are not exceeded.
Comprehensive facilities at both Barnstaple and Derby sites
This enables us to carry out either total manufacture, minor modification or refurbishment of mould tools - virtually eliminating the use of costly subcontractors.
This tooling expertise uniquely places us to select the best tool making partners for your requirements. 
Cost, lead-times and quality needs allow us to source the preferred partner from our Global relationships with Tooling manufacturers, enabling you to acquire the best possible solution to bring your product to the market on time with the least risk.
Design and Prototyping Management Process:

Commitment to meet or exceed customer expectations through a 360° review of product and supply chain
Streamlined communication through a dedicated ‘sector focused’ technical solutions manager
A realistic development schedule and tooling manufacturer selected, based upon client and component criteria
Sampling and development completed to full approval by the toolmaker and managed by Tex Plastics
Pre-production completed at Tex Plastics using the local technical skills employed for full product approval

About
BSP International Foundations Ltd is one of the world’s premier manufacturers of hydraulic hammer and compaction equipment. Its products and sales agents are found in most developed countries or regions, where modern construction methods are an essential element in meeting infrastructure targets. 

Yet when The British Steel Piling Company Ltd, as it was originally called, was founded by Edward le Bas in 1905, its immediate objective was not the manufacture of equipment, but to promote the use in Britain of steel sheet piling. The driving and extraction of the piling was obviously an important part of this, with the result that the company was soon called upon to provide equipment for others to carry out such work. By 1914, the earliest versions of BSP steam/air piling hammers had appeared, as had equipment for extracting piles.

The company’s influence continued to grow before, during and after the Second World War, in terms of both piling and piling machinery and equipment. For a number of years, it was also involved in the manufacture of drilling, earth boring and tunnelling machines.

BSP was transformed into a full-time foundation equipment manufacturer during the early 1970s, when the newly nationalised British Steel Corporation took over the marketing of all UK produced steel sheet piling. The company was acquired by Tex Holdings plc in 1989 and is still based at Great Blakenham, near the Suffolk town of Ipswich, where it first established a manufacturing centre in 1921.

Always at the forefront of significant foundation equipment developments, BSP initiated the worldwide move towards hydraulic hammers and set the standard for their design and construction. Today, over 80 per cent of the company’s products are exported and it is represented in 67 countries.

It has always been BSP’s policy to make every effort to ensure that every product is suited to the application for which it has been specified. Customers have the reassurance of knowing that their investment in BSP foundation equipment has been designed and manufactured to meet all of the following criteria:

Value for money 
Versatility 
Controllability 
Efficiency 
Environmental acceptability 
Reliability 
Quality Assure registered manufacturer 
First class after sales services and support

Highlights

Revenue of $748 million, up 4% on a like-for-like basis and down 3% reported; continued double digit sales growth (13%) in Speciality business
Operating profit up 9% on a like-for-like basis before exceptional items; with 15% growth in Industrial segmental profit
Adjusted EPS up 20% to 1.82 cents; reported EPS negatively impacted by non-operating items
Adjusted free cash flow for the last twelve months of $50 million
Completed sale of EMEA Crafts business in July 2015

Commenting on Coats half year 2015 results Paul Forman, Group Chief Executive, said:
‘Coats performed well in the first half of 2015, delivering a 9% increase in operating profit. The Speciality business continued to deliver double digit sales growth, with product innovation playing a key role, and we achieved further market share gains in the core Apparel and Footwear business. Both factors contributed to 15% growth in Industrial profit. Performance in our ongoing Crafts business was impacted by reduced fashion handknitting sales, although there was encouraging growth in some product ranges and notably greater predictability of performance.
‘Non-operating items, primarily foreign exchange losses on parent group cash and discontinued losses related to EMEA Crafts, had a negative impact on reported earnings; however on an adjusted basis we continued to deliver good growth. Consistent delivery of good levels of free cash flow provide a solid platform for ongoing investment in organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Supported by our defined growth strategy, key differentiators and strong underlying business performance, Coats is well positioned for 2015 and beyond.’

Tex Holdings PLC

AGM Statement

RNS Number : 1878J Tex Holdings PLC 26 June 2017  

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT - 26 JUNE 2017
 
I expect you have had time to read our annual accounts and I will be happy to address any questions you may have in due course.
 
I will now give you a short report of the trading companies.
 
The Plastics Division overall is trading in line with expectations.  At Barnstaple, the factory faces subdued orders.  A price increase with a major customer has been forced through, which may result in this work ultimately being lost. 
 
Trading at the Derby site has however been better than budgeted which will help maintain the overall divisional performance.
 
The Plastics Division does though face pressure on costs such as that of raw materials and the impact of the National Minimum Wage which is putting general pressure on wages overall.
 
Within the Engineering Division, Tex Engineering has opened the year strongly on the back of increased demand for a number of its product lines.   With margin and overheads under control we should see the company report another solid profit this year.
 
Eurotex have received the long awaited order from Chile which will free up stock, reduce our stock reserves and move our company into profit.  Further rationalisation of this company is being investigated.
 
The ATC team has been expanded and 2017 is expected to be a year of transition. The aircraft carrier project is continuing to provide work, moreover there are a number of further opportunities both within the civilian and military market worldwide.  The growth in air travel, the doubling in air passenger numbers is driving the need for additional airport capacity and within that, the demand for control towers.
 
BSP has opened the year slowly.   Enquiry levels remain buoyant including enquiries from the Baltic states and South America for the airfield damage repair system. 
 


 
G&M TEX achieved a profit in its first full year of trading, after allowing for the costs of relocation to Claydon. The current year will see the completion of the move into a new purpose-built factory, which will allow us to develop larger generator units in conjunction with a major engine manufacturer.
 
QK Honeycomb Products suffered from its prices being affected by exchange rate fluctuations in 2016.  Assuming that exchange rates remain at current levels the effect of this will not be repeated in the current year.  On a positive note, the leisure vehicle market which provides the underlying volume of QK business is returning to pre-recession levels.
 
We live in difficult times which makes forecasting and planning for the Group somewhat testing.  However, the Board is confident that any upturn will be to our advantage.
 
As a Board, we prioritise the care and support of our pensioners. I am pleased to report the pension fund deficit has stabilised, due in part to the high level of the stock market. We continually monitor the most effective way of handling the large liabilities that our Pension Fund presents.  
 
We will continue to protect the interests of both our pensioners and those who have given many years of good service to the Group, we as your directors will continue to act in the best interest of our shareholders in both good and difficult times.
