Grinder / Polisher

 















Grinder/polishers can complete every step of the process from wafer backgrinding to dry polishing on the same chuck table for high stability processing to very thin finish thicknesses. Support for applications which use the DBG system or DAF (die attach film) is also possible by incorporating a  wafer mounter with the grinder/polisher into an inline system.

Polishers utilize a dry polishing process to remove stresses on the wafer backside introduced by grinding. The dry polishing process is complete water and chemical free and minimizes the burden on the environment.
