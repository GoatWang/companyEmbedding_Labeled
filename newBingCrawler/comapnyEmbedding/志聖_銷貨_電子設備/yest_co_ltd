Group Companies & Representative Office
At Oriental Yeast we refer to group companies as "affiliated companies," and we were early to realign the group and make our locations more efficient in order to enhance the added value and improve our performance as a single corporate entity.
We currently have 11 affiliate companies inside and outside of Japan working
as a group with unified business objectives and purpose.
Overseas we have two locally incorporated units, OYC Americas, Inc. (USA)
and OYC EU B.V. (Netherlands), as well as joint ventures with the Nisshin
Seifun Group in India and China, Oriental Yeast India Pvt. Ltd. and Nisshin
Seifun OYC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., respectively. We have also established
an office in Singapore for the purpose of conducting market research in
Southeast Asia. Our business development on a global scale has also revolved
around numerous foreign companies with whom we have established contractual
or business relationships. We also use the worldwide information obtained
through this network as feedback for our operations within Japan, helping
us to enhance our products and improve our services for the Japanese market.
We are currently strengthening our efforts in the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), Southeast Asia, and South America with the aim of expanding our business in those regions.

Enjoying Bread as Art
Practicing baking as Science through ingredients
Oriental Yeast Company (OYC) was the first company in Japan to successfully mass produce yeast for bread, and over these years we have significantly contributed in making bread a popular and a high quality food item in Japan.  OYC is dedicated to providing the highest quality ingredients to the food and bakery industry and thus invest significant resources to continually develop its ingredient related technologies.  OYC today supplies food ingredients listed below to a broad range of customers such as bakeries, confectionery makers and food companies.
As an industry leader, we are dedicated to becoming a part of our customersâ€™ product development team. As a result we continually travel around the world to understand diverse food and bread cultures enabling us to combine such knowledge with our technical capabilities to conceive novel bread concepts for our customers.
Main products

Bakers' yeast
OYC offers more than 10 different bakersâ€™ yeast strains to meet various baking requirements from low to high sugar bread and from traditional sponge dough to frozen dough methods.  As OYC only manufacturers fresh yeast it is not transportable to overseas markets and these products are currently available for the Japanese market only.






Dough Improver
Most of OYCâ€™s dough improvers are customized for each customerâ€™s requirements.  Since a baking process has many variables OYC believes in adapting the dough conditioner to a particular baking process, environment and the bread attributes sought out rather than using a standard recipe regardless of the baking conditions, process and the bread attributes. Customization of dough improvers allows for cost saving in the long-run by using the optimum amount of ingredients while gaining the maximum quality improvement allowed by the ingredients, baking process and conditions.
OYC has over 200 dough conditioners that could be modified to suit various requirements of our customers.  Recognizing that there are some types of bread that undergo a standard process OYC offers several standard dough improvers for white toast breads.






Bakery filling (flour paste)
OYC bakery filling comes in both paste and sheet form to suit both artisanal bread and high volume bread production equipment.  Available flavors include chocolate, custard, coffee, caramel, maple, green tea, various fruits, etc.






Kansui powder
Japanese Ramen noodle or sometimes known as Chinese noodle in Japan requires noodle improver called Kansui.  Noodles without Kansui tend to be too soft after cooking lowering the quality of the noodle.  In order to keep the noodle firm (or al dente as known in the pasta industry) after cooking and better taste Kansui is added as a noodle improver in the dough. OYC has been offering Kansui in Japan for many years and recently started to export it to China and South East Asia.
