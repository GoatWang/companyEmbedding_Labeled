S Shaped Hollow Sheet - Single Color (Polycarbonate Sheet)



 (Polycarbonate Sheet)



 (Polycarbonate Sheet)

Jeng Chen Industrial Corp has developed an innovation product. It is S Shape Hollow Sheet. We modified the traditional hollow sheet as our new product because of the weakness of traditional hollow sheet. The rib of traditional hollow sheets is line and it can't spread strength all over the whole sheet. And our new product has S-shaped rib to spread strength out. It is greatly impact resistant. In addition, S Shape Hollow Sheet can refract sunlight to gentle sunlight.
Feature

Impact Strength: The impact strength of solid PC sheet is 200 times that of glass, and the impact strength of hollow PC sheet is 80 times that of glass.
Light Weight:The weight of solid PC sheet is only about half of glass, and the weight of hollow PC sheet is only about 1/12 at the same thickness.
Transparentcy:The light transmission of 3mm solid PC sheet is 90%, and the light transmission of 6mm hollow PC sheet is 80%.
UV-protection:PC sheet is co-extruded with a high-density ultra violet ray absorbent to fight against ultra violet ray, it can prevent discoloring and frailness
Weather Resistance:PC sheet have good weather ability, it can maintain excellent properties in a wide temperature range from -40 Degree C to +120 Degree C.
Sound Insulation:The polycarbonate resin offer significant advantage to the sound insulation and it can be used in soundproof
