[Product Description]

PECVD ACL equipment is essential for the front end process of semiconductor manufacturing. It deposits an Amorphous Carbon Layer(ACL) on the surface of a wafer by generating the plasma in a vacuum chamber.

TES is the first and only local equipment manufacturer that successfully adopted PECVD ACL equipment for mass production among of local device companies.

With the increasing concentration and micronization of semiconductor devices, the application and frequency of using PECVD ACL equipment is rising.

Also, since TES PECVD ACL equipment has excellent price and quality competitiveness against foreign major companies, market share is expected to rise continually.


[Product Features]


Wafer Size : 12 inch (300mm)
Process Application 
- PE-SiH4, ACL (Amorphous Carbon Layer)
- SiN, SiON (HM , IMO1/2, Arc, Pass2 Dep.)
Excellent mechanical throughput 
- EFEM : 400WFS ≥ 
- Vacuum robot : 400WFS ≥ 
- W/AL : 230WFS ≥
Outstanding Productivity

Company Description                    




                        Sales dropped YoY, due to the base effect, according to rapid increase in semiconductor investment in 2010.Net profit ratio fell YoY, because of rise in miscellaneous expenses including bad debts expense, along with expansion of cost and selling and administrative expenses burden, arising from sales decline.Amid ease in financial burden, because of repayment of short-term borrowings and settlement of some trade payables, the firm maintains good financial structure with expansion of equity capital thru reserve of retained earnings. Sales expansion is expected with replacement demand of semiconductor equipment, along with product diversification, such as Dry Etcher, PE CVD for solar cells and sealing equipment for OLED.Although, raw material purchase burden is forecast to ease slightly, because of weak U.S.dollar, firms profitability improvement is likely limited, due to other various expenses increase, deriving from inflation.The firm diversifies biz portfolio diversification, in view of biz structure change from equipment modification biz into front-end process of semiconductor and solar cell equipment.
