Shinkawa Ltd. to Release Package Bonder for Multiple Processes
May 12 17
Shinkawa Ltd. has developed the FPB-1ws NeoForce for wafer and substrate as the second step in the multi-process package bonder FPB series, and started accepting new orders. The FPB series is a bonder that has significantly enhanced productivity (2.4 times/machine compared with other company's models), which was a challenge for thermal compression bonding processes for high-end devices. The FPB series also handles several kinds of processes such as C2, C4, and FO-WLP. Last year, the company's released the FPB-1s NeoForce as the first step in the series, which specialized in chip-to-substrate processes. In recent years, 3 and 2.5 dimensional bonding applications using chip-to-wafer processes have been initiated in cutting-edge memory and logic device production, and the demand for wafer handling capability of advanced bonding equipment has been rising rapidly. By selecting either the C2W or C2S process according to changes in the bonding market, the FPB-1ws NeoForce maintains high productivity and contributes to the expansion of customers' business. At the same time, the FPB-1w NeoForce specialized in the C2W process will be added to the lineup of the FPB series, and will respond flexibly to the diversification of processes along with the arrival of the IoT age. Features of FPB-1ws NeoForce Multi-processing package bonder capable of handling Chip-to-Wafer and substrates, Capable of handling high-force and high-accuracy bonding with the company's unique non vibration system and Force Free Gantry, High-productivity and space-saving footprint by adopting multiple heads, Multi-die handling capability: Capable of handling various dies up to 4 product types with automatic selection of product-type parts Productivity/Footprint: Increased approx. 3 times (Compared with other company's models), Other Product Line-ups Wire Bonders, Die Bonders, Flip Chip Bonders.
