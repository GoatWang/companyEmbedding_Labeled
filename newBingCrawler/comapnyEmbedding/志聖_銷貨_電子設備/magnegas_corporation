Co-Combustion










Magnegas Corporation
Tampa-based MagneGas Corporation (NASDAQ: MNGA) is a technology Company that counts among its inventions, a patented process that converts liquid waste into hydrogen based fuels.
The Company currently sells MagneGas® into the metal working market as a faster, safer, and hotter replacement to acetylene. In addition, the Company is developing a variety of ancillary uses for MagneGas® fuels by utilizing its high flame temperature for co-combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and other advanced applications.
It is also selling equipment for the sterilization of bio-contaminated liquid waste (such as pig manure or leachates) for various industrial and agricultural markets.













We tried the new version of MagneGas in May. I noticed a much faster preheat and cutting speed. I am looking forward to using this cutting fuel when it is released.
Dick Clark, Hoekstra Truck Equipment















The new MagneGas has increased our cutting speed by 40%, provides a much cleaner cut, far less smoke than propylene. Also it has reduced our oxygen by 35%.
Kurt Peterseon, Elenbaas Steel Supply















We have been using MagneGas 2® at our off-site maintenance facility for 2 months. I feel that it is a superior product to any other oxy/fuel combination on the market. It cuts even the thickest metals, faster and cleaner than anything I have seen.
Douglas Foster, Maintenance Supervisor of Major Utility in Florida















It’s rare to see a clean burning technology that is actually faster. MagneGas has accomplished this with MagneGas 2®.
Brian Linton, CEO of The Recycling Center of Florida
