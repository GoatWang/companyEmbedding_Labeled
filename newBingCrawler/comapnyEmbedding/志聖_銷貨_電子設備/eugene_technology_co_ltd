Aixtron to sell ALD/CVD memory product line to US subsidiary of South Korea’s Eugene Technology
Deposition equipment maker  Aixtron SE of Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany is to sell the atomic layer  deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) memory product line - based  at its US subsidiary Aixtron Inc in Sunnyvale, CA, USA - to Eugene Technology  Inc, a US subsidiary of South Korea-based Eugene Technology Co Ltd that makes single-wafer  ALD, CVD and plasma deposition and surface treatment systems. 
Aixtron  Inc will continue to provide sales and support for its continued businesses,  and to pursue its thin-film encapsulation (TFE) activities. 
The  agreed purchase price of $45-55m will be paid in cash at closing. The purchase  price includes inventory and other pre-paid assets. Due to ongoing business,  their value will be determined at the time of closing. 
The  transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, including the Committee of  Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), and is expected to close in  second-half 2017. 
Aixtron  expects that the transaction will not affect its full-year 2017 guidance for both  order intake and revenue of €180-210m (including core  business and ALD/CVD business up to the date of sale).
