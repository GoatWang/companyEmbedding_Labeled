Veeco 正式推出 EPIK 700 MOCVD 系統以加速固態照明的普及
2014 年 09 月 04 日
Platform Combines Best-in-Class Yields and Highest Productivity to Lower LED Manufacturing Costs
Click here to view the EPIK 700 Product Presentation  PLAINVIEW, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Veeco Instruments Inc.(Nasdaq:VECO) introduced today the new TurboDisc® EPIK 700™ Gallium Nitride (GaN) Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) system that combines the industry’s highest productivity and best-in-class yields with low cost of operation, further enabling lower manufacturing costs for light emitting diodes (LEDs) for general lighting applications.

Based on Veeco’s proven TurboDisc technology, the EPIK 700 MOCVD system enables customers to achieve a cost per wafer savings of up to 20 percent compared to previous generations through improved wafer uniformity, reduced operating expenses, and increased productivity.The EPIK 700 system features a reactor with more than twice the capacity of current generation reactors.This increased volume, combined with productivity advancements within the reactor, results in a 2.5x throughput advantage over previous generation MOCVD systems.
“The EPIK 700 is our latest in a distinguished line of technologically advanced MOCVD reactors,” said William J. Miller , Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Veeco.“We are pleased to say that one of the world’s top LED manufacturers has thoroughly evaluated and accepted the EPIK 700 due to its production worthiness, stable process and reproducible results.We anticipate that this new product will help our customers further succeed in the solid-state lighting market, by driving down LED manufacturing costs and increasing productivity.”
Since the introduction of the TurboDisc K465i GaN MOCVD System in 2010, Veeco has steadily improved its customers’ cost of ownership and became the world’s leading MOCVD equipment supplier.In 2011, Veeco launched the industry’s first multi-reactor MOCVD system, the award-winning TurboDisc MaxBright® MOCVD System.In addition, Veeco’s MOCVD TurboDisc technology has been recognized as best in the industry by LED trade associations in each year from 2011 to 2013.
“The EPIK 700 is another game-changer for the LED industry,” said Jim Jenson , Senior Vice President and General Manager, Veeco MOCVD.“In addition to higher capacity and throughput, the system contains proprietary technologies within the reactor that improve wavelength uniformity and drive higher yields in a tighter bin.By combining the advanced TurboDisc reactor design with excellent uniformity, higher productivity, proven automation, low consumable costs and improved footprint efficiency, we have significantly improved the cost per wafer for our customers.”
According to a recent IHS Research report, LED unit penetration is expected to reach 15 percent in such key markets as China, Japan, North America and Europe by 2016 and more than double to 40 percent by 2020.
About TurboDisc EPIK 700 GaN MOCVD SYSTEM
Veeco’s new breakthrough EPIK 700 MOCVD system is the LED industry’s highest productivity MOCVD system that reduces cost per wafer by up to 20 percent compared to previous generations.Available in one-and two-reactor configurations, EPIK 700 features breakthrough technologies including the new IsoFlange™ center injection flow and TruHeat™ wafer coil that provide homogeneous laminar flow and uniform temperature profile across the entire wafer carrier.這些技術創新可產生均勻的波長，在更為緊密的生產需求下帶動更高的產量。拜大型反應器之賜，EPIK 700 可提供高出其他系統 2.5 倍的生產量。EPIK 700 專為大量生產所設計，可容納 31x4 英寸、12x6 英寸和 6x8 英寸的晶圓載具。Customers can easily transfer processes from existing TurboDisc systems to the new EPIK 700 MOCVD platform for quick-start production of high quality LEDs.由於 EPIK 700 MOCVD 平台的彈性特點，未來將有更多的升級、更多的附加優勢以及強化功能持續推出，突顯出此世界級系統的與眾不同。

Optical Profilers
Photonics SpectraAug 2010Veeco Instruments Inc.Request Info 
        

Veeco Instruments Inc. has unveiled the ContourGT Surface Metrology
product family, its 10th generation of noncontact, 3-D optical surface profilers.
Based on proprietary white-light interferometry technology, the devices feature
patented higher brightness and dual-LED illumination. They produce fast angstrom-to-millimeter
vertical resolution over large fields of view, with flexible sample setup and good
repeatability to enable precision measurements, even in difficult applications.
Featuring 64-bit multi-core computer operation with the company’s Vision64
operating and analysis software, and an intuitive, modular user interface, the profilers
are designed to increase yield and decrease manufacturing costs. They are suitable
for use in production quality assurance/control and R&D machining and manufacturing
applications within the high-brightness LED, solar, ophthalmic, semiconductor, medical
device and academic research markets.Visit company websitehttp://www.veeco.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=15663
