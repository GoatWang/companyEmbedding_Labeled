Company Description                    




                        In March 1978, Gongin Precision Industrial Co., Ltd. was established by Mr. Su Youxin. It is mainly engaged in manufacture of precision stamping, plastic injection mold and machine parts. In May 1991, it developed the sole SPM650 cans mold in Asia by itself. In July 1994, it became Taiwan's only company who self-developed 3.5-inch floppy disk of non-woven jacket mold, dust cover and drive plate mold. In the same year, it obtained the ISO9002 certification. In February 1995, for the sake of product diversification and enhancement of competitiveness, company executives decided to enter into the IC manufacturing, molds packaging and other high-tech industries. In January 1996, the company selected the aerospace industry, semiconductor and medical equipment, as the entry point to step into the high-tech industry. In July of that year, it got the certification of LRQA mold fixtures and precision parts manufacturing. In September, it gained the MDC (U.S. McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company) mold design and manufacturing certification. In July 1997, the company passed the Aerospace Airlines AIDCS-200 quality system certification. In February 2000, it was recognized as a qualified supplier by Applied Materials, Inc. In June, it obtained, by the U.S. GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE), the discharge machining process (EDM) certification. In October 2000, the company got Chemical Cleaning certification by Applied Materials, Inc., and established design department of aerospace technology project. In May 2001, it passed FPQ of the global giant GE's power systems sector (GEPS), and became a qualified supplier. In February 2002, it signed processing contract of aviation actuator with a world-renowned giant MD. In April 2003, Biochip factory of this company got approval to enter in the Luchu Science Park.
