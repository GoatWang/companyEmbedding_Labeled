Dear Customers and Shareholders,

Since its foundation in 1991, WONIK IPS has been greatly contributed to   Korea's semiconductor equipment industry with its continuous R&D and   customer satisfaction based management.
In our initial business, we domestically produced and provided the Gas   Cabinet, the utility facilities to our customers, then challenged the   domestically produced the all-

      process semiconductor equipments to   successfully develop PE-CVD in 2002. This has been so far the considerable   performance providing for Korea's leading element companies. 
We also branched out to the special gas industry for semiconductor/LCD with successful market entry and then extended sales and growth. In November   2006, we determined the company split on it to Wonik Materials, in order to   concentrate on the semiconductor equipment industry. 
Since its incorporation to Wonik Group at the end of 2005, WONIK IPS is now   transforming itself to Korea's best semiconductor all-process equipment   company, by largely 

      investing on the next generation technology, under the   customer-based and transparency management. Our CVD business is in the middle   of developing the new process and equipment such as ARC, DSIN, PSIN, BPSG, in   addition to the existing P-Teos. When the development is successful and   applied to the customers' mass production, it is expected to greatly   contribute to the extended sales. 
WONIK IPS will make our continuous efforts to get the competitive edges and   improvement in Korea's semiconductor business, by stepping up to the best   level of technology through    more intensified R&D. 
We ask our customers' continued support in the future.
Thank you.
