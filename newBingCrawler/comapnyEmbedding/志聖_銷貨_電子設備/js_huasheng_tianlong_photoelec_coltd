Sydney, Dec 9, 2013 AEST (ABN Newswire) - The China CleanTech Index recorded a 6.5% gain in November 2013 and outperformed all of its four benchmarks.The China CleanTech Index rose from 42.56 to 45.34 over the month of November recording a 6.5% gain. This compared to the static NEX, the CTIUS gain of 2.4%, the Shanghai Composite gain of 3.7% and the MSCI gain of 1.6%.The China CleanTech 20 recorded a slightly stronger gain of 6.6% over the month.The Index performance for the last 12 months now shows a gain of 50.7%, which is a long way ahead of the 12.1% gain recorded by the Shanghai Composite and the 23.8% recorded by the MSCI World.The best performing sub-indices for the month were the China Storage Index with a 10.4% gain and the China Environment Index with a 9.1% gain. The China Solar Index only recorded a 4.9% gain this month but has gained 133% over the last 12 months. The two weakest sub-indices through November were the China Hydro Index which recorded a gain of 1.5% and the China Wind Index recording a gain of 4.6%.The enthusiasm of investors during the month may well have been buoyed by the renewed focus on resolving environmental issues that emerged from the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee.

Sydney, April 8, 2015 AEST (ABN Newswire) - China CleanTech Index January-March 2015 Quarterly Performance ReportThe China CleanTech Index provides the definitive measure of the performance of Chinese cleantech companies that are listed on stock exchanges around the world.The cleantech industry is split into a number of sub-sectors as detailed in the table below. Each of the sub-sectors contains companies that have both environmental and economic benefits.BiogasGeothermal - Hot dry rocks and conventionalBiofuelsLow Emissions Transport TechnologiesCarbon TradingSolar Thermal and PhotovoltaicsEnergy Efficiency & BiomaterialsWaste Management & RecyclingEnergy Storage & Fuel CellsWaterEnvironmental ServicesWave, Tidal & HydroGreen BuildingsWind GenerationThe cleantech sector is fundamentally different to Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance. SRI and ESG look at incremental improvements in company performance and can be seen as 'operational hygiene' measures that find the best in class. Cleantech focuses on companies whose output positively enhances the communities and ecologies in which they reside. It is about doing 'more good' rather than 'less bad'.With over 160 companies falling under the coverage of the Index and with a combined market capitalisation of over 1.9 trillion Renminbi (US$313 billion), the China CleanTech Index presents a picture of the Chinese cleantech industry's growth in a single measure.The Index is weighted by market capitalisation and is benchmarked against the following indices to show its relative performance:- Wilder Hill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX) - which measures the performance of global clean energy stocks- Cleantech Index (CTIUS) - which measures the performance of global cleantech stocks- China Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) - which measures the performance of stocks listed in Shanghai.- MSCI World (MSCI) - which provides a measure of the performance of global stock markets.The rules for the formulation and management of the Index have been developed with reference to global best practice. An overview of these rules is provided in the annual performance report.The China Cleantech Index is updated each month and published on the SinoCleantech website at www.sinocleantech.com and on the Australian CleanTech website at www.auscleantech.com.au. It is published internationally in conjunction with Cleantech Investor (www.cleantechinvestor.com) and in China in conjunction with Top Capital (www.topcapital.cn).Monthly results can be emailed directly to interested parties by subscribing at www.sinocleantech.com.China CleanTech Index PerformanceThe China CleanTech Index outperformed all of its four benchmarks for the month of March 2015 and recorded a huge gain of 16.2%. This was driven by both strong gains across all Chinese stocks and the positive government sentiment towards environmental initiatives expressed at the National People's Congress.The China CleanTech Index rose from 56.1 to 65.2 over the month of March recording a 16.2% gain. This compared to the NEX gain of 2.8%, the CTIUS loss of 1.2%, the Shanghai Composite gain of 13.2% and the MSCI loss of 1.8%. The China CleanTech 20 recorded a 12.3% gain.Over the first quarter of 2015, the China CleanTech Index recorded a gain of 23.7%, outperforming all of its benchmark indices. Over the quarter, the NEX gained 9.1%, the CTIUS gained 4.3%, the Shanghai Composite gained 15.9% and the MSCI gained 1.8%.The twelve month gain for the China CleanTech Index now stands at 46.0% outperforming all but the Shanghai Composite. This twelve month gain is being driven by the China Hydro Index (+112%), the China Environment Index (+55%) and the China Water Index (+54%).
