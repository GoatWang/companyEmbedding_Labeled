Sono-Tek Corporation is the world leader in ultrasonic spray systems for applying precise, thin film coatings. Publicly traded since 1987, Sono-Tekâs founder was the inventor of the ultrasonic nozzle. We create patented high performance ultrasonic spray coating technology used in manufacturing precision electronics, fuel cells, solar cells, medical devices, float and panel glass, nanotechnology coatings and other industrial applications. Since 1975, we have been supplying superior full coating solutions to companies globally.
Our environmentally friendly ultrasonic spray systems provide high performance functional coatings, with dramatic reductions in overspray, savings in raw material, water and energy usage, improved process repeatability and transfer efficiency, high uniformity and reduced emissions.

The 8 Must-Haves for Your Medical Practice WebsiteIf your practice website only tells visitors about your practice, then it's not doing all it should.Websites that convert visitors to patients all use certain elements to ensure  their online success. A mix of SEO tips, good marketing strategy, and tested usability features, here's the eight must-haves for your medical practice website.Download This ResearchFour Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
