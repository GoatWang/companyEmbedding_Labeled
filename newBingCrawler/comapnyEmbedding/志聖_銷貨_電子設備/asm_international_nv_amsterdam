ASM International NV (AMS:ASM) ASM International N.V. Plans Major Restructuring











     ASM International NV (AMS:ASM) Positive Impact on Front-end Gross Margins Approximately 200 jobs will be lost in Almere Almere, the Netherlands, January 9,  2009 --- ASM International  N.V. (NASDAQ: ASMI and  Euronext Amsterdam: ASM)  today announced that  it plans for  a major  restructuring  of ASM  Europe (ASME).  This  plan involves the transfer from Almere, the Netherlands, of the  remaining manufacturing and operational procurement activities for the Vertical Furnace  product  line  to  the  Company's  Front-end   manufacturing operations in Singapore (FEMS) and a reduction of the ASME  workforce in Almere.   The implementation  will  take place  over the  next  12 months.             ASMI expects the proposed  measures will have a  positive impact on the Company's  Front-end gross margins  and will lower  the operating break-even level  for Vertical Furnaces  by at least  30%. Anticipated initial  benefits  in 2009  in  terms of  lower  Vertical Furnace  costs  are  expected  to  be  approximately  €  7  million. Reorganization charges of approximately € 25-30 million are  expected to be  included in  the  Company's accounts,  mainly in  2009.   This includes an estimated € 6 million in non-cash fixed asset  impairment charges.             In making  the announcement, Chuck  del Prado,  President and Chief  Executive Officer  of  ASM International,  said,  "Lowered capacity  utilization  at   our  FEMS  facility   -  the  result   of deteriorating global economic and  industry conditions, today  allows us to execute several steps in  our 'April 2008 Roadmap to  Front-end Profitability' simultaneously  and to  accelerate our  Roadmap.   The measures we  are announcing  today will  lead to  a leaner  and  more focused,  cost-competitive  Front-end  operation,  and  one  that  is capable of generating higher gross margins with a structurally  lower cost-base."             Mr.  del Prado  continued,  "Losing loyal  and  dedicated employees is a painful process.  However, we are committed to  making tough choices  and  firmly executing  on  them in  order  to  deliver improved Front-end profitability."We will make every  effort to ensure that  an equitable social  plan for those leaving the Company will be determined in the framework  of all applicable consultation  procedures with the  ASME works  council and the trade unions."             Five years  ago, ASMI  established FEMS  as its  low-cost manufacturing  hub  for  Front-end  production  in  Singapore.    The transfer of manufacturing was planned in three stages, as detailed in the  Roadmap  to  Front-end  Profitability.   Phase  1  includes  the transfer of  the manufacturing  of generic  parts and  subassemblies, which represent approximately 70% of the cost of goods sold, for  all products.  As of December 2008, ASMI has completed Phase 1 for  three of its core product groups: vertical furnaces, epitaxy and PECVD, and is beginning  the Phase  1 transfer  of its  Transistor Products  ALD components.  The Company is utilizing  the current conditions of  low production volumes to initiate the  next step involving the  transfer of vertical furnace final assembly  and testing, concurrent with  the completion of Phase 1 for the remaining product categories.             The  proposed workforce  reduction affects  approximately 200 employees in  Almere.    The  remaining ASM  Europe workforce  of approximately 350 people  will concentrate on  Vertical Furnace  R&D, Vertical Furnace  Product Management  and  regional Sales  &  Service activities for all  Front-end products.  Mr.  del Prado added,  "ASMI will maintain  a  strong,  highly  skilled  technology  workforce  at Almere, underscoring our commitment to retaining a strong base in the Netherlands."About ASM International ASM International N.V.  and its subsidiaries  design and  manufacture equipment and materials  used to produce  semiconductor devices.

Hopefully this means broad changes which this stale and anemic company needs seriously needs.On other notes, there are good medical and dental benefits, 401k match up to 6%, etc etc.ConsOld middle management seriously, most all need to go. They do not treat their employees very good and there are many many, smart people below them who are very good and eventually tire out on trying to get the improvements done the company seriously needs. Middle management has their little buddy system and they are ineffective, and are truly the anchor to how great this company could be, that it's been damaging ASM's reputation for years now, and it doesn't make it a pleasant place to work. Nearly everyone I know in my department is looking to leave. ASM pretends to be 1 company, but the business units do not communicate or work together. Their block heads and they compete against each other? Does it make sense for ASM Korea to be developing their own same process module as ASM Japan, just because their cultures don't like each other, they won't work together? If I was CEO, I'd put a stop to that garbage instantly !Advice to ManagementThe executive level does not get fed the proper information up to them from the middle managers who are collecting fat paychecks and do very little, that even the executive level doesn't really know what's going on so they can make proper decisions, and it's not their fault. I'm sure Chuck wouldn't want his company run this way, if he really knew what was going on. The company consistently gets feedback from customers that our field service is terrible at fixing the tools, because nobody holds them accountable to strive and continue learning beyond their basic training. ASM's reputation is it doesn't have it together, and I continue to agree with our customers from what I've seen. I've brought many issues to my boss' attention, and EVERY time it dies there. I'm soon to leave also, as well as recently many very good people have already left, these have been the worst managers I've ever worked for in a 35 year working career.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) ASM International NV Response seconds agoEdit • Delete ASM International NV 2016-12-01 06:30 PST Sep 22, 2016"ASM is a global company but seems very disorganized."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendPositive OutlookProsGood Starting pay and benefitsConsDisorganization.
