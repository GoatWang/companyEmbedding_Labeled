Features :

A highly rigid CFRP end effector uses a special shape (patent pending) that reduces the bending of the substrate in order to avoid interference with the cassette. The end effector is also compatible with 0.5mm thick substrates. A substrate misalignment detection sensor is also built in.
Long distance transfer of over 10m at high speed is made possible with the accurate rack-and-pinion robot transfer axis.
The cassette station has a segmented structure at each stage that facilitates compatibility with AGV, MGV. RGV and stockers.
The cassette positioning mechanism is equipped with a floating structure to control particles generated from the bottom of the cassette
Patented end effectots & know-how to manage low particle count with clean robot on a large unit.
