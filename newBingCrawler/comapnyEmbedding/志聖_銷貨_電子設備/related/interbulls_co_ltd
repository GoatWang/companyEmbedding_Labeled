Photonics M&A Activity
Realizing Higher Average Valuations than All Other Sectors

The Mergers & Acquisitions market for photonics  companies and those enabled by photonics remains strong in 2016.   Although total transaction value is down almost 75%, compared to the M&A market as a whole, average valuation multiples  for companies supplying core photonics technologies and components are  higher than all manufacturing sectors.

*Source, Ceres; Source other sectors, McGraw Hill Financial
Middle market companies employing  photonics   to serve a wide breadth  of markets, such as Semiconductor Equipment, Display, Surveillance & Navigation and Materials & Coatings, are  realizing high valuations.
Leading the pack on Implied Enterprise Value/Revenue are early stage companies based in China and Korea. Interbulls Co., provider of back-end semiconductor equipment (56x); Shenzhen Xiaodou Technology Co., supplier of machine vision products (56x); Beijing 7D-VISION Technology Co., manufacturer of studio equipment to produce virtual reality content (55x); Guangzhou Geo Optical Technology Co., provider of global navigation satellite systems (48x); and E-SOL Co., manufacturer of smart solar glass films and windows (44x).
The Transactions
M&A transactions are researched with closing or  announce dates   from  January 1 to December 31, 2016.  Transactions volumes,  values,   geographies,  and market segments are analyzed. Values are in    $US at   historical rates of exchange. Implied Enterprise Value is defined as the total consideration to shareholders (adjusted for % acquired) plus earnouts plus rights/warrants/options plus size adjustment plus net assumed liabilities.

Activity
The LED Packages and Luminaires, Materials and Coatings, Communications, Semiconductor Equipment and Display segments see the most activity in volume of transactions.

Click graphic for inputs
In 2016, the total and average   Enterprise Value    of the 509  transactions reporting financial data  were $115billion and    $289million - compared to $391billion and    $718million in 2015 respectively.  The Information Technology sector sees a higher concentration of larger transactions; where as the Advanced Manufacturing sectors sees a higher concentration of smaller transactions.

Photonics Core Technology Companies
Although most diversified market leaders in Photonics are not acquisitive in 2016, there are four atypically large transactions announced or closed in Photonics.

OmniVision Technologies, Inc. by Shanghai Pudong Science and   Technology Investment Co., Ltd.; CITIC Capital Partners; Gold Stone   Investment Co., Ltd.; Hua Capital Management Ltd. for $1,886mm
Newport Corp. by MKS Instruments, Inc. (NasdaqGS:MKSI) for $1,045mm
Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. by Coherent, Inc. (NasdaqGS:COHR) for $956mm
Heptagon Micro Optics Pte Ltd by ams AG (SWX:AMS) for $919mm

For a presentation of M&A activity in the Photonics industry, join us at Lasers & Photonics Marketplace Seminar on January 30 at Photonics West in San Francisco or visit this webpage after the seminar.
Materials and Coatings
Recent advances in commercially available materials and their related    photonics technologies are driving innovation in lighting, life    sciences, information technology and solar.  10% of the total M&A  market volume is in Materials and Coatings - suppliers of    fundamental materials such as rare earths, organic LED materials,   dielectric optical coatings, semiconductors,  nanoparticles, sapphire    and display glasses.
Small and Middle Market
49% of researched transactions disclosed the transaction value. Consistent with previous five years, 81% are small   market (<$5M), micro  middle market  ($5 to $25M), and small/middle   market ($25 to $100M) transactions.
Since 2010, the lower and middle of the M&A middle markets is     robust. These researched transactions are consistent with the  market    as a whole.  However, uniquely, in the Photonics sector  and  the   vertical market segments enabled by photonics, strategic  buyers  are   acquiring orders of magnitude smaller businesses providing   products that   are highly differentiated with strong intellectual   property positions.

 
Strategic vs. Financial on Buy and Sell Side
Like 2012 through 2015, the vast majority of transactions by volume  and   value are  strategic. However, financial buyers and sellers are   consistently more  active since 2012.  Financial buyers are up to 20% from   3% of transactions  and financial sellers are up to 21% from 12% of transactions in 2012.   Considering strategic buyers are more active in 2014, 2015 and 2016, this may be considered   seller's market with higher strategic premiums in valuations for both   strategic and financial buyers.
Valuations
For researched market segments, the    average and median of reported Enterprise Value to EBIT, EBITDA and    Revenue multiples in 2014 to 2016 trend higher  since 2012 and 2013.  Implied    Enterprise Value includes  implied equity value, earn-out and    contingent payments, rights,  warrants, options, and net assumed    liabilities adjusted for size.

The Ophthalmics (Biophotonics), Semiconductor Equipment (Advanced Manufacturing), Surveillance and Navigation (Defense, Security and Sensing), and Metrology (Advanced Manufacturing) segments   realize high average multiples of Enterprise Value to  Revenue   due to strategic acquisitions of middle market companies  with   strong IP portfolios and high return on investment for the capital equipment they provide.
High average multiples of Enterprise Value to EBITDA are realized by Xiamen Changelight Co., producer of ultra-bright LED epitaxial wafers and chips, gallium arsenide solar cells, and LED lighting products in China (250x EBITDA); VirtualScopics, provider of medical imaging services to pharma and biotech clinical trials (195x); and MNTech Co., manufacturer of optical films for displays in South Korea (176x    EBITDA).

Few transactions report financials, because buyers    are not required to report publicly if a transaction does not have material near term    impact on their financial statements. Regardless, M&A transaction data is highly   relevant to understand  market dynamics and buyer behavior.

Geography
Historically, the United States and Canada, as a geographical region,   experience  the most buy and sell side activity.  This trend is  changing.  In 2015 and 2016, we see a much higher concentration  of targets in Asia and Europe and of buyers in Asia.
  
Up from more than 25% in 2014 and 18% in 2015, more transactions  represent buyers acquiring targets outside their geographical region. 
Most Active Buyers
Strategic buyers are by far the most active - acquiring   small and  middle market companies across a wide breadth of photonic technology  enabled market segments. Unlike in 2014 and years prior, there are not a relatively  large number of acquisitions per strategic buyer.  Inconsistent with previous years, a new set of buyers top the most active buyers lists in 2016.
