	Grand Plastic Technology Corporation operates within the Special industry machinery sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Grand Plastic Technology with three other
	
			companies in this sector in Taiwan:
		
	All Ring Tech Co., Ltd.
	
		(2016
	sales of 2.11 billion Taiwanese Dollars [US$69.92  million]
		of which 88%
		was Wanrun),
	
	Taliang Technology Co., Ltd.
	
		(2.02 billion Taiwanese Dollars [US$66.77  million]
		), and
	
	San Lien Technology Corp.
	
		(2.14 billion Taiwanese Dollars [US$70.78  million]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		Grand Plastic Technology were 2.16 billion Taiwanese Dollars (US$71.61 million).
	
		This
		
			is
		
				an
			
			increase of 8.3%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 2.00 billion Taiwanese Dollars.
	
		Sales of Other Departments saw an increase
		
			that was more than double the company's growth rate: sales were up
		84.6% in 2016, from
		73.52 million Taiwanese Dollars to 135.69 million Taiwanese Dollars.
		Grand Plastic Technology also saw significant increases in sales in
						Chemical Material Manufacturing (up 13.9% to 486.70 million Taiwanese Dollars)

More...About Stock PerformanceThe most basic way for computing stock performance is to calculate the price change of the stock over a period of time, shown in percentage. It is also useful to calculate the relative performance of a stock comparing its price change with the change of a benchmark index over the same period. Benchmarking stocks on the basis of their performance could be more complex when calculating total return, which consists in adding to the stock price change any other return from an investment over the period, such as dividends. Furthermore, currency conversion rate must be considered when the investment is made in a different currency, as the exchange rate change over the period affects the actual return of the stock investment.
