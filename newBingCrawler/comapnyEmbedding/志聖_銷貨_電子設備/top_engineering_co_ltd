LCD Dispenser


				[LCD Dispenser]
			

				Divided into two parts, seal dispenser and liquid crystal dispenser, LCD
dispenser is essential equipment in One Drop Filling (ODF) processing of
LCD manufacturing.
Seal dispenser dispenses amounts of sealant in a specific pattern of any of
two substrates to assemble the TFT array substrate and the color filter array,
while liquid crystal dispenser dispenses amounts of liquid crystal to form a
layer of liquid crystal on a glass substrate.
After developing the first LCD dispenser in the county in 2002 and
revising it by employing Step Pumping technology later, Top Engineering¡¯s
LCD dispenser realizes minute and accurate liquid crystal dispensing, saving
about 30% of liquid crystal used and manufacturing time respectively, thus significantly improving the
productivity compared with 7th generation equipment.
Top Engineering specializes in manufacturing equipment for semiconductor, LCD, LED and optical modules.
The company¡¯s LCD dispenser has captured as much as 60% of the 8th- generation dispenser market in the world
since 2008, surpassing Hitachi. The company also produces GSC(glass cutting system) and array tester.
