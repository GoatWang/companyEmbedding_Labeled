A History of Growth
Mirae Asset was founded in 1997 in the wake of the Asian currency crisis with a vision of and dedication to serving our clients, helping them build wealth for life with proven investment strategies. 
Our endeavor to expand overseas began in 2003 with the establishment of our Hong Kong office, which has become the backbone of our Asian and Emerging Market investment capabilities and product offering. These strategies were dedicated to diversifying the investment base for investors and were the starting point for our focus on the broader emerging markets. Since their inception we have consistently enhanced our coverage and presence in the emerging markets and are now one of the world’s largest emerging market investors.
We are committed to securing future levers of growth and providing value to our clients, as evidenced in our milestones.
