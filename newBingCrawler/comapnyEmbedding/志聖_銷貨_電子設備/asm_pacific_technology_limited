History
ALSI originated from the semiconductor industry and has a clear understanding of how to meet the driving forces in this industry. ALSI was founded in the year 2001 as a spin off from Philips Semiconductors and started with a transfer of knowhow and patents from Royal Philips NV, through which ALSI has obtained the unique Intellectual Property Rights on multiple beam laser separation technology.
The Philips laser dicing technology was proven by the billions of separated units, and ALSI continued the development of this proprietary technology and introduced it to the whole semiconductor industry. Meanwhile ALSI’s technologies have lead to a breakthrough in the LED and RF-IC industry; wafers of High Brightness LED’s and GaAs RF-IC’s for mobile communication are increasingly diced by ALSI’s Multiple Laser Beam Process, in which ALSI has achieved a leading position. ASM Laser Separation International (ALSI) is a wholly owned subsidiary of ASM Pacific Technology Ltd (ASM PT),  which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and is  the world’s largest assembly and packaging equipment supplier.
ALSI will serve as the Group’s Advanced  Laser Technology Centre to develop new processes and supply systems for laser dicing and grooving applications in the semiconductor industry.

About our applications



RFIC
The vast majority of RFIC devices used in cellular phones and wireless infrastructures are made of GaAs substrates. GaAs material is most competitive for high frequency, high speed and/or low power consumption for components such as power amplifiers and switches.

Multibeam Process
Compared to mechanical separation methods such as sawing or scribing and breaking laser dicing offers mainly three key advantages:

A smaller separation width.
A reduction of the throughput time.
An increased yield.
Unidirectional (sawing)
Bi-directional (laser dicing)

Machine Concepts
The design of ASM ALSI machine platform has been made with productive and accurate laser dicing of semiconductor wafers in mind. It incorporates over 12 years of experience in laser dicing of wafers originally at NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductor), and the extensive know-how available in the well-established semiconductor equipment manufacturers in The Netherlands and Germany.

V-DOE
ASMPT has developed a proprietary process with a unique V-DOE Multi beam process for dicing thin Si (<<100um) IC (low-K) wafers with low CoO and while achieving a high Die Strength (typically >500MPa).
This technology allows in a single process step to dice through the Low-K/metal/passivation top layers, Si substrate and DAF or FOW with a high quality and die strength without the need for additional process steps which is the case with other separation technologies such as DBG, SDBG, GAL or Plasma Read more…







Spot to lane (S2L)
Automatic S2L ensure that the first lane processed on the wafer to be in the correct position. While Kerf check on the fly monitors the performance while processing, S2L ensures also the first lane on the wafer to be in the correct position. Read more…






Matrix Grooving
As metal layers are increasing in thickness a single pass single row pass is not sufficient to achieve the required grooving depth. Matrix grooving allows to utilize the available laser power and convert power into productivity increase while maintaining small HAZ. Read more…






Active Mounts
As in all precision machines, the accelerating mass of the stage introduces deformation and vibrations in the frames, negatively influencing attainable accuracy.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE U.S. PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

	In addition to historical information, some of the information posted or referenced on this Website contains statements relating to our future business and / or results, including, among others, statements regarding future revenue, sales, income, expenditures, sufficiency of cash generated from operations, maintenance of majority interest in ASM Pacific Technology Ltd., business strategy, product development, product acceptance, market penetration, market demand, return on investment in new products, facility completion dates and product shipment dates, corporate transactions, restructurings, liquidity and financing matters, outlooks, and any other non- historical information. These statements include certain projections and business trends, which are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


	You can identify these statements by the use of words like “may”, “could”, “should”, “project”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “expect”, “plan”, “estimate”, “forecast”, “potential”, “intend”, “continue” and variations of these words or comparable words. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. You should be aware that our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic conditions and trends in the semiconductor industry and the duration of industry downturns, currency fluctuations, the timing of significant orders, market acceptance of new products, competitive factors, litigation involving intellectual property, shareholder and other issues, commercial and economic disruption due to natural disasters, terrorist activity, armed conflict or political instability, epidemics and other risks indicated in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 20-F and other filings from time to time with the SEC and other regulators. The risks described are not the only ones facing ASM. Some risks are not yet known and some that we do not currently believe to be material could later become material. Each of these risks could materially affect our business, revenues, income assets, liquidity and capital resources.  All statements are made as of the date of posting unless otherwise noted, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or circumstances.
