Euronext launches options on the PSI 20® Index 



 






At the time of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the PSI 20 futures contacts

Lisbon – 29 June 2016– Euronext is pleased to announce the launch of options on the PSI 20® Index (trading symbol: PSX). Through today’s listing on the Euronext derivatives market these options are made available for trading to the broad European derivatives community.

	The PSI 20 options, that complement the existing future and ETF contracts based on the PSI20 Index, offer institutional and retail investors a new way to obtain, manage or hedge exposure to the Portuguese benchmark. The extension of the product offering will enlarge possibilities to act on the developments in the Portuguese economy. The launch of the options on the PSI 20 is a sign of the continuing demand for derivatives contracts on Portugal’s main index.

	The new options on the PSI 20 will benefit from day one from continuous competitive on-screen price transparency and a Liquidity Provider Programme, supported by Susquehanna International Securities Ltd.The options are centrally cleared so investors can profit from the capital and operational efficiencies of clearing trades in the same clearing pool as their existing Euronext positions.

	As from 27 June, professional investors can also report flex PSI 20 option contracts via AtomX, Euronext’s flexible service that offers the efficiency and security of the regulated market and central clearing to bilaterally negotiated trades. This allows these investors to tailor certain parameters of the contract to suit their bespoke needs (trading symbol: ZPQ).

	Liquidity will be provided by Susquehanna International Securities Ltd which is part of SIG Susquehanna-one of the largest market making firms in Europe and worldwide. Javier Arrazubi of SIG Susquehanna said“We are excited to be on board as a Primary market maker for the new PSI20 options listing and will be publishing consistent two-way prices on the screens in order to inject liquidity.  We are also happy to provide prices to institutional clients who wish to contact us directly, crossing on exchange.”

	Ricardo Dias de Sousa, from Altura Markets: “Altura Markets is proud to witness the launch of the PSI 20 listed options. It has been 20 years since the future was listed and we hope to have nurtured it and helped to trade it in a way that adds value to our clients  throughout the years. We are eager to do the same with the options from inception.”

	Daniel Mendes, BBVA added: “Launching PSI 20 options is a big step for Euronext and should be very positive for the Portuguese equity market in general. Investors will have at their disposal a wider range of instruments and possible strategies to invest in the Portuguese market. BBVA welcomes this initiative from Euronext and expects to reinforce its long term commitment to the Portuguese equity derivatives market.”

	Adam Rose, Head of Financial Derivatives at Euronext added: “Euronext is happy to extend its derivatives offer on the PSI 20 Index via the option contracts. Through this launch we can immediately offer an alternative to clients continuously seeking for new trading opportunities within the safe and transparent environment of Euronext .”

PSI 20
	The PSI 20® Index is the Portuguese benchmark which incorporates the companies with the highest market capitalisation listed on Euronext Lisbon. The PSI 20® has a broad sector coverage that includes banks, services, oil and energy, telecommunications and media.
	Selection of companies is based on free float market capitalisation and is subject to liquidity requirements to ensure tradability of products based on the index.

PSI 20 Futures
	PSI 20® Index Futures will continue to be listed on the Lisbon Derivatives Market. Clients will be able to execute strategies involving both the future and the option on the Portuguese benchmark.

PSI 20 Options
	PSI 20® exchange listed options will also benefit from:

7 major financial institutions join forces to develop blockchain infrastructure for SME post-trade 



 





Paris – 21 June 2016 –BNP Paribas Securities Services, Caisse des Dépôts, Euroclear, Euronext, S2iEM and Société Générale, in collaboration with Paris EUROPLACE, today announced that they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore together the development of a post-trade blockchain infrastructure for SMEs in Europe.
Open to other international partners, this pilot agreement aims to improve SMEs' access to capital markets while facilitating secure and transparent post-trade operations. It is part of the development of a new regulatory environment in France that allows the issue and circulation of securities using blockchain technology.
The partnership's main objective is to combine its members' financing capacity and expertise to promote innovation through a new, independent company whose mission will be to harness blockchain technology in the design, development and deployment of innovative solutions for post-trade. By reducing transaction costs while maintaining a high level of security, the company would help SMEs raise funds more easily on capital markets. Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly enhance and streamline post-trade operations by facilitating securities registration for the European market and allowing fast execution of trades with clearing & settlement in real time at T+0.  
The new partners issued a joint statement noting: “We wanted to engage collaboratively in order to mount an innovative project with the potential to  drive the transformation of the post-trade market. By pooling our strengths in this ground-breaking area, we are focusing on new solutions that will give small and mid-sized companies -- key actors for growth in Europe  – easier access to the financing they need. With this project, we are securing the means to seize opportunities that blockchain distribution can offer: speed of execution, low cost and security.”
Blockchain technology is based on a virtual ledger that assembles data for shared distribution  between many different  users. To appear in the ledger, data must be organized in blocks, each bearing a digital signature verified by users. New blocks can only be added to the chain if they are approved by the majority of users, and if the new unit is in keeping with existing blocks. Once added to the chain, the block is linked to these validated, unalterable blocks. The resulting decentralised security mechanism makes blockchain a pioneering technology that is widely used for data transmission.

Successful debut of Portuguese Treasury Bonds dedicated to retail

Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris – 17 May 2016– Euronext today announced the first issue of Treasury Bonds, dedicated to retail investors, to be listed in its regulated market on May 19. Initially set at €350 million, the Portuguese Treasury and Debt Management Agency (IGCP), which has issued this “OTRV Maio 2021” bond on behalf of the Portuguese government, increased the total amount to €750 million based on the demand surge on the first day of the subscription period.

	During the subscription period, which took place between 26 April and 16 May, the “OTRV Maio 2021” bond demand exceeded €1.2 billion.

	Over 95% of the treasury bonds to retail were purchased by Portuguese investors, around 37,000 in total, and the remaining 5% were bought by foreign investors residing in Portugal. The average value of the inserted orders was over €31,000 each.

	This was the largest bond issue ever processed on Euronext Lisbon centralisation system, totalling close to 39,000 valid orders.

	The “OTRV Maio 2021” bond pay a semi-annual variable interest rate equal to the 6-month Euribor rate plus 2.20%, with a minimum interest rate of 2.20% (Annual Gross Nominal Rate) and reach maturity on 19 May 2021. The banks BPI, CGD and Novo Banco were the global organisers and coordinators of this treasury bond sale.

	"The issuance of Portuguese treasury bonds which will be admitted to trading on Euronext Lisbon was a success. The OTRV is a new instrument which satisfies the investment needs of a class of savers looking for profitable, secure and liquid solutions, enabling private investors to purchase treasury bonds trading on the Stock Exchange. The demand clearly shows that the Portuguese people are savers and that they trust the savings instruments from the State. The Republic deserves to be trusted by the Portuguese people. The Portuguese believe that an inclusive economic growth, within the framework of institutional and political stability, is a guarantee for well-being and that is the model for sustainable growth”, stated Ricardo Mourinho Félix, Secretary of State Assistant, of the Treasury and of Finance‎.

	 “Since 2012, the IGCP has been committed to boosting the retail sector in order to build a stable base of the national public debt market. The launching of the OTRV is part of this strategy. It introduces retail public debt products for commercialisation in the banking sector, and we are very pleased with the reaction of the target audience. Thus, the IGCP will continue to work towards improving the offer making adjustments to meet the needs of the retail market and the national market, consolidating in this way another financing source of the Portuguese government”, said Cristina Casalinho, President of IGCP.

 “It is with great pleasure that Euronext announced today the admission to trading on the regulated markets of the first issue of Portuguese Treasury Bonds with nation-wide distribution and a strong demand by private investors. This is a highly positive moment in time for the capital markets and it is the culmination of a joint effort with the IGCP focusing on increasing the offer of financial products”, stated Isabel Ucha, the interim CEO of Euronext Lisbon.

Euronext Releases Its New Strategic Plan: “Agility for Growth” 



 







Set of new financial targets for the 2015-2019 period

Further strengthening of core business, excluding clearing operations, to deliver: 


Revenue growth of 2% CAGR

Cost base reduction of €22 million gross



Selected growth initiatives to contribute €70 million additional revenue and €35 million incremental costs at the end of the period

Group EBITDA margin excluding clearing operations to reach 61 to 63% in 2019


Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, London and Paris – 13 May 2016– Today Euronext announces its strategic plan “Agility for Growth”. Following the delivery of its IPO objectives a year in advance, Euronext has defined its growth ambitions to 2019. Under this plan, Euronext will enhance its agility in order to strengthen the resilience of its core business, to capture strategic opportunities and to grow in selected segments. The driver of this plan is to fulfil Euronext’s core mission: power pan-European capital markets to finance the real economy, while delivering value to shareholders.

Enhancing agility

	Euronext will implement a disciplined innovation strategy, intensify client centricity, continue to reduce cost, strengthen its information technology and infrastructure platform, attract and develop best talent and entrepreneurs and deploy a disciplined M&A programme to accelerate its growth strategy in selected segments.

Leveraging the current environment

	Euronext will benefit from a broadly favourable environment driven by three factors. The Euro area economic environment is expected to remain supportive of Euronext’s core business, as Quantitative Easing and low interest rates continue to drive investors’ search for yield. Innovation in capital markets will offer Euronext opportunities to develop new services with clients. The ongoing regulatory changes will increasingly drive value towards transparent, neutral, centrally cleared, open and regulated markets.

Strengthening core business and growing in selected segments

	Euronext will further strengthen its core business, creating value for clients and shareholders alike, and grow in selected segments to diversify revenue streams and scale Euronext’s businesses.

	The main drivers for strengthening Euronext’s core business will be to:


		Expand Euronext’s listing business to further finance the real economy in Europe;

		Maintain the Company’s successful strategy of optimising its core cash equity business to remain the market of reference for trading in Euronext listed companies;

		Extend the product mix of the derivatives franchise to deliver risk management tools for clients and provide OTC trade capture services; and

		Leverage Euronext’s index platform and market data franchise to enrich the value proposition for customers.


	Euronext will also focus on six growth initiatives in selected segments to:


		Add value to issuers, with two ambitions: become the exchange for European Tech SMEs and build the modular corporate services provider on data analytics, and

		Add value to investors, with four ambitions: provide a one-stop-shop pan-European ETF platform, launch a Euronext branded European family of indices, become  a specialist content provider on agricultural commodities while capturing OTC flows, and deliver choice in clearing in cash markets, create optionalities in derivatives clearing and diversify the post trade franchise.


Accelerating profitable growth through targeted mergers and acquisitions

	In order to accelerate Euronext’s standalone strategy, its growth ambitions will be achieved both organically, leveraging on its existing assets and talents, and inorganically, through disciplined and selected bolt-on acquisitions. The overall amount allocated to development costs and bolt-on acquisitions will be comprised between €100 and €150 million over the period.

	In an evolving industry landscape, Euronext will carefully assess any  potential opportunity resulting in a transformational transaction that will create value for clients and shareholders.

Setting ambitious financial objectives

	Euronext’s strategy “Agility for Growth” translates into a set of new financial objectives. Clearing operations are excluded from 2019 targets, as Euronext’s clearing contracts with LCH.Clearnet SA expire at the end of 2018. Euronext is exploring all possible avenues for the clearing of its operations and intends to develop optionality for its clients that will bring the same financial benefits to the Company as the current arrangement does.

	Euronext’s core business revenue will grow by a 2% CAGR over the 2015 – 2019 period [1]. On top of this, the six new growth initiatives will bring about €70 million of additional revenue. As a result, Group revenue will grow by a CAGR of 5% over the period, up to about €575 million, vs. €467 million in 2015, excluding clearing revenue.

	Cost management will remain a key pillar of Euronext’s strategy to 2019. A target of €22 million of gross efficiencies has been identified, representing about €15 million net, taking into account an annual inflation rate of 1% over the period. The restructuring costs requested to deliver the additional cost efficiencies are estimated at 1.5 times the gross efficiencies, or €33 million.

	The completion of the strategic plan and the growth initatives will induce about €35 million of additional operational expenses. On a net basis, the Company’s cost base will then increase by about 1% CAGR over the period. Euronext’s EBITDA margin is expected to range between 61% and 63% by 2019.

Enhancing shareholder value

	Euronext intends to pursue a very disciplined capital allocation policy. The Managing Board has proposed to confirm the dividend policy of 50% of reported earnings, enabling the Company to reach the objectives set by its strategic plan. This includes the possibility to execute its value accretive bolt-on acquisition strategy while maintaining sufficient financial flexibility for potential transformational transactions.

	Euronext considers its capital management policy as a core priority and a key part of its value proposition to shareholders, and will return any excess of capital on its balance sheet in the absence of transformational deals during the period.

[1]This growth has to be calculated based on 2015 revenue excluding clearing.
