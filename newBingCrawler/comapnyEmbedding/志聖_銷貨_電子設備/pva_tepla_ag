PVA TePla AG / Germany






The TWIN-SC4 system is a fully-automatic implant monitoring system based on photo thermal measurement for accurate implant dose control and monitoring on product wafers. It has inline capability and its measurement principle is based on patented double modulation technique.










Product Lineup








Semiconductor Metrology Equipment








TWIN-SC4 is designed as a modular standalone system, which can be configured with handling modules and load ports for different wafer diameters and clean room concepts up to 300mm wafer size.
The SIRD (Scanning Infrared Depolarisation) tool is a non-contacting, non-destructive stress field imager for semiconductor wafers with inline capability. Rapid and precise stress field imaging is based on specially developed homodyne retarder techniques, patented by JenaWave. SIRD can be used as stand-alone tool for different wafer sizes, if manually loaded, or as a fully automated unit for 300mm wafer by adding a robot controlled handling attachment.

Plasma Pen
The PlasmaPen™ is a patented atmospheric plasma system used to solve surface preparation problems. The PlasmaPen™ produces high density plasma with a low heating effect, giving it the ability to clean and activate the surfaces including low melting point polymers. Our worldwide customer base uses the PlasmaPen™ for a broad range of applications that span the Life Science, Electronics and Industrial markets.
 
The PlasmaPen™ cleans and activates the surface of materials promoting wettability of potting compounds, adhesives, inks, paints and dyes. Surface cleaning with the PlasmaPen™ ensures reliable wire and die bonding for semiconductor packaging. It has shown particular success in adhesion promotion of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) used in flat panel display manufacturing.
