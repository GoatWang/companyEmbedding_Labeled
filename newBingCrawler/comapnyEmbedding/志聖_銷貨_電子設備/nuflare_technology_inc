簡介

全球微影製程設備市場，預計2014∼2019年以0.28%的年複合成長率(CAGR)成長。市場成長的主要原因，為智慧型手機、平板電腦需求的增加，及可攜式電子設備更換周期縮短等。另一方面，一般認為由於半導體IC的供給過剩、廠商設備投資縮小影響，微影製程設備的需求將減少。

Product Code: IRTNTR7790Market outlook of the lithography systems market
Following the growth of the electronic device industry, the demand for semiconductor ICs for different applications, such as communication, consumer electronic devices, memory devices, and sensor devices increases, thereby, driving the need for the lithography systems. Moreover, the growing demand for compact electronic devices and for large panel displays has increased the demand for ArF and KrF lithography systems. Technavio predicts the global lithography systems market to display a healthy growth, reaching revenues worth of USD 8.07 billion by 2019.
In terms of geographical revenue contribution, the APAC region dominated the lithography system market, accounting for a share of over 71% in 2014, followed by the US, and Europe. Factors such as the solid presence of semiconductor IC manufacturers in APAC is one of the major reasons for the high revenue contribution from this region.
Segmentation by technology and analysis of - ArF Dry, ArF Immersion, KrF, EUV, and i-line
As of 2014, the ArF (ArF Dry and ArF Immersion) segment was the largest revenue generator of the lithography systems market and accounted for a revenue share of over 77%. The main reason behind the market dominance of ArF excimer lithography systems is the miniaturization of semiconductor ICs.

NuFlare Technology, Inc. was founded in 2002 as a spinoff of the Semiconductor Equipment Division
of Toshiba Machine Co. Ltd. Since that time, we have developed and provided state-of-the-art electron
beam mask writers, mask inspection systems and epitaxial growth systems for the manufacture of
semiconductor devices, thereby contributing to the development of the semiconductor industry.

Today, semiconductor devices are widely used in communication devices, home appliances,
automobiles and other personal and home products, many of which are interconnected via
communication networks to create new value and support a good life for people. Accompanying the
rapid evolution of semiconductor technology, demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is
becoming increasingly challenging and diverse.
We have over thirty years of experience in developing electron beam mask writers that print IC circuit
patterns on photomasks. Photomasks are quartz plates used to transfer IC circuit patterns onto silicon
wafers for semiconductor devices, and play a pivotal role in micro- and nano-fabrication processes by
improving productivity and device performance. NuFlare’s electron beam mask writers lead the
industry and are valued by customers worldwide.

Our mask inspection systems, which identify defects in the printed patterns on photomasks, are also
highly valued by our customers.
Furthermore, epitaxial growth systems for power devices are expected to find more widespread use in
electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications. Epitaxial growth systems are currently moving from the
development phase to use in practical applications.
NuFlare Technology will maintain advanced technological capabilities to provide semiconductor
manufacturing equipment that meets customer needs in a timely manner, and sustain our vision that
states “Contributing through leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing equipment to the advance of
the semiconductor industry, society, and mankind.”
We wish to express our gratitude for your patronage and look forward to your continued support.

                                        Intel Corporation is an American multinational semiconductor chip maker corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Intel is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip maker, based on revenue. It is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers. Intel Corporation, founded on July 18, 1968, is a portmanteau of Integrated Electronics (the fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information was also quite suitable). Intel also makes motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. Founded by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove, Intel combines advanced chip design capability with a leading-edge manufacturing capability. Though Intel was originally known primarily to engineers and technologists, its "Intel Inside" advertising campaign of the 1990s made it and its Pentium processor household names.
