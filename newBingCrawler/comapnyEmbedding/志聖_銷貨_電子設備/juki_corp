The History of Juki America, Inc
Juki Corporation, the parent company of Juki America, Inc., has been a world leader in sewing machine technology for over 75 years. The firm now supplies 170 nations with sewing equipment and related products, representing 67% of their overall revenue. The balance of their business includes home sewing machines and the Juki SMT mounting and assembly systems. Juki Corporation headquarters is located in Tokyo, Japan, with subsidiaries worldwide. 
     
    Juki's insight into the world of sewing machine manufacturing began with home machines in 1947. They progressed to basic industrial machines before advancing to electronic units and the automated sewing systems of today. Their current slogan: “Mind and Technology” reflects their global philosophy of providing customers with the highest quality product and services according to their specific needs.
Juki in the Western Hemisphere
In 1974, Juki realized the importance of a growing U.S. market, and established Juki Industries of America in New York City. This subsidiary grew to account for 21% of Juki's global business, and moved to a larger facility in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. By 1988, Juki's market had again expanded, and a new U.S. headquarters was built to handle administrative, sales, marketing, parts, technical and warehousing services. The company name was officially changed to Juki America, Inc., and the Canadian market was added. A sister company, Juki Panama S.A., was incorporated in 1978 to handle the Latin American market. As business grew throughout Central and South America, this subsidiary was moved to the new headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey and renamed Juki Latin America, Inc.  In 1993, Juki America, Inc. and Juki Latin America, Inc. merged under the name of Juki America, Inc. 
     
    Juki Corporation purchased the Union Special Corporation (located in Huntley, Illinois) in 1988. Both company’s sales and marketing divisions then merged to become Juki Union Special, Inc. from 1996 to 2006.
     
    In the year 2000, Juki America moved headquarters to Doral, Florida to better serve their customers in North and South America. In November of 2006, the corporate name returned to Juki America, Inc. and an authorized Juki distributor network was reorganized. These distributors, strategically located throughout the Western Hemisphere, are trained directly by Juki staff to provide sales, marketing, technical service and training in the true Juki quality tradition.
     
    In 2009 the Juki America Parts Center installed a state-of-the-art racking system to speed delivery and streamline warehouse inventory operations.
The Complete Product Line
Juki offers an extensive line of sewing equipment for the apparel industry -- ranging from lockstitch, overlock and coverstitch machines, to electronic bartackers and automated sewing systems. They have also become predominant in the heavy-duty sewing market, supplying such industries as automotive, upholstery, marine, industrial fabrics, footwear, leather products and home textiles. The Juki line of home sewers and sergers have become one of the most popular in the home market.
