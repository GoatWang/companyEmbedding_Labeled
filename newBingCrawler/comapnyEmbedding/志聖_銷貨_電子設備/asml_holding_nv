ASML’s corporate headquarters in Veldhoven


The photolithography machines manufactured by ASML are used in the production of computer chips. In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon wafer that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material (photoresist). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging that ASML's machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits, and as of 2010, ASML has 67 percent of the worldwide sales of lithography machines,[2] with the competition consisting of Ultratech, Canon and Nikon.
Immersion lithography[edit]
As of 2011, their high-end Twinscan NXT:1950i system is used for producing features down to 32 nanometres (and outlook for 22 nm) at up to 200 wafers per hour,[3] using a water immersion lens and an argon fluoride laser that produces light at a wavelength of 193 nm. As of 2011, an average lithography machine costs 27 million euros.[4]
EUV lithography[edit]
ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that produce 13.5 nm wavelength light. A high-energy laser is focused on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which emits EUV light. In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world’s first functional 22 nm CMOS SRAM memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine.[5] Series-produced (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped in 2011.[4]
Other[edit]
In addition to immersion-based lithography and EUV lithography, ASML has a substantial intellectual property portfolio covering imprint lithography.[6]
Company[edit]
ASML’s corporate headquarters is in Veldhoven, Netherlands. It is also the location for research, development, manufacturing and assembly. ASML has a worldwide customer base and over sixty service points in sixteen countries. The company is listed on both the AEX and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges, as ASML.
The company (originally named ASM Lithography)[7] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch companies Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) and Philips. Nowadays it is a public company with only a minority of the shares owned by Philips.[8] When the company became independent in 1988, it was decided that changing the name was not desirable, and the abbreviation ASML became the official company name.[9] In 2000, ASML acquired the Silicon Valley Group (SVG), a US lithography equipment manufacturer, in a bid to supply 193 nm scanners to Intel Corp.[10][11]
ASML is subject to cyclical industrial dynamics. For example, at the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide—mostly contract workers[12]—and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs .[13] Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.[14]
In July 2012, Intel announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers and further development of EUV lithography.[15][16] This deal is without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML is offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.[17] In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.[18] As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer Cymer in October 2012.[19] In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced semiconductors.[20]

Combining high productivity with ultra low-k1, this dual-stage immersion lithography tool is designed for volume production on 300-mm wafers at 38-nm resolution and beyond.Building on the successful in-line catadioptric lens design concept first employed in the XT:1700Fi, the XT:1950Hi has a numerical aperture (NA) of 1.35 – the highest in the industry. This compact and mechanically stable lens design has the same image orientation as purely refractive lens designs, ensuring full reticle compatibility with non-immersion systems as well as the XT:1700Fi. Optional additional control features improve lens stability and aberration control further.The illuminator features polarization at maximum throughput and extremely homogeneous pupil fill, making it perfectly adapted to ultra low-k1 pupil shapes. Customized illumination modes for ultra low-k1  and rotated structures can also be set. In addition to its polarization capabilities, the system comes equipped with an extended Ultra-k1 package comprising QUASAR XL, LithoGuide ILIAS, DoseMapper, Reticle Shape Correction, CDFEC and Focus Spot Monitor.Complementing its enhanced resolution, the XT:1950Hi delivers excellent overlay, CD uniformity and focus performance.

Top Traded FX Pair: GBP/USD
14% of trades in 2016 were on the GBP/USD major currency pair. The British pound to US dollar exchange rate (also known as the “Cable”), had a history-making year following the surprise U.K. vote to exit the European Union trading bloc in June. As a result, the Cable fell to a 31-year low, shedding, at one point, as much as 18% of its value.

TRADE GBP/USD NOW 
Number 2 Spot Goes To Crude Oil

During 2016, 11% of clients traded on Crude Oil (CL). Did you Know that over 80% of the world's crude oil reserves are located in OPEC Member Countries, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela? It should therefore come as no surprise that oil prices have both sunk (in the beginning of the year) and surged (in December) in light of the OPEC cartel’s talks and agreement to cut supply in a bid to clear a massive glut that has built up in recent years.


TRADE CRUDE OIL
Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) Comes In Third Place

Not surprisingly, 7% of trades in the past year were on the EUR/USD - Euro US Dollar. Both the USA and the Eurozone are considered among the world’s largest economic trade blocs. In fact, the US dollar is both the top traded and most widely held currency. The currency of the European Union, the Euro, is the world's second most popular currency.


TRADE EUR/USD NOW
Gold Stays Strong At 4th Place

When it comes to gold, traders are not much different than forex and stock traders. In fact, 5.5% of our clients traded on Gold spot prices this year. The precious metal has had a spectacular rise and fall in 2016, ending 2015 at $1,060 per ounce (near a six-year low) and finishing this year at around the same level.


TRADE GOLD CFDS
Closing Up The List Is The Yen (USD/JPY)

Running neck-and-neck with gold, approximately 5% of traders opened trades on the USD/JPY (US Dollar / Japanese Yen), the third most traded pair in the Forex Market. The forex pair acts as the main currency basis for Asian assets. In light of recent market volatility – the up and down movement of financial instruments – and the uncertainty and fear that it brings, this pair is considered a favourite of both novice and professional traders.


TRADE USD/JPY NOW
And What About Stock CFDs?

Global stocks have shot higher in the final weeks of the year, particularly those from the US. America’s major indices have all broken through new records after Donald Trump’s election and the Dow 30 is now racing toward 20,000. S&P 500 is on track for a 11% increase this year and the total returns on NASDAQ 100 exceed 9%.
