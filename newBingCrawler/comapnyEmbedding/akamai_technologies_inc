Edge Redirector Cloudlet 

 
Easily manage and offload high volumes of URL redirects to the Akamai Edge 

 
Providing operational simplicity, website performance, and origin offload, Edge Redirector offloads high volumes of 301 and 302 redirects to the Akamai Edge with an API and an easy to use interface that is intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.

For website and web application owners, managing the many URL redirects associated with regular marketing activities, CMS and platform migrations, or site architecture changes can be burdensome. Using 301 and 302 URL redirects are a great way to ensure your site content continues to be accessible as your site structure evolves over time. Vanity URLs are also useful for branding and marketing campaigns. But, as more redirects pile up as your site content changes location or is retired, URL redirects can become difficult to manage and when managed improperly can have a negative impact on SEO and performance. It’s easy to get bogged down by all the inbound requests from marketing teams to set up or change redirects on an ongoing basis. 


The Edge Redirector Cloudlet from Akamai is an application designed to help you easily manage large volumes of URL redirects and offload them to the Edge of the Akamai Intelligent Platform for additional performance and offload from your cloud computing infrastructure. 







Edge Redirector comes equipped with the Cloudlets Policy Manager, an intuitive rules based user interface to help you setup up and manage your URL redirects and can also be configured via an included API. Flexible match criteria and the ability to set start and end dates for redirects provides increased control over your content. Even easier, the Edge Redirector Cloudlet allows you to extend URL management capability to your marketing team without giving them full Akamai portal access saving you and your team lots of time and headaches responding to ticket requests. 


Edge Redirector decreases time to redirect from the Akamai Edge, effectively reducing round trips and provides additional origin offload. Unlike DIY or 3rd party solutions Edge Redirector takes advantage of the Akamai Intelligent Platform™ providing additional scale and performance in addition to offload. 


User Interface 


Cloudlets are self-provisioned and self-configured via Luna Property Manager and Cloudlets Policy Manager. You can also manage Cloudlets functionality via included API.

Akamai Technologies, Inc. is an American content delivery network (CDN) and cloud services provider headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States. Akamai's content delivery network is one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms, responsible for serving between 15 and 30 % of all web traffic.[6] The company operates a network of servers around the world and rents capacity on these servers to customers who want their websites to work faster by distributing content from locations close to the user. When a user navigates to the URL of an Akamai customer, their browser is redirected to one of Akamai's copies of the website.
The company was founded in 1998 by Daniel M. Lewin (then a graduate student at MIT) and MIT applied mathematics professor Tom Leighton. Lewin was killed aboard American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed in the September 11 attacks of 2001. Leighton currently serves as Akamai's CEO.
Akamai is a Hawaiian word meaning "intelligent" or "clever".

History[edit]
Akamai Technologies entered the 1998 MIT $50K competition with a business proposition based on their research, and were selected as one of the finalists.[7] By August 1998 they had developed a working prototype, and with the help of Jonathan Seelig, Preetish Nijhawan, and Randall Kaplan, they began taking steps to incorporate the company.[8]
In late 1998 and early 1999, a group of business professionals joined the founding team. Most notably, Paul Sagan, former president of New Media for Time Inc. and George Conrades, former chairman and chief executive officer of BBN Corp. and senior vice president of U.S. operations for IBM. Conrades became the chief executive officer of Akamai in April 1999 and led the company from start-up to sustained profitability and positive free cash-flow before turning the reins over to Sagan in 2005.[9][10][11] The company launched its commercial service in April 1999 and was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market from October 29, 1999.[12]
On July 1, 2001, Akamai was added to the Russell 3000 Index and Russell 2000 Index.[13]
In 2001, co-founder Daniel M. Lewin died in the September 11th attacks at the age of 31. Lewin was aboard American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center.[14]
In 2005, Paul Sagan was named chief executive officer of Akamai. Sagan worked to differentiate Akamai from its competitors by expanding the company's breadth of services.[11] Under his leadership the company grew to $1.37 billion in revenues.[15] Sagan served as chief executive officer until co-founder and current CEO, Tom Leighton, was elected to the position in 2013.[16]
Technologies[edit]
Akamai Intelligent Platform[edit]
The Akamai Intelligent Platform is a distributed cloud computing platform that operates worldwide. It is a network of over 216,000 servers[17] deployed in more than 120[17] countries. These servers reside in more than 1,500[17] of the world's networks gathering real time information about traffic, congestion, and trouble spots. Each Akamai server is equipped with proprietary software that uses complex algorithms to process requests from nearby users, and then serve the requested content.[18]
Content delivery process[edit]
The content delivery process begins with a user submitting a request to a browser. When a user enters a URL, a DNS request is triggered and an IP address is retrieved. With the IP address, the browser can then contact a web server directly for subsequent requests.[19] In a content delivery network structure, the domain name of the URL is translated by the mapping system into the IP address of an edge server to serve the content to the user.[18]
Akamai delivers web content over its Intelligent Platform by transparently mirroring elements such as HTML, CSS, software downloads, and media objects from customers' servers. The Akamai server is automatically picked depending on the type of content and the user's network location. Receiving content from an Akamai server close to the user allows for faster download times and less vulnerability to network congestion. Akamai claims to provide better scalability by delivering the content over the last-mile from servers close to end-users, avoiding the middle-mile bottleneck of the Internet.[20]
Peer-to-peer networking[edit]
In addition to using Akamai's own servers, Akamai delivers content from other end-users' computers, in a form of peer-to-peer networking.[21][22] When users request a download of some large files served by this system, it prompts them to download and install "Akamai NetSession Interface," a download manager used to reduce download time and to increase quality.[23] However, this software operates not merely as a download manager (delivering content from the Internet to the user's computer) but also as a peer-to-peer server, delivering content cached on the user's computer to other users' computers.
Network Operations Command Center[edit]
Akamai's Network Operations Command Center (NOCC) is used for proactive monitoring and troubleshooting of all servers in the global Akamai network.[24] The NOCC provides real time statistics of Akamai's web traffic. The traffic metrics update automatically and provide a view of the Internet traffic conditions on Akamai's servers and customer websites.[25]
State of the Internet[edit]
The State of the Internet report is a quarterly report Akamai releases based on data gathered from its Intelligent Platform, which provides global Internet statistics such as connection speed, broadband adoption, attack traffic, network connectivity, and mobile connectivity.[26][27]
Visualizing the Internet[edit]
Akamai’s data visualization tools display how data is moving across the Internet in real-time. Viewers are able to see global web conditions, malicious attack traffic, and Internet connectivity.[28] In addition, the net usage indices monitor global news consumption, industry specific traffic, and mobile trends.[29] Akamai also offers the Internet Visualization application, which allows users to view real-time data on their mobile device.[30]
OPEN Initiative[edit]
On October 9, 2013 Akamai announced its Open Initiative at the 2013 Akamai Edge Conference. OPEN allows customers and partners to develop and customize the way they interact with the Akamai Intelligent Platform. Key components of OPEN include system and development operations integration, real-time big data integration, and a single-point user interface.[31]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017, Akamai Technologies shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Capital Group Companies and others[81]).
Litigation[edit]
One of Akamai's patents covers a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network. Internet Web site proprietors (content providers) contract with Akamai to deliver their Web sites' content to individual Internet users. The patented method permits large files, such as video or music files, to be stored on Akamai's servers and accessed from those servers by Internet users. This increases the speed with which Internet users access the content from Web sites.
Unfortunately for Akamai, its patent was written in a way that called for or permitted actions by multiple persons or entities—such as the content provider customer and the company providing the CDN service.[82] Akamai's competitor Limelight chose to operate its allegedly infringing service in that manner—it performed most steps of the patented process and its customers performed a so-called tagging step. Under the interpretation of patent law at the time when Akamai decided to sue Limelight for patent infringement, a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps. The court therefore overturned a $40 million jury verdict in Akamai's favor.
Akamai initially lost the case, even taking it to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court returned the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, with an invitation to re-evaluate its rule, if it chose to do so, that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement. On remand, the Federal Circuit considered the matter en banc (all active judges of the circuit) and modified its rule. It now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if "an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance." On that basis, the Federal Circuit reinstated the $40 million jury verdict. It said that "Akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that Limelight conditions its customers' use of its content delivery network upon its customers' performance of" the steps that Limelight does not itself perform. This has been considered a substantial change in patent law. For further discussion of the case, see Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc.
Controversies[edit]
The National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation have reportedly used Facebook's Akamai content delivery network (CDN) to collect information on Facebook users.[83]
Akamai has been accused of blocking access to web sites for visitors using Tor.[84]

^ It is usually possible, however, to write such method patent claims in a way that all steps are performed by a single actor, for example, by replacing a step of sending a signal to the person performing the other steps with a step, instead, of receiving that signal. See, e.g., Michael Dzwonczyk Bulletproofing Method Claims for Post-Limelight Enforcement (Feb. 2014). Dzwonczyk asserts that the patent claim "could easily have been rewritten as a single-actor method claim that would not require the performance of any step by a second actor," and provides a rewritten version. See also Harold Wegner, Akamai II: Direct Infringement Déjà Vu (Aug. 2014) at 20-21, to similar effect.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Akamai（英语：Akamai Technologies）是一家总部位于美国马萨诸塞州剑桥市的内容分发网络和云服务提供商，是世界上最大的分布式计算平台之一，承担了全球15-30%的网络流量。[1]该公司经营着分布于世界各地的服务器网络，主要业务为出租服务器资源（如带宽和储存空间）给那些希望通过从靠近用户的服务器来分发内容来提高自己网站访问速度的客户。
多年来，他们的客户已包括蘋果公司、Facebook、微软、Twitter、TVB、國泰航空和healthcare.gov等。当用户浏览到Akamai的客户的网站时，他的浏览器将被重指向到Akamai服务器上的副本，以达到提速的目的，此操作对大部分客户而言完全透明。
