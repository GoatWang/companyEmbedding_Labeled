      Viad Corp. is a Phoenix, Arizona-based descendant of the Greyhound Bus
      line. The publicly traded company is primarily engaged in providing
      services for trade shows, conventions, and special events. Subsidiary GES
      Exposition Services, Inc. offers trade show layout and design, logistics
      planning, and show execution services for approximately 2,000 events each
      year. The Exhibitgroup/Giltspur subsidiary works with major companies to
      design, build, and dismantle trade show exhibitions, and provides
      exhibitor show program management services. To a lesser degree, Viad is
      also involved in the travel and recreation field. Brewsters Tours, Inc.
      offers travel services to attractions in the Canadian Rocky Mountains,
      such as The Columbia Icefield and Banff Gondola. A fourth Viad subsidiary,
      Glacier Park, Inc., is the principal concessionaire in Montana's
      Glacier Park, operating four lodges and three motor inns in the area.
    

      1920s Roots
    

      Viad's Greyhound corporate lineage dates to 1926 when Motor Transit
      Corp. was formed to provide bus service and become a consolidator in the
      young industry. In 1930 the company changed its name to Greyhound Corp.,
      then survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and emerged as the
      country's premiere bus line. But as business began to tail off in
      the 1960s, the company, under the leadership of Gerald H. Trautman, began
      to diversify into a wide range of businesses and refashioned itself as a
      conglomerate. In 1962 Greyhound became involved in equipment leasing
      through the acquisition of Boothe Leasing Corp. Two years later it turned
      to food services, picking up Prophet Co., renamed Greyhound Food
      Management Inc. In 1965 Greyhound added financial services to the mix,
      acquiring Travelers Express Co., Inc., which processed money orders.
      Greyhound acquired Carey Transportation, Inc. and 80 percent of Nassau Air
      Dispatch in 1969 to provide ground support to airlines serving the
      Bahamas. This business was then supplemented by the addition of Freeport
      Flight Services.
    

      The most significant move Greyhound made to diversify was the 1970 $400
      million acquisition of Chicago-based Armour & Company, the famous
      meatpacker founded in the 1860s. However, 100 years later the company
      faced a hostile takeover bid by General Host Corp. and convinced the
      Greyhound board to act as a white knight. After some legal wrangling,
      General Host sold its Armour stock to Greyhound, which acquired the rest
      of the company as well. Greyhound then unloaded much of Armour's
      assets, retaining the meatpacking business, renamed Armour Foods and the
      consumer productions division, Armour-Dial. Dial soap had been part of the
      Armour company since 1948 when its researchers used the packing
      operation's tallow byproduct to develop a new germicidal deodorant
      soap. In the 1950s Dial adopted the advertising slogan,
      "Aren't you glad you use Dial? Don't you wish
      everybody did?," which proved instrumental in Dial emerging as the
      leading deodorant soap in the country. So enduring was the slogan that
      Dial employed it for the next 40 years.
    

      On some levels Trautman had assembled a successful conglomerate, but the
      company was not embraced by Wall Street, which derisively referred to
      Greyhound as "the dog." Its earnings were erratic, up one
      year and down the next, and instead of viewing Greyhound as diversified,
      analysts criticized it for lacking focus. In 1982, a new chairman and
      chief executive officer, John W. Teets, was brought in to overhaul
      Greyhound. When his work was completed 14 years later, he would emerge as
      the chairman and CEO of Viad Corp.
    

      Teets grew up in Chicago in a blue collar home, the son of a crane
      operator who later started his own construction company.
       An indifferent student, Teets was uninterested in becoming a civil
      engineer as his father desired, instead finding himself drawn to the
      restaurant business. In his early 20s, with backing from his father, Teets
      bought an interest in the Winter Garden, a Chicago complex that included a
      shopping center, restaurant, and ice skating rink. The venture proved
      highly successful and Teets may have likely remained involved in this
      field and never worked for Greyhound had it not been for a string of
      tragedies that struck his life in 1963. First his wife died in her sleep
      from unknown causes, followed a few weeks later by the death of a brother
      from a gas leak on the job. Finally, in November of that year the Winter
      Garden was completely destroyed by fire. Teets was in total despair and it
      was only at the insistence of a close friend that he applied for a food
      management job that Greyhound was advertising. He was hired to run the
      Greyhound restaurants at the 1964 New York World's Fair and
      performed so well at the task that Greyhound made him president of Posts
      Houses, a bus terminal restaurant operator. After a few years Teets left
      Greyhound for stints with other restaurant operations, including Canteen
      Corp., where he worked for a taskmaster and conglomerate wizard Harold
      Geneen, who taught him the importance of being detail-oriented and how to
      squeeze the utmost from managers. In 1976 a much more seasoned Teets
      returned to Greyhound, lured back by Trautman to take over the struggling
      Food Service Group. With Geneen as his model, Teets whipped the subsidiary
      into shape and became heir to Trautman's top post.
    

      Teets told 
      
        Fortune
      
       in 1985 that "Trautman wasn't much of a tire
      kicker," and that "Greyhound was run with benign
      neglect." All that changed when Teets took charge in 1982.
      Insisting that all subsidiaries had to return at least 15 percent on
      equity, he was especially hard on the bus lines and meatpacking units
      which fell far short of that mark. He moved aggressively to take on the
      unions, demanding wage cuts from workers at Armour Foods, and when they
      refused he shuttered the company's 29 plants and sold the business
      to Conagra Inc., which in days reopened with thousands of non-union
      workers. Teets then turned his attention to his unionized bus drivers,
      which Greyhound paid at a much higher rate than the competition. His
      demand for a 17 percent wage and benefit cut resulted in a 47-day strike
      marred by violence. In the end he achieved a 15 percent giveback, but
      Greyhound had been severely hurt and despite a number of cost-cutting
      measures never fully recovered. In 1987 Teets sold the Greyhound bus
      company to Dallas investors for $350 million, although the company
      retained the Greyhound Corp. name.
    

      While casting off major assets, Teets added to existing businesses. In
      1986 the consumer products division acquired Ellio's Pizza and
      Purex Corp., maker of soap, bleach, and other household products that
      filled in gaps in Greyhound's product lines. A year later Greyhound
      acquired Carson Pirie Scott & Co.'s in-flight catering and
      airport terminal concession business. The 20 Mule Team division of United
      States Borax & Chemical Corp. and its household products were
      brought into the fold in 1988. The addition of Republic Money Orders, Inc.
      added to the financial services area. In 1990 Greyhound acquired the Breck
      hair care products business. In that same year, the company changed its
      name to Greyhound-Dial in the hopes of creating some distance from its
      erstwhile bus line while still providing a connection to the ten
      subsidiaries, such as Greyhound Exhibit group, that continued to carry the
      Greyhound name. The distinction was lost on the public, however, as people
      continued to call the corporate switchboard with bus route and fare
      questions. Less than a year later, in February 1991, the company adopted a
      less confusing name: The Dial Corp.
    

      Teets undertook a further restructuring of Dial in 1992, creating a
      spinoff company—GFC Financial Corp. later taking the name of Finova
      Capital Corp.—composed of Greyhound Financial Corp., Greyhound
      European Financial Group, and Verex Corp. The result was that a lot of
      hidden value was unlocked in these assets and Finova enjoyed strong
      growth, prompting investors to clamor for even more streamlining in Dial,
      convinced there was additional unrealized wealth in the remaining assets,
      split between consumer products and service companies. Unlike Finova, Dial
      was only able to achieve growth through further acquisitions.
    

      Teets resisted the idea of further divestiture until 1996 when Michael
      Price of Heine Securities began accumulating a significant stake in Dial,
      which for years had been trading in the $20 range but had an estimated
      breakup value around $40. In a proactive move Teets announced that Dial
      would be split into two publicly held companies, with consumer products
      and the service assets going their separate ways. The consumer products
      side kept the Dial name, while the service companies inherited the
      corporate entity that was once Greyhound Corp. and took a new name, Viad
      Corp. It also retained Teets as chairman and CEO, if only for a brief
      period. He announced plans to retire at the start of 1997 while at the
      same time naming his handpicked successor, Robert H. Bohannon, the
      51-year-old head of the Travelers Express subsidiary. Bohannon also
      brought 17 years of experience at General Electric's financial
      unit.
    

      After the split-up was completed in 1996, Viad consisted of companies
      involved in airline catering through Dobbs International Service; airplane
      fueling and ground-handling through Aircraft Service International;
      convention and exhibit services through GES Exposition Services and
      Exhibitgroup/Giltspur; contract foodservices through Restaura, Inc.;
      airport and cruise ship duty-free concessions through Greyhound Leisure
      Services; travel services through Brewster Transport, Jetsave, and Crystal
      Holidays; and payment services through Travelers Express. The best of the
      group were Travelers Express, GES Exposition, and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur,
      all of which were major players in their fields and enjoying strong
      growth.
    


        Company Perspectives:
      


          Viad (pronounced VEE-ahd) is an S&P SmallCap 600 Company
          comprised of businesses that provide high-quality services that
          address the needs of trade show organizers and exhibitors, as well as
          travel and recreation services in the United States and Canada.
        



      Upon taking over for Teets, Bohannon began to refine Viad's
      business mix, shedding some assets while adding others. In 1998 Viad cast
      off Aircraft Services International Group and the duty-free business, then
      a year later sold Restaura and Dobbs
       International Services. During this period, the company bolstered
      Travelers Express with the $50 million acquisition of Game Financial
      Corporation, providing patrons of casinos and other gaming establishments
      with cash through credit card advance and check cashing services, and
      automated teller machines. In June 1998 Travelers Express paid $287
      million to acquire MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc., a nonbank provider of
      consumer wire-transfer services, which complemented Travelers
      Express's money order business.
    

      Exhibitgroup/Giltspur also grew externally, acquiring Dimension Works in
      November 1998, just one in a series of acquisitions that commenced before
      the creation of Viad Corp. and resulted in the largest exhibition company
      in the world. Headed by Charles Corsentino, the Dial subsidiary
      Exhibitgroup began its growth spurt in 1995 with the acquisition of its
      top competitor, Giltspur, with both companies generating about $130
      million in annual sales. In addition, in 1995, the company added All West
      Display and Displaymasters & Deaton. The acquisition of Color
      & Design Exhibits followed in July 1996, then in 1998 T.L. Horton,
      Germany's Volbo Innenausbau, and Dimension Works were brought into
      the fold of the world's largest full-service exhibition company,
      maintaining offices in 17 cities in the United States as well as Toronto,
      Canada, and Dusseldorf, Germany.
    

      By the new century Viad was involved in two primary areas: payment
      services and convention and event services. Revenues totaled more than
      $1.57 billion in 1999, yielding net income of $347.5 million. Both
      business segments enjoyed solid growth in 2000, a 16 percent increase for
      payment services and 11 percent for convention and event services.
      However, events outside the company's control intervened in 2001
      and adversely affected Viad's fortunes. While payment services
      added nearly $100 million in sales for the year, convention and event
      services experienced a 14.3 percent drop in revenues due to a sagging
      economy, which caused some convention customers to forgo building new
      exhibits, and the terrorist attacks of September 11, leading to travel
      concerns and the cancellation of some trade shows and exhibit orders.
    

      Difficult conditions continued in 2002, as Viad's total revenues
      decreased 2.1 percent to $1.62 billion and net income slipped to $57.9
      million. Again, payment services held steady, increasing revenues by 9.5
      percent, but the convention and event services' sales declined by
      another 11.1 percent. In 2003 payment services was adversely impacted by
      lower interest rates and widespread mortgage refinancing that resulted in
      the segment growing at a modest 3.6 percent clip. Convention and event
      services lost another 8.8 percent in sales, although it was able to
      produce profitable results in spite of a shrinking marketplace for trade
      shows and conventions.
    

      It had become clear to investors and management alike that Viad's
      two principal business segments were hardly capable of achieving synergy.
      As had been true during the Greyhound and Dial days, the assets were
      building up unrealized value that could hopefully be unlocked by splitting
      the two segments into separate companies. In 2003 Viad began the process
      of engineering a reverse tax-free spinoff of the payment services unit.
      Thus, a new subsidiary was formed, MoneyGram International, Inc., which
      early in 2004 received the payment services business and its stock was
      distributed to Viad stockholders. Viad then conducted a one-for-four
      reverse stock split to increase the price of Viad shares. For the year,
      continuing operations generated $785.7 million in revenues. The company
      that had once been involved in buses, meat, soap, and money orders was now
      focused almost entirely on the trade show and convention business. Given
      its size and breadth there was every reason to expect that with a
      rebounding economy, Viad was well positioned to enjoy success in its
      chosen field.

  Viad Corp (NYSE: VVI) today announced second quarter 2017 net income attributable to Viad of $27.9 million, or $1.37 per share, and income before other items of $24.9 million*, or $1.22 per share*. These results exceeded the company's prior guidance primarily driven by stronger than expected revenue growth of 12.3 percent and solid execution at both business units.                            Q2  2017               Q2  2016                y-o-y  Change     $ in millions, except per share data                                             Revenue             $   364.8         $   324.7         12.3   %     Organic Revenue*               350.9           321.5         9.1   %                                       Net Income Attributable to Viad             $   27.9         $   19.5         43.3   %     Income Before Other Items*               24.9           21.1         17.9   %     Income Before Other Items per Share*               1.22           1.04         17.3   %                                       Adjusted Segment Operating Income*             $    40.5         $   34.8          16.4   %     Adjusted Segment EBITDA*               55.0           44.9          22.4   %                                         Revenue of $364.8 million increased 12.3% ($40.0 million) year-over-year, or 9.1% ($29.4 million) on an organic basis (which excludes the impact of acquisitions and exchange rate variances).     The organic revenue growth primarily reflects strong underlying growth at both business units and positive show rotation at GES.   The acquisitions of ON Services (August 2016), FlyOver Canada (December 2016) and the Poken event visitor engagement technology (March 2017) contributed incremental revenue of $19.7 million.   Exchange rate variances had an unfavorable impact on revenue of $9.1 million.     Adjusted segment operating income, adjusted segment EBITDA and income before other items improved compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the increase in revenue.    Steve Moster, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Viad delivered another quarter of strong results that exceeded our prior guidance as positive business momentum at both GES and Pursuit carried into the second quarter. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic growth initiatives and favorable industry trends. Our teams executed well during the quarter and did an excellent job converting the increased revenue into profitable growth. Our income per share came in $0.23 above the high end of our prior guidance range and adjusted segment EBITDA margins improved by 130 basis points year-over-year."

However, we want you to know that the tracking technology we use does not identify any personal information about you. Such technology cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. We only know who you are if you tell us. You may, however, be asked to provide personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or email address to us when you register for online goods and/or services.
Cookies: One way we track activity is by using cookies. A “cookie” is an electronic file that holds small strings of text. When you visit our website, we send a cookie to your browser so that we can recognize it when you or another user of your computer return to our website. We want to recognize your browser so we can make the best use of your time when visiting our website.  For your security, if you are registered for online services and/or have an account with us, we cannot give you access to your account information on our website unless your browser is set to accept cookies from us.
Advertising: When you visit our website by clicking on certain banner ads or special offers on a partner’s website, we track this information to improve navigation and so we can deliver relevant information to you when you arrive at our website. We also do this because we want to determine if our ads and special offers are appealing to our users. In the course of serving our ads to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to learn which ads we place on third-party sites bring users to our website. They do not capture or convey any personal or sensitive information about you.
Browser settings: You can adjust many browser preferences so that you are alerted when a cookie is placed in your browser, or adjust preferences to decline cookies altogether. Cookies enable you to visit our website without reviewing introductory information. In addition to allowing us to recognize you, cookies also enable us to securely provide our registered users with account information.
We will maintain information about you, your assigned account, online account activity, online goods and/or services requested and your usage of our website to help us administer your online account needs and to continually improve your online experience by providing you with customized and relevant information and offers.
We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe that personal information may have been collected about such child, please see How We Use The Information We Collect and Your Opt-Out Choices, below.
How We Use Your Email Address for Online Accounts:
We recognize that email can be the preferred mode of communication for some of our website users. If you provide us with your email address when registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account online, we will use it to contact you about online goods and/or services for which you have registered or about your account.
We may use your email address to send you the following types of email messages:

Service notifications related to your accounts(s)
Products or services information
Promotional offers or updates about our goods and/or services
Email newsletters related to us and our business activities

We do not share your email address with non-affiliated companies for them to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you.
Ads That Link To Our Website:
We may use third parties to place banner ads on other websites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use of ad servers. We do not provide ad servers with your personal information and ad servers do not collect your personal information.
Ad servers are subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about the privacy policies of these ad servers including information on how to opt-out of their tracking methods, please click  here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative website.
How We Safeguard Your Information:
We realize how important security is to you, so we’ve taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information sent to, or from, us over the Internet.
First, we require that a “secure session” be established. This is done any time you supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas. This technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and our systems can understand, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser support TLS 1.2 or newer for communications security over internet connections.  Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.
Second, many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access.
Third, in order to bring you the many online goods and/or services offered through our websites, we work with carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any personal information with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure these vendors and non-affiliated companies protect this information, which may include requiring they complete questionnaires and/or taking other evaluative measures of their information and security systems, safeguards, and practices prior to selection as a business partner. These measures may also include implementing contractual provisions to ensure the security and confidentiality of your customer information. In some cases, we may also audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.
Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from our website or an email from us may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Policy. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy policy of other Internet sites you visit.
When you have finished using a secure area of our website, make sure you always click on the “Log Out” link where and when it appears on the top of every secure page. When you click on it, no further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. This also helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from your computer.
You should be aware that browser software often “caches” a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer’s temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your “Back” button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else viewing your confidential information.
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
Your Opt-Out Choices:
We provide users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving email communications from us at any time. If for any reason you would like to unsubscribe from our communications, please follow the instructions below:

Simply click the Unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every email you receive.
Send us an email at info@viad.com with the word “Unsubscribe” in the subject line. To opt out of receiving offers or email newsletters from other companies, follow the instructions provided by those companies.

Please be advised that although the withdrawal of your consent will be respected and processed immediately, it is possible you may receive promotional material that had already been scheduled prior to receipt of your withdrawal.
EU-US Privacy Shield For Non-U.S. Users:
We are a global company and have facilities and affiliated companies throughout the world. Please note that we may collect, store and process your personal information in the United States or in other countries outside of the country where you live. The United States and/or these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection for your personal information as is offered in the country in which you live. To address privacy concerns, we comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  We hereby certify that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. We will use our reasonable best efforts to maintain the security of your personal information, provide opt-in/opt-out notices where personal information is collected as required, use data in a manner consistent with its original purpose for collection, and offer mechanisms for you to assist in ensuring your personal information is accurate and reliable.  In the event that we transfer your personal information or any other data regulated by Privacy Shield to a third party, we could be liable for any damages resulting from violations of applicable law arising from such onward transfer, provided that we were responsible for the event giving rise to such damage.
You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information, and you may also limit our use or disclosure of your personal information, provided that you send us notice of any such request in an email to info@viad.com or by mail to:

We may be required, and therefore reserve the right, to share your personal information in response to lawful information requests from governmental authorities or as otherwise required by law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Today no industry can exist without the assistance of the service industry. It has become an essential part of our everyday life. Service industry generally thrives on the needs of the people. The most important factor in the services is of the quality and the delivery time used by the service providers. As the economy of many nations in todays date chugs on the growth of the service sector as it is contributing a substantial part to the GDP of a nation, hence it is a vital worldwide business prospect.
