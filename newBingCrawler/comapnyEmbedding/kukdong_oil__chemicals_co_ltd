Company Introduction
KDOC have been devoting ourselves to the development of construction materials with a spirit of craftmanship seeking after best quality since established in 1987.
We produced modified bitumen membrane in the early 1980's first in our country, when built-up roofing system was widespread in the field of waterproofing material.
And we have been leading the industry in terms of the quality improvement as well as customer protection by setting up 'Q'mark, a Korean quality guaranty standard, when there was no quality standard here.
Now, we can produce the best quality of waterproofing membrane with the newest automatic prodution facilities from Germany based on accumulated know-how of bitumen modification for more than 15 years.
We extend our business to housing construction in 1995.
Further more, we promise you that we will be more reliable company trying our best from material development to construction. 
KUKDONG OIL & CHEMICAL CO., LTD.(KDOC), since its foundation, has been a fore-runner in the Korean lubricant industry, developing and distributing specialized lubricant products. KDOC has substantially contributed toward raising the quality of domestic lubricant products such as premium grade liquid paraffins and paraffin waxes developed with its own technology.
 KDOC, through its continuing investment in research and development and through its successful business expansion efforts, has established a strong foundation - public offering of its stocks - and works hard to face the challenge of the 21st century.
In addition, KDOC does its best toward overall development through acquisition of the high quality labor force, expansion of domestic and international distribution networks, stringent quality control, and utmost technical service.
