OAO Slavneft-YaNOS

OAO Slavneft-YaNOS (YaNOS) is the Company’s largest refinery with the design capacity of 15.0 MTA. Over the last 15 years, the Refinery has been operating with the maximum utilization rate.

YaNOS manufactures more than 100 types of products, including high-quality eco-friendly motor gasoline, diesel oil, jet fuel, lube oils, bitumen (road, roofing, and construction bitumen), paraffins and waxes, aromatic hydrocarbons, furnace fuel, and etc. Many of these products are among the Russia’s top 100 goods. Slavneft-YaNOS was awarded the Prize of the Russian Federation Government for great achievements in enhancement of the product quality and introduction of the effective management methods.

The Refinery is one of the industry leaders in manufacturing of fuels compliant with the up-to-date European standards. Due to the ISO 9001:2000 certified quality management system, YaNOS can continuously improve production technologies and consumer properties of petroleum products. Since the late 1990s, YaNOS has been implementing a large-scale upgrading and revamping program, simultaneously increasing the operations safety and decreasing the adverse impact on the environment. During this period, more than two tens of major refining facilities were revamped and built; thus, a high-end advanced oil processing plant, consisting of hydro-cracking, visbreaking and catalytic reforming (with continuous catalyst regeneration) units, was constructed.

In 2005, YaNOS became the first Russian refinery to master production of Premium Euro-95 gasoline and diesel oil with the sulfur content of 50 ppm. In 2006, the Refinery launched a new product line – eco-friendly EN 590 diesel oil with the ultra-low sulfur content of 10 ppm. In 2011, YaNOS completed construction of the Izomalk С5-С6 Fraction Isomerization Unit and Cat-Cracked Gasoline Hydrotreatment Unit. Commissioning of these industrial facilities enabled the Refinery to fully convert to production of motor gasoline and commercial diesel oil under the Euro-5 environmental standard in 2012.

In 2013, the Refinery launched the Diesel Oil Hydrotreatment Unit with the capacity of 1.6 MTA and Oil Sludge Recycling Unit with the capacity of 5-12 cubic meters per hour within the YaNOS upgrading program. In 2014, the Refinery revamped the Gasoline Pool Units (1A-1M Catalytic Cracking Unit, MTBE Production Unit and Sulfuric Acid Alkylation Unit) for increasing the production of high-octane motor gasoline and introduced the diesel oil dewaxing technology for improving the cold flow properties of winter fuel.

In 2015, upgrading of the C-500 Section of the KM-2 Lubes and Waxes Production Plant was completed at YaNOS. The Automated Station for Diesel Fuel and Kerosene Single-Point Loading into rail tank cars was put into operation; construction and installation works of the Group III Base Oils Production Complex were commenced. This new Complex will make possible for the Refinery to manufacture synthetic oils, which will be equals or betters to the foreign ones by quality.

In 2016, YaNOS launched the on-spot station of residual fuel loading into rail tank cars designed for loading of 5.3 mln tons of the product per annum. Thus, the Refinery completed the large-scale revamping of the loading system, which had been started in 2005. The out-of-date gallery-type racks were replaced by the new Stations that allowed the Enterprise increasing the accuracy of petroleum products loading and minimizing the environmental risks.

Slavneft’s structure includes two refineries, OAO Slavneft-YaNOS (Yaroslavl region, Russian Federation) and OAO Mozyr Refinery (Republic of Belarus).

OAO Slavneft-YaNOS is the largest refinery in Central Russia with a capacity allowing to process more than 15 MTA of crude hydrocarbons. With its developed production and transportation infrastructure, YaNOS ranks fourth in terms of crude hydrocarbons refining among the Russian refineries. The Enterprise’s share in the total volume of oil processed in Russia makes 5.3%.

The range of YaNOS products includes over 100 types, many of which are entered into the list of the Russia’s top 100 goods. In 2009, the Refinery was awarded the Russian Federation Government Prize for great achievements in products quality enhancement.

Since the late 1990s, YaNOS has been implementing a large-scale upgrading program. Over the past years, more than 20 major industrial facilities were built and revamped at the Refinery. Particularly, an up-to-date advanced oil processing plant, consisting of hydro-cracking, visbreaking and catalytic reforming units, was constructed.

In recent years, due to step-by-step upgrading of the industrial facilities, YaNOS managed to significantly increase an oil processing depth and light products yield. In 2012, YaNOS became one of the first Russian refineries, which fully converted to production of gasolines and diesel oil under the Euro-5 environmental standard.

The Mozyr Refinery is located in the Gomel region, in the south of the Republic of Belarus. Traditional sales markets of the Refinery are the northern regions of Ukraine, the western regions of Russia, the southern regions of Belorussia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Petroleum products are supplied to the markets of East European countries through the system of product pipelines. Mozyr Refinery’s products are always of an exceptional quality; they are characterized by the low content of sulfur compounds in jet fuel and diesel oil, a high calorific value of residual fuel and no tetraethyl lead in motor gasoline. In 2015, the Refinery was awarded the Republic of Belarus Government Prize for Quality for the fourth time in its history.

Within implementation of the Mozyr Refinery Development Program, the existing processing units are upgraded and new facilities are constructed. Over the past years, the Enterprise put into operation the Catalytic Cracking and Benzene Production Plants, Tar Visbreaking Unit, Cat-Cracked Gasoline Hydrodesulfurization Unit, Diesel Oil Hydrotreatment Unit, Alkylation Unit, Isomerization Unit, Residual Fuel Vacuum Distillation Unit, Combined Plant for Production of Gasoline High-Octane Components, and other industrial facilities.

Petroleum products of Slavneft’s Refineries are sold both in Russia and abroad. Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, the Company’s shareholders, export these products and sell them at domestic markets of Russia and the Republic of Belarus.

15/06/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 15/06/2017 21:03
YaNOS put into operation Group III Base Oils Production unit








        15.06.2017
      

        OAO Slavneft-YaNOS (part of OAO NGK Slavneft, a joint enterprise of PJSC Gazprom Neft and PJSC Rosneft Oil Company) put into operation Group III Base Oils Production Unit.
      

        The plant with a capacity of 100 thousand tons per year is designed for the production of four types of high-tech base oils, two of which have not been previously produced in Russia. The launch of this unit will allow to replace up to 40% of imported products in the domestic market, which is used for production of high-quality synthetic motor oils.
      

        Construction of the unit was started in 2015. Investments in the project amounted to 5.5 billion rubles. The new unit is included in the production chain of the enterprise - the feed comes from YaNOS Hydrocracking unit.
      

        Group III base oils are the basis for obtaining modern commercial oils, in demand in various areas - from vehicles to large enterprises. The advantages of this product are high viscosity, low content of sulfur, nitrogen, excellent low temperature properties. One of the promising areas of group III base oils use is the production of a special fraction used as a basis for drilling fluids, a significant proportion of which is imported today from abroad.
        
ОАО Slavneft-Yaroslavnefteorgsintez (ОАО Slavneft-YaNOS) is the largest refinery in the Northern region of Russia (part of OAO NGK Slavneft, a joint enterprise of PJSC Gazprom Neft and PJSC Rosneft Oil Company).
          The processing capacity of the plant is about 15 million tons of oil per year. The product range of the plant includes motor gasoline and diesel fuel of Euro-5 standard, aviation kerosene and jet fuel, a wide range of oils, bitumen, paraffin wax products, aromatic hydrocarbons, liquefied gases and fuel oil.
          YaNOS was the first among Russian refineries to master the production of premium motor fuel Euro-95 and diesel fuel with a sulfur content of 50 ppm (Euro-4 level). Since July 1, 2012 YaNOS has completely switched to the production of all motor fuels (motor fuel and diesel fuel) of the Euro-5 standard.

YANOS refinery commissions new Group III-quality base oil production facility








        A new facility for production of Group III-quality base oils has been commissioned at the JSC Slavneft-YANOS refinery, part of OAO NGK Slavneft, a joint enterprise between Gazprom Neft PJSC and Rosneft.
      

[Attachment]


        The facility, which has a capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year, is designed to produce four kinds of high-technology base oils, two of which have not, hitherto, been produced in Russia. The commissioning of this facility will allow the replacement of up to 40 percent of products currently imported for the production of high-performance motor oils on the domestic market.
      

[Attachment]


        Construction of the facility commenced in 2015. Total investment in the project stands at RUB5.5 billion. The new facility forms part of the plant's production chain, with crude for the facility being supplied from the YANOS hydrocracking unit.
      

        Group III base oils are the basis for the production of modern commercial oils, in demand from various sectors, from vehicular transport to major enterprises. The advantages of this product are its high viscosity, low sulphur and nitrogen content, and excellent performance at low temperatures. A promising area for the use of Group III base oils lies in the production of a special fraction used as the basis for drilling muds, a significant proportion of which is currently imported from abroad.
      

Petr Degtyarev, Director of Gazprom Neft's Oil Refining Directorate, commented: 'The development of the domestic oil refining industry is currently ahead of the curve. We are continually modernising production capacity and implementing ambitious plans that will result in the domestic market being supplied with high-quality Russian-produced petroleum products. Starting production of Group III base oils at the YANOS refinery will not only allow the implementation of a lubricants import substitution programme, but will also give additional impetus to the development of new products in demand from Russian consumers'.
      


          JSC Slavneft-Yaroslavnefteorgsintez (Slavneft-YANOS), part of OAO NGK Slavneft, a joint enterprise between Gazprom Neft PJSC and Rosneft, is the most important oil refining facility in Northern Russia.
        

          The facility's total refining volumes stand at approximately 15 million tonnes of oil per year. Its products include motor gasolines and Euro-5 diesel fuels, aviation fuels, and a wide range of oils, paraffin and wax products, aromatic hydrocarbons, LPG and fuel oil (mazut).
        

          YANOS was the first Russian refinery to produce premium Euro-5 gasolines and diesel fuels with sulphur content below 50 ppm (the Euro-4 standard). YANOS transferred to full production of Euro-5 motor fuels (automobile gasolines and diesel fuels) on 1 July 2012.

The shareholders and managers of ОАО NGK Slavneft repeatedly stated that they considered it possible to sell OAO Slavneft-Yaroslavl Mendeleyev Refinery only to a reliable, socially responsible buyer able to ensure its further development. Within preparation for the transaction with OAO NGK Slavneft, ZАО NEFTGAZSBYT signed the Agreement with the Yaroslavl Government, under which it is liable to upgrade and utilize the Refinery’s capacities, and continue implementation of the social and environmental programs.
ОАО Slavneft-Yaroslavl Mendeleyev Refinery was established in 1879. Its capacities allow processing up to 500 ths tons of hydrocarbons per annum and manufacturing approximately 50 different products, including oil fuels, motor gasoline, gear, fuel, industrial, non-fluid, burner oils, coolants, oil additives, plastisol, and arctic fuels.

        OAO Slavneft-YaNOS (part of OAO NGK Slavneft, a joint enterprise of PJSC Gazprom Neft and PJSC Rosneft Oil Company) put into operation Group III Base Oils Production Unit.
      

        The plant with a capacity of 100 thousand tons per year is designed for the production of four types of high-tech base oils, two of which have not been previously produced in Russia. The launch of this unit will allow to replace up to 40% of imported products in the domestic market, which is used for production of high-quality synthetic motor oils.
      

        Construction of the unit was started in 2015. Investments in the project amounted to 5.5 billion rubles. The new unit is included in the production chain of the enterprise - the feed comes from YaNOS Hydrocracking unit.
      

        Group III base oils are the basis for obtaining modern commercial oils, in demand in various areas - from vehicles to large enterprises. The advantages of this product are high viscosity, low content of sulfur, nitrogen, excellent low temperature properties. One of the promising areas of group III base oils use is the production of a special fraction used as a basis for drilling fluids, a significant proportion of which is imported today from abroad.
        
ОАО Slavneft-Yaroslavnefteorgsintez (ОАО Slavneft-YaNOS) is the largest refinery in the Northern region of Russia (part of OAO NGK Slavneft, a joint enterprise of PJSC Gazprom Neft and PJSC Rosneft Oil Company).
          The processing capacity of the plant is about 15 million tons of oil per year. The product range of the plant includes motor gasoline and diesel fuel of Euro-5 standard, aviation kerosene and jet fuel, a wide range of oils, bitumen, paraffin wax products, aromatic hydrocarbons, liquefied gases and fuel oil.
          YaNOS was the first among Russian refineries to master the production of premium motor fuel Euro-95 and diesel fuel with a sulfur content of 50 ppm (Euro-4 level). Since July 1, 2012 YaNOS has completely switched to the production of all motor fuels (motor fuel and diesel fuel) of the Euro-5 standard.
