      Notes to Editors:
    

      Hydrodec's technology is a proven, highly eﬃcient, oil re‐reﬁning and chemical process ini ally targeted at the mul ‐billion US$ market for transformer oil used by the world's electricity industry. MarketsandMarkets forecasts that the global transformer oil market is expected to grow from US$1.98 billion in 2015 to US$2.79 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 7.14% from 2015 to 2020. Spent oil is currently processed at two commercial plants with dis nct compe ve advantage delivered through very high recoveries (near 100%), producing 'as new' high quality oils at compe ve cost and without environmentally harmful emissions. The process also completely eliminates PCBs, a toxic addi ve banned under interna onal regula ons. Hydrodec's plants are located at Canton, Ohio, US and Bomen, New South Wales, Australia.
    

      Hydrodec's shares are listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange. For further informa on, please visit www.hydrodec.com.

      Chief Execu ve's Report
    

      A er a par cularly diﬃcult 2015 for the Company, I am pleased to be able to report signiﬁcant progress in delivering the Company's key objec ves during the period under review, achieved against a challenging, yet improving, market backdrop.
    

      Strategy
    

      At the me of my appointment as CEO and the divestment of the UK recycling opera ons in March 2016, the Board restated its strategy to concentrate on the Group's market leading transformer oil re‐reﬁning technology and business and to grow that business to access an increasing propor on of the US$2 billion plus global transformer oil market. Speciﬁcally, the Board stated its inten on, as the Company moves forward through 2016, to look to strengthen Hydrodec's footprint in the US and in the interna onal transformer oil market, where the Board believes Hydrodec has a compe ve advantage through its proven and market‐leading technology.
    

      In line with this strategy, my focus has been to grow the transformer oil business in order to drive proﬁtability, with a rigorous focus on execu on when deploying our market leading transformer oil re‐reﬁning technology, making eﬀec ve costs savings and delivering the ramp‐up of produc on and sales in the US.

      Opera onal review
    

      − USA
    

      The main drivers in 2016 have been to refocus on the core transformer oil re‐reﬁning technology by op mising the performance of the Canton facility, and to increase produc on levels through a combina on of leveraging the experience gained since fully commissioning the plant at the end of last year along with speciﬁc targeted opera ng improvements, building on lessons learned during the commissioning process. These improvements have been validated by the signiﬁcantly lower number of produc on hours lost through unscheduled stoppages and the record monthly produc on performance of the plant in May of 2.82 million litres of SUPERFINE transformer oil and base oil. Plant u lisa on increased over the period, from an average of 64% in Q1 to 70% in Q2 with a peak of 76% in May and has averaged 68% through Q3 to date.
    

      These developments have supported total sales volumes in Canton in the period of 15.5 million litres. An addi onal primary objec ve relates to improving the sales mix between higher margin transformer oil and lower margin base oil produced at the Canton plant. At the beginning of the year, January transformer oil sales represented 19% of US volumes sold. Since then signiﬁcant improvements have been made in this area and in June transformer oil represented 71% of sales, with further advances targeted. Growth in transformer oil sales have been supported by the SUPERFINE product achieving "500 hour" oil status, cer fying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and a prerequisite to accessing the larger power transformer market.
    

      Post period‐end, in September, we announced that the American Carbon Registry ("ACR") had approved Hydrodec's patented technology as a carbon oﬀset project in the voluntary carbon oﬀset market, allowing the Company to generate, and mone se, carbon credits. Hydrodec of North America ("HoNA") is now genera ng oﬀsets through the re‐reﬁning of used transformer oil, which would otherwise ordinarily be incinerated or disposed of in an unsustainable manner. The ACR has recognised 165,000 credits for HoNA's previous produc on between 2009 and 2014 and the Company an cipates that it will generate 50,000 to 60,000 tons of carbon oﬀset annually going forward. Whilst the historical credits may only generate nominal sums through trading, the ongoing genera on of such credits could realise up to US$5 per ton (source: Carbonomics).
    



          Australia
        

          In respect of the opera ons in Australia, since the commissioning of the plant at the Southern Oil Reﬁnery in May 2015 we have had to work hard to re‐establish our commercial posi on in the market. Total sales volumes in Australia for the period were 1.3 million. In May, the Australian business enjoyed one of its highest feedstock acquisi on months since 2012 and since then has consistently sourced feedstock at an op mal level to maximise its proﬁtability going forward. The focus is now on expanding the customer base and increasing the propor on of transformer oil sales.
        

          Post period‐end, in August, we announced the award of a 5 year contract to supply SUPERFINE transformer oil to Essen al Energy, a major Australian u lity. The contract includes the collec on and re‐reﬁning of all their PCB and non‐PCB waste oils and is expected to generate over 1 million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract. The contract was awarded under a compe ve tender process, with the Company successfully compe ng against a range of new oil suppliers.
        



          Market background
        



      In the US, leading producers of naphthenic speciality products, of which Hydrodec is one, have experienced lower margins due to high value inventory and lagging market prices from the impact of the ﬁrst quarter crude price fall. Whilst the Group has been successful in improving margins since the ﬁrst quarter, the Board expects margins to remain challenging for the second half of the year before improving into 2017, driven by improving product prices which lag recent increases in crude prices.
    

      In Australia, market demand and margin remain rela vely stable and the key to margin and volume improvement will be based around leveraging the award of the Essen al Energy contract to increase sales of transformer oil into the key u li es.
    

      Financial review
    

      Revenues from con nuing opera ons increased 148% to US$8.1 million (H1 2015: US$3.3 million), reﬂec ng the full commissioning of the Canton plant at the end of last year. The Group sold 16.8 million litres during the period, an increase of 217% on the corresponding period in 2015 which had included 3.6 million litres of traded oil whilst the US business was being recommissioned. Of the volumes sold in the period, 40% represented transformer oil and 60% was base oil, with margins steadily improving since the beginning of the year.
    

      There has been a key focus on the reduc on of overheads and corporate costs. Signiﬁcant reduc ons have already been realised with the expecta on that the beneﬁts from more recently implemented ini a ves will ﬁlter through in H2. These savings are reﬂected in the reduc on in administra ve expenses from con nuing opera ons from US$6.1 million to US$3.9 million as highlighted below.

      Group EBITDA from con nuing opera ons improved from US$3.4 million loss (H1 2015) to US$1.1 million loss. The total loss for the period (including discon nued opera ons) was US$5.3 million (H1 2015: US$8.4 million).
    

      Opera ng cash ou low (before working capital movements) reduced to US$2.0 million (H1 2015: US$5.8 million). The improved EBITDA performance resulted in lower working capital ou lows which reduced from $3.0 million to $2.4 million. Total net cash expended in the ﬁrst six months of 2016 was US$0.2 million compared to a US$12.6 million ou low in the prior year comparable period. Overall, the Group held US$0.6 million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the period and retained approximately US$1.4 million headroom under its working capital facili es provided by Andrew Black, a Director and the Company's largest shareholder.
    

      Disposal of UK recycling opera ons
    

      In late 2015 and January 2016, the Company undertook a detailed strategic review of its UK waste oil collec ons business and proposed UK lubricant oil re‐reﬁning project, following a signiﬁcant deteriora on in its UK opera ons. This deteriora on was driven predominately by the rapid decline in global oil prices and con nued challenging market condi ons which resulted in the UK business genera ng an increasing level of signiﬁcant losses. Despite implemen ng extensive restructuring and cost‐saving measures during 2015, Hydrodec remained exposed to the impact of the global oil price decline. Given the signiﬁcant cash consump on and limited cash resources available to the Company (in the absence of a signiﬁcant further fundraising), the Directors
    

      reviewed all available op ons and concluded that it was in the best interests of the Company to dispose of the UK opera ons.
    

      Following a strategic auc on process conducted by an independent third party ﬁnancial adviser, the Company sold its UK opera ons to Andrew Black, a non‐execu ve Director and substan al shareholder (the "Buyer"), on 4 March 2016 for a considera on of £1 in cash, including the transfer to the Buyer of c. £1.2 million of exis ng third party indebtedness in the UK business and involving the injec on by the Buyer of further working capital into that opera on. In addi on, the Buyer granted Hydrodec a contractual right to receive a propor on of the Buyer's en tlement to any future proﬁts of the UK re‐reﬁning project on the following waterfall basis (a) ﬁrst, the Buyer, as primary risk taker, to recover the costs of its investment in the UK re‐reﬁning project; (b) then, the next tranche to be applied 70:30 between Hydrodec and the Buyer respec vely un l Hydrodec has recovered its costs incurred to date in connec on with the UK re‐reﬁning project; and (c) ﬁnally, the balance of any proﬁts to be shared 90:10 between the Buyer and Hydrodec. The Buyer will bear all risk and responsibility for developing the UK lubricant oil re‐reﬁning project going forward, with Hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these proﬁt share arrangements. The UK re‐reﬁning project also oﬀers a poten al opportunity to develop transformer oil re‐reﬁning capacity in the UK. The impact on the Company of all of the above is described in note 12 to the interim ﬁnancial statements.
    

      Risk management process
    

      The Group has policies, processes and systems in place to help iden fy, evaluate and manage risks at all levels throughout the organisa on. Risks are regularly reviewed and monitored by business unit or func onal management teams. The execu ve team review the major risks across the Group on a quarterly basis to ensure that the management of these risks has appropriate focus. The Board review these at least twice a year.
    

The principal risks that could poten ally have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group in the future are set out on pages 12 and 13 of the 2015 Annual Report. The con nued successful opera on of Canton is the key performance impera ve for the Group. The Annual Report can be downloaded at www.hydrodec.com


      Outlook
    

      Today's results conﬁrm signiﬁcant progress in the turnaround of the Company over the ﬁrst half of the year. Our key objec ve during the rest of the year is to strengthen margins as we grow market share and seek to leverage the recent carbon credit approval in the US, whilst con nuing the program of cost reduc on. Volumes and margins in Q3 to date remain consistent with Q2 and, with both opera ons now genera ng posi ve EBITDA, we con nue to make strong progress towards posi ve Group EBITDA in the second half of the year.

      Long Term U lity Contract Awarded
    

      The Company is pleased to report that its Australian opera on has been awarded a 5 year contract for the supply of inhibited transformer and switchgear oil by Essen al Energy, a major Australian u lity. The contract includes the collec on and re‐reﬁning of all generated PCB and non‐PCB waste oils and is expected to generate over 1 million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract. The contract was awarded under a compe ve tender process, with the Company successfully compe ng against a range of new oil suppliers. Under this contract, Hydrodec will become the sole supplier of new inhibited transformer and switchgear oil to Essen al Energy. The Company expects to start supplying oil under the new contract from September 2016.
    

      Commen ng on this success, Chris Ellis, Chief Execu ve Oﬃcer of Hydrodec said "I am hugely encouraged by this contract award as it is a signiﬁcant milestone in the evolu on of the Company's ac vi es. Although it will only make a modest contribu on at the Group level, it is a very signiﬁcant contract both locally and strategically. We are delighted that our re‐reﬁned transformer oil was successful in a compe ve tender and exceeded the technical product acceptance criteria. It is further evidence of the quality of our product and provides the basis to develop similar rela onships with other u li es in Australia and elsewhere."

Chief Executive's Report
 
After a particularly difficult 2015 for the Company, I am pleased to be able to report significant progress in delivering the Company's key objectives during the period under review, achieved against a challenging, yet improving, market backdrop.
 
Strategy
 
At the time of my appointment as CEO and the divestment of the UK recycling operations in March 2016, the Board restated its strategy to concentrate on the Group's market leading transformer oil re-refining technology and business and to grow that business to access an increasing proportion of the US$2 billion plus global transformer oil market. Specifically, the Board stated its intention, as the Company moves forward through 2016, to look to strengthen Hydrodec's footprint in the US and in the international transformer oil market, where the Board believes Hydrodec has a competitive advantage through its proven and market‐leading technology.
 
In line with this strategy, my focus has been to grow the transformer oil business in order to drive profitability, with a rigorous focus on execution when deploying our market leading transformer oil re-refining technology, making effective costs savings and delivering the ramp-up of production and sales in the US.

Operational review
 
-      USA
 
The main drivers in 2016 have been to refocus on the core transformer oil re-refining technology by optimising the performance of the Canton facility, and to increase production levels through a combination of leveraging the experience gained since fully commissioning the plant at the end of last year along with specific targeted operating improvements, building on lessons learned during the commissioning process. These improvements have been validated by the significantly lower number of production hours lost through unscheduled stoppages and the record monthly production performance of the plant in May of 2.82 million litres of SUPERFINE transformer oil and base oil.  Plant utilisation increased over the period, from an average of 64% in Q1 to 70% in Q2 with a peak of 76% in May and has averaged 68% through Q3 to date. 
 
These developments have supported total sales volumes in Canton in the period of 15.5 million litres. An additional primary objective relates to improving the sales mix between higher margin transformer oil and lower margin base oil produced at the Canton plant. At the beginning of the year, January transformer oil sales represented 19% of US volumes sold. Since then significant improvements have been made in this area and in June transformer oil represented 71% of sales, with further advances targeted. Growth in transformer oil sales have been supported by the SUPERFINE product achieving "500 hour" oil status, certifying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and a prerequisite to accessing the larger power transformer market.
 
Post period-end, in September, we announced that the American Carbon Registry ("ACR") had approved Hydrodec's patented technology as a carbon offset project in the voluntary carbon offset market, allowing the Company to generate, and monetise, carbon credits.  Hydrodec of North America ("HoNA") is now generating offsets through the re-refining of used transformer oil, which would otherwise ordinarily be incinerated or disposed of in an unsustainable manner. The ACR has recognised 165,000 credits for HoNA's previous production between 2009 and 2014 and the Company anticipates that it will generate 50,000 to 60,000 tons of carbon offset annually going forward. Whilst the historical credits may only generate nominal sums through trading, the ongoing generation of such credits could realise up to US$5 per ton (source: Carbonomics).
 
-      Australia
 
In respect of the operations in Australia, since the commissioning of the plant at the Southern Oil Refinery in May 2015 we have had to work hard to re-establish our commercial position in the market. Total sales volumes in Australia for the period were 1.3 million.  In May, the Australian business enjoyed one of its highest feedstock acquisition months since 2012 and since then has consistently sourced feedstock at an optimal level to maximise its profitability going forward.  The focus is now on expanding the customer base and increasing the proportion of transformer oil sales.  
 
Post period-end, in August, we announced the award of a 5 year contract to supply SUPERFINE transformer oil to Essential Energy, a major Australian utility.  The contract includes the collection and re-refining of all their PCB and non-PCB waste oils and is expected to generate over 1 million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract. The contract was awarded under a competitive tender process, with the Company successfully competing against a range of new oil suppliers.  
 
-      Market background
 
In the US, leading producers of naphthenic speciality products, of which Hydrodec is one, have experienced lower margins due to high value inventory and lagging market prices from the impact of the first quarter crude price fall. Whilst the Group has been successful in improving margins since the first quarter, the Board expects margins to remain challenging for the second half of the year before improving into 2017, driven by improving product prices which lag recent increases in crude prices.  
 
In Australia, market demand and margin remain relatively stable and the key to margin and volume improvement will be based around leveraging the award of the Essential Energy contract to increase sales of transformer oil into the key utilities.
 
 
Financial review
 
Revenues from continuing operations increased 148% to US$8.1 million (H1 2015: US$3.3 million), reflecting the full commissioning of the Canton plant at the end of last year.  The Group sold 16.8 million litres during the period, an increase of 217% on the corresponding period in 2015 which had included 3.6 million litres of traded oil whilst the US business was being recommissioned. Of the volumes sold in the period, 40% represented transformer oil and 60% was base oil, with margins steadily improving since the beginning of the year.
 
There has been a key focus on the reduction of overheads and corporate costs. Significant reductions have already been realised with the expectation that the benefits from more recently implemented initiatives will filter through in H2.  These savings are reflected in the reduction in administrative expenses from continuing operations from US$6.1 million to US$3.9 million as highlighted below.

Group EBITDA from continuing operations improved from US$3.4 million loss (H1 2015) to US$1.1 million loss.  The total loss for the period (including discontinued operations) was US$5.3 million (H1 2015: US$8.4 million). 
Operating cash outflow (before working capital movements) reduced to US$2.0 million (H1 2015: US$5.8 million).  The improved EBITDA performance resulted in lower working capital outflows which reduced from $3.0 million to $2.4 million. Total net cash expended in the first six months of 2016 was US$0.2 million compared to a US$12.6 million outflow in the prior year comparable period. Overall, the Group held US$0.6 million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the period and retained approximately US$1.4 million headroom under its working capital facilities provided by Andrew Black, a Director and the Company's largest shareholder.  
 
Disposal of UK recycling operations
 
In late 2015 and January 2016, the Company undertook a detailed strategic review of its UK waste oil collections business and proposed UK lubricant oil re-refining project, following a significant deterioration in its UK operations. This deterioration was driven predominately by the rapid decline in global oil prices and continued challenging market conditions which resulted in the UK business generating an increasing level of significant losses. Despite implementing extensive restructuring and cost-saving measures during 2015, Hydrodec remained exposed to the impact of the global oil price decline. Given the significant cash consumption and limited cash resources available to the Company (in the absence of a significant further fundraising), the Directors reviewed all available options and concluded that it was in the best interests of the Company to dispose of the UK operations. 
 
Following a strategic auction process conducted by an independent third party financial adviser, the Company sold its UK operations to Andrew Black, a non-executive Director and substantial shareholder (the "Buyer"), on 4 March 2016 for a consideration of £1 in cash, including the transfer to the Buyer of c. £1.2 million of existing third party indebtedness in the UK business and involving the injection by the Buyer of further working capital into that operation. In addition, the Buyer granted Hydrodec a contractual right to receive a proportion of the Buyer's entitlement to any future profits of the UK re-refining project on the following waterfall basis (a) first, the Buyer, as primary risk taker, to recover the costs of its investment in the UK re-refining project; (b) then, the next tranche to be applied 70:30 between Hydrodec and the Buyer respectively until Hydrodec has recovered its costs incurred to date in connection with the UK re-refining project; and (c) finally, the balance of any profits to be shared 90:10 between the Buyer and Hydrodec. The Buyer will bear all risk and responsibility for developing the UK lubricant oil re-refining project going forward, with Hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these profit share arrangements. The UK re-refining project also offers a potential opportunity to develop transformer oil re-refining capacity in the UK. The impact on the Company of all of the above is described in note 12 to the interim financial statements.
 
Risk management process
 
The Group has policies, processes and systems in place to help identify, evaluate and manage risks at all levels throughout the organisation. Risks are regularly reviewed and monitored by business unit or functional management teams. The executive team review the major risks across the Group on a quarterly basis to ensure that the management of these risks has appropriate focus. The Board review these at least twice a year.
 
The principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact on the Group in the future are set out on pages 12 and 13 of the 2015 Annual Report. The continued successful operation of Canton is the key performance imperative for the Group.  The Annual Report can be downloaded at www.hydrodec.com  
 
Outlook
 
Today's results confirm significant progress in the turnaround of the Company over the first half of the year.  Our key objective during the rest of the year is to strengthen margins as we grow market share and seek to leverage the recent carbon credit approval in the US, whilst continuing the program of cost reduction. Volumes and margins in Q3 to date remain consistent with Q2 and, with both operations now generating positive EBITDA, we continue to make strong progress towards positive Group EBITDA in the second half of the year.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM REPORT
1.     BASIS OF PREPARATION
Hydrodec Group plc is the Group's ultimate parent company.  It is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.  The address of Hydrodec Group plc's registered office is 6 Hay's Lane, London, United Kingdom.  Hydrodec Group plc's shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group presents its financial statements in US dollars, as the Group's business is influenced by pricing in international commodity markets which are primarily dollar based.
These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors on 15 September 2016.
The interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016, which are unaudited, do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. Accordingly, this condensed report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015, which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and any public announcements made by the Group during the interim reporting period.
The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been reported on by the Group's auditors, received an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the registrar of companies at Companies House. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been drawn up using accounting policies and presentation expected to be adopted in the Group's full financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, which are not expected to be significantly different to those set out in note 1 to the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
 
2.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Restatement of prior period balances
In preparing the six months ended 30 June 2016 financial statements, certain balances in respect of prior period (six months ended 30 June 2015) have been restated. 
·      The retranslation of certain reserve accounts has been reversed so as to present the reserve accounts at their historical position as at 1 January 2014. It has not been possible to restate back to the original opening position but any impact is within reserves and deemed immaterial.
·      In the Statement of Comprehensive Income, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations and capital contribution from non-controlling interests have been restated to show the reclassification of capital contribution of US$325,000 from non-controlling interests from other comprehensive income to transactions with owners. This has subsequently changed the figure for exchange differences from US$(417,000) to US$(399,000).
·      In the Statement of Financial Position, the carrying amount of the intangibles relating to the CEP license has been restated to reflect the US$953,000 write-off in the six months ended 30 June 2015 with the offset reflected in trade and other payables. This restatement has no impact to profit and loss. 
·      In finalising the fair value of assets acquired with the purchase of Eco-Oil for the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, the Directors had reviewed the estimates of fair value made initially and recorded on a provisional basis in the Group's interim accounts for the six months ended 30 June 2015. Consequently, the reassessed figures for intangible assets were determined to have no material value assigned at the date of acquisition. This was further supported by the subsequent sales.  
Certain other balances in respect of prior periods (six months ended 30 June 2015 and year ended 31 December 2015) have been restated without any overall impact on net assets. 
·      Presentation of Income Statement to show reclassification between continuing operations and discontinued operations.

Mineral oil is used as an insulator in electricity transformers, capacitors and switching equipment and independent estimates put the value of transformer oil used worldwide at more than $50 billion. In Australia and overseas, a large proportion of the transformer oils in service are contaminated with various levels of toxic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds. These were used as insulating oils in the 1960s and 1970s because of their enhanced thermal, fire safety and stability properties. This old oil represents a major liability within the electricity industry.
The Hydrodec process developed by CSIRO is the only one available that can simultaneously decontaminate transformer oil and also regenerate its electrical properties to a quality as good as, if not superior to, the original product. Hydrodec (hydrodechlorination) is not just a solution for transformer oils and PCBs. It is capable of treating a broad range of persistent organic pollutants including dioxins, pesticides, herbicides and petrochemical waste and can be applied to advanced processes for the production of aluminium and magnesium metals, which produce toxic waste.
The Hydrodec Development Corporation Pty Ltd, was specifically formed to commercialise the technology for application worldwide and listed on the London Stock Exchange as the Hydrodec Group PLC in 2004. Beginning with a 20 000 litre/day plant in regional New South Wales, Hydrodec Group entered the US market in late 2008 with the commissioning of a 100 000 litre/day plant in Ohio. They plan to enter the Japanese and European markets by 2012.
Background
Mineral oil is used as an insulator in electricity transformers, capacitors and switching equipment. The Australian electricity generating and distribution system contains transformer oil valued at $600 million, and independent estimates put the value of transformer oil used worldwide at more than $50 billion.
In the 1960s and 1970s toxic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds were used as insulating oils in the electricity industry because of their enhanced thermal, fire safety and stability properties. PCBs were later found to be toxic and subsequently banned in the late 1970s. In Australia and overseas, a large proportion of the transformer oils in service are contaminated with various levels of PCBs, much of it largely as a result of cross contamination across the network. This can represent a significant hazard and precludes normal treatment and/or disposal.
The old oil represents a major liability within the electricity industry. Recycling this oil provides significant economic savings, avoids potential environmental problems and could eliminate the need for transformer oil imports and the costs associated with the disposal of the used product.

Regenerating transformer oils
In 1993, CSIRO Energy Technology began its collaboration with TransGrid (the authority responsible for the NSW high voltage electricity network), on the development of a process that regenerates the electrical properties of transformer oils and destroys toxic PCB compounds, without producing any noxious emissions. The process was later registered under the name ‘Hydrodec’.
The Hydrodec research partnership addressed several main issues:

the need for generating authorities and operators of electricity distribution networks to more effectively maintain the value of the transformer oil inventories within their networks
the high cost of handling and disposal of transformer oils contaminated with PCBs
achieving the objective of treating both contaminated and non-contaminated oils in a single process to produce a clean product with electrical properties restored to an ‘as new’ condition
avoiding the generation of noxious wastes in the treatment process which might just replace one environmental problem with another.

The project’s primary objectives were:

to develop a new, highly effective and economic process that can, in a single pass, destroy PCBs in degraded transformer oils without having a deleterious impact on the composition of the product
to simultaneously restore the electrical properties of degraded transformer oils to a condition equivalent to or better than the original so they can be returned to service
to ensure the process could achieve oil yields in excess of 99%
to develop a modular and compact process that could be skid-mounted to facilitate relocation between sites
to demonstrate the suitability of the process for destroying a wide range of toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons, including dioxins, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pentachlorophenol (PCP).

What is the Hydrodec process?
To eliminate contaminants the transformer oil is reacted with hydrogen over a catalyst, removing the oxygenated and chlorinated species that degrade the electrical properties of the oil. The Hydrodec process restores the electrical properties of the oil to an ‘as new’ condition while destroying any chlorinated hydrocarbons present. Through this unique refining technology degraded transformer oils previously regarded as waste can be fully and safely recovered.

Who was involved?
The early development of the Hydrodec process was carried out by scientists from CSIRO Energy Technology (in particular Dr Chris Fookes) in collaboration with personnel from TransGrid, (chiefly Dr Frances Mitchell and Mr Sen Peric). This work was supported through a Generic Technology Grant from the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. More recently there have been on-going collaborations with the technology licensee, Hydrodec Development Corporation Pty Ltd, to scale up the process to a viable commercial technology.
Environmental and economic benefits
Traditional methods for reconditioning transformer oils are unsuitable for PCB contaminated oils as they produce a contaminated waste that presents another disposal issue. The Hydrodec process is extremely effective in the destruction of PCBs, reducing feed concentrations as high as 1 000 ppm to levels below the detection limit of about 10 parts per billion.
In addition, traditional processes cannot produce oil that has electrical properties comparable with Hydrodec Superfine® transformer oil, a product with superior oxidation stability and high performance characteristics and with specifications equivalent to that of new transformer oil. Not only is the Hydrodec process very effective at restoring the dielectric properties of the oil, it achieves oil yields in excess of 99%.
Implementation of the Hydrodec system translates to significant cost savings in transformer asset management as treated oil can be returned to service and disposal costs are avoided. It also means less crude oil needs to be imported and refined, therefore reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with oil production as well as disposal of the product where it is simply burnt as a fuel oil.
Other applications
Hydrodec is not just a solution for transformer oils and PCBs, it has been proven capable of treating a broad range of persistent organic pollutants including dioxins, pesticides, herbicides and petrochemical waste. High temperature incineration has been a widely used method for disposing of such toxic wastes overseas. However, potential formation of dioxins during this process is the single most important factor raised in public opposition to incineration as a solution to toxic waste destruction in Australia. The chemical process developed by the CSIRO team solves this problem in a very ingenious way. Process conditions make the formation of dioxins totally impossible and our research has shown the Hydrodec process can destroy such chlorinated toxic materials with single pass decontamination factors >99.99999%.
The CSIRO technology can also be applied to advanced processes for the production of aluminium and magnesium metals, which produce toxic waste and for which there has so far been no viable treatment option. When combined with thermal desorption processes our work has shown that Hydrodec could also be used for the treatment of contaminated soils.
Hydrodec’s commercialisation
The Hydrodec process and equipment are fully patented and have been exclusively licensed to the Hydrodec Development Corporation Pty Ltd, (now Hydrodec Group PLC) a company specifically formed to commercialise the technology for application worldwide and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2004.
A 20 000 litre/day commercial scale module (scaled up from the 1 000 litres per day pilot plant operated at CSIRO’s Lucas Heights location), is now fully operational in regional New South Wales, processing transformer oil from Australian power utilities. In late 2008 Hydrodec Development Corporation entered the US market with the commissioning of a 100 000 litre/day plant in Ohio with another plant of similar capacity in the planning stage. The US market will be followed by the Japanese and European markets over the coming two to four years.
Beyond its implications for transformer oils the Hydrodec Development Corporation is looking to apply the process to the disposal of a large range of hazardous chlorinated chemicals and wastes without creating toxic by-products or hazardous emissions. This is potentially a very lucrative market.
In June 2008 CSIRO assisted Hydrodec Development Corporation to streamline their operating cash outflows, with the intention of making themselves more attractive to future investors as they move into global expansion, by converting its future royalty stream to a lump sum payment of A$5.6 million.
