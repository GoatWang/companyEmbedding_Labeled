        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

Shell customers will be able to pay for their fuel using Orange Money.Pan-African partnership covers nine countries (Botswana, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Senegal and Tunisia) where both companies overlap and where Orange Money is available


Under this agreement, Orange Money customers will be allowed to cash in and cash out money from their Orange Money account and pay in any Shell service station operated by Vivo Energy.The services - already available in Mali, Cote d’Ivoire and Madagascar - will be extended to the rest of the common footprint by mid-2017. This agreement was made in an effort to strengthen both companies’ footprints and to improve customers’ experience by offering them more convenience. Orange Money customers will have access to a network of over 1,000 Shell service stations to transact from. On the other hand, Vivo Energy customers will enjoy the trusted and secured services offered by the Orange Money platform. They will also save time and money on their payment transactions.Commenting on the partnership David Mureithi, Executive Vice President at Vivo Energy, said: “Mobile money represents a huge opportunity in Africa. Mobile Money services have gained momentum in a number of countries across the continent, led by operators, like Orange, looking to add to their portfolio value-added services. This initiative fits our overall strategy of offering innovating solutions, a convenient experience to our customers and develop a lasting relationship with them. Through this alliance with Orange Money, we want to expand the range of services we offer to our customers and also allow them to pay in a simple and easy way on our retail sites.”For Thierry Millet, Executive Vice President in charge of mobile financial services at Orange Group:, “Orange Money has evolved well beyond money transfer to cover from now on all the essential transactions that our customers perform every day. It has become a decisive financial inclusion tool on the continent. Together with Vivo Energy, through this multi-country partnership, we significantly increase the number of merchants that accept mobile money transactions. This is a real gain of proximity for our shared customers that can pay in a fast and secure way, and cash in and cash out from any Vivo Energy outlet”.

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Vivo Energy – 2nd phase of Africa transaction completes 
Today Vitol, Helios Investment Partners (Helios) and Shell have completed the second phase of the transaction that was first announced on February 19th 2011. Vitol and Helios have acquired the majority of Shell’s shareholding in their businesses in Cote D’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Guinea as well as the service company Africa Downstream Oil Products (ADOP), the employing company for those Vivo Energy staff who are based in South Africa. These companies will now become part of Vivo Energy, joining the seven companies that transferred to Vivo Energy on December 1st last year. These were Cape Verde, Mauritius, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia.
The final 4 countries that are included in this transaction will transfer to Vivo Energy later in the year, subject to local regulatory and legal approvals. These countries are Egypt, Kenya, Uganda and Ghana.
On final completion of this transaction Vivo Energy will operate more than 1300 retail stations across Africa under the Shell brand and will have access to around 1.2 million cubic metres of storage. Shell and Vivo Lubricants will have blending capacity at plants in eight countries, producing Shell branded lubricants, with the opportunity to market across Africa.
Vitol and Helios each own 40% of Vivo Energy, with Shell holding the remaining 20%. Shell and Vivo Lubricants is 50% owned by Shell and 50% owned by Vitol and Helios.

Since December last year, we have made good progress in creating a unique business for our customers in Africa. A business with ambitious plans to invest and grow, under the leadership of our country teams and the world class Shell Brand. This is an exciting time for Vivo Energy and the four new companies that have joined today will make a significant contribution to our future”.
