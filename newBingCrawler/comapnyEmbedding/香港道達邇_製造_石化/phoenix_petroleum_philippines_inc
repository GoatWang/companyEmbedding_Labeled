History[edit]
Phoenix is a home-grown company in Davao City. It was originally incorporated in May 8, 2002 as Oilink Mindanao Distribution, Inc., and changed its name in January 2004 to Davao Oil Terminal Services Corporation (DOTSCO). The small family business began operations in its current form thereon, distributing petroleum products to various commercial entities in Mindanao. Its first big account was Cebu Pacific. As the airline’s exclusive logistics partner since 2004, the oil company provides Cebu Pacific’s refueling requirements in all its Mindanao destinations.
In 2006, the company was renamed Phoenix Petroleum Philippines, Inc. and introduced lubricants and car care products to its product line.
It became a publicly-listed company in July 11, 2007, offering 25% of its total outstanding shares to the public. Phoenix Petroleum became the first independent oil company to be listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange after the Oil Deregulation Law was passed in 1998. Phoenix Petroleum also became the first company from Davao City to go public.
Phoenix received a certification for ISO 9001:2000 quality system standards for its Davao bulk plant and aviation fuel tank truck operations in 2008. In the same year, the oil company opened its first Manila station in Marikina and has jumped to rank 242 in the Philippines Top 10,000 Corporations in 2008 from being in rank 473 in 2007. [2] In 2011, it ranked 53rd.[3] Phoenix is the first petroleum company to introduce a toll-free number for franchising in 2009.
The Social Security System acquired up to 9.68 percent stake in Phoenix Petroleum in 2009, from its initial 2.78 percent. "We believe that with its track record and its positive business prospects, our addition of Phoenix Petroleum to the SSS' list of investments was a good decision," says SSS President Romulo Neri.[4]
World boxing champion Manny Pacquiao owns the 100th Phoenix station in General Santos City.[5]
In 2012, Phoenix is the seventh top importer in the country having remitted P4.7 billion in import taxes to the government. [6] Phoenix reportedly ended the first quarter of 2013 with 325 retail stations. [7] The revenue of Phoenix in the first quarter of 2013 increased from P8.3 billion last year to P10.3 billion this year. [8]
On February 1, 2013, Phoenix Petroleum signed a marketing partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) as the Official Petroleum Partner of the NBA in the Philippines. Phoenix Petroleum will be integrated into NBA media and events in the country, including NBA.com/Philippines and the Jr. NBA presented by Alaska, the league’s youth basketball development program. As part of the partnership, Phoenix Petroleum will also conduct NBA themed promotions in 300 service stations nationwide, giving fans in the provincial areas a chance to win exciting prizes and unique NBA experiences.[9][10]
It is also involved in the golf, as the Philippine Sports Commission commends Phoenix for having the long-term development program for golf in the country.
In 2016, Phoenix acquired the PBA franchise of Barako Bull Energy in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), aside from the participation in the PBA Developmental League.[11]

The park is now known as Phoenix Petroterminals & Industrial Park.[13]
The Board of Investments had also granted tax and fiscal incentives to Phoenix for its petroleum product facility in Zamboanga City, a P123-million project with a 4.9 million liter-storage facility for Phoenix petroleum products.[14] Phoenix has other depots in Davao City, Aklan, Surigao, Zamboanga, Batangas, and Cagayan De Oro.

Starting on the year 2010, there is an aggressive rise of revenues especially on the years 2010 and 2011. This is due to the 52% and 8.5% increase in sales volume of petroleum products and lubricants, respectively. However, there is a slight decline of 2% on its service revenue. The rise of the prices of petroleum products on 2012 caused a slight rise of revenues on that year. It is much better if prices will lower down as high prices can greatly affect the company’s revenues and profit as well.The company's cost and expenses are increasing which is not good for the company. As much as possible, companies tend to lower their cost so that they will gain a higher profit. But compared to the revenues, the cost and expenses are very near and even higher than the revenues which resulted to low and negative income. This tells that the company is incurring more cost and expenses than a positive income. Thus, this resulted to a negative impact to the company and lower profitability ratios particularly the profit margin.Net Profit of the company fluctuated from a very high profit to a negative profit and then a slight increase. This is due to high cost and expenses and lesser revenue. Even though the company has a great value on year 2009, the preceding years show a slow increase which is very alarming. It is not good at all. If this continues, the company will lose and they may not be able to declare and distribute dividends, investors might be discouraged and the company might not be able to support and sustain its business2.) Phoenix Petroleum will have to innovate their products and services that have a lower cost yet, a better quality to make something new in the industry; this will lead to higher operating margin and profit margin as well. Example of this is to emphasize the importance of safety and delivery of products. Another example is to replace or partially use other source of oil and gas like excreting oil from plants or other cheaper yet better sources.RecommendationThe group recommends the second alternative course of action. Since the company is profitable enough, the company has the capacity to spend a significant amount of money for research and development that can help in innovating new products and services that has lower costs. Through this, the company may attract customers and these new products and services that have lower costs may help the company recover from previous low profitability ratios and improve their sales and reduce cost of sales and other additional expenses.ConclusionThe group finally concludes that the company has to improve their sales to have a higher income and make new strategies to lower its costs and expenses. Thus, lead to higher profitability ratios and return to its investors and owners. SOLUTIONS...FIN...Used Phoenix's 2008-2013 Financial StatementsFull transcriptMore presentations by

About:
Incorporated in May 2002 in Davao City, Phoenix Petroleum Philippines, Inc. has grown from a simple family venture to one of the most successful businesses in Davao and the Southern Mindanao area. The company, then under the name Davao Oil Terminal Services Corporation (DOTSCO), began operations in its current form in January 2004, distributing petroleum products to various commercial entities in Mindanao. In August 2006, the company was officially renamed to Phoenix Petroleum Philippines, Inc. Today, Phoenix Petroleum is engaged in the business of trading refined petroleum products, lubricants and other chemical products, operation of oil depots and storage facilities, and allied services, mainly in Southern Philippines. Its products and services are distributed and marketed under the "Phoenix Fuels Life" trademark. In June 2005, Phoenix Petroleum opened its first retail service station. At end of 2007, the number of stations had grown to more than 50 in southern Mindanao. Phoenix ended 2008 with a total of 86 stations, with three in Luzon. Today Phoenix has more than 100 stations across the country. In February 2008, Phoenix received a certification for ISO 9001:2000 quality system standards for its Davao bulk plant and aviation fuel tank truck operations. In July 11, 2007, Phoenix Petroleum under the symbol PNX launched its initial public offering, becoming the first independent oil company to be listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange after the oil deregulation law was passed in 1998. Phoenix Petroleum also became the first company from Davao City to be listed in the stock exchange. In preparation for expansion into the Luzon market, Phoenix Petroleum bought out Bacnotan Industrial Park Corp. (BIPC) in 2009. BIPC is the operator of the Batangas Union Industrial Park (BUIP) located in Calaca, Batangas. Phoenix Petroleum's wholly owned subsidiary Petroterminals Philippines Inc. operates the Phoenix Petroterminals and Industrial Park.
