About Us
Named in honor of the
majestic Arabian Oryx (al Maha), the Al-Maha Petroleum Products
Marketing Company was established in 1993, by virtue of a
Royal Decree issued by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said.
Since that time, we have been
a strategic partner in the development and support of the
Sultanate's infrastructure. We maintain a network of service
stations throughout Oman. Through capital investment and growth, we
have developed services that reach the most inaccessible parts of
the Sultanate. From the heart of the Omani desert to the high
mountains, our service stations provide essential supplies that are
required by the nation and its citizens.
In addition, we provide vital
related activities, including:

Convenience stores
Auto services
Smart card services
Aircraft refueling

Throughout our history, we have
operated in a sustainable manner that respects the natural
environment, as befits our name. We work closely with the competent
authorities to ensure that our corporate activities do not harm the
environment. In addition, we provide environmentally-friendly
products and services to consumers.
We aim to build on this history of
innovation, reliability and sustainability to identify and deliver
the products and services that will benefit our customers and
shareholders in the future.
