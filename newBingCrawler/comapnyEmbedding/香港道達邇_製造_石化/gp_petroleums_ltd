FILE - In this April 18, 2012 file photo, a man walks past a Repsol gas station in Madrid. Repsol reports first quarter earnings results on Thursday, May 7, 2015.Photo/Paul White, File)MUMBAI: With an eye on doubling its lubricant business by the end of the decade, Repsol, the Spain's largest petroleum company has entered India by announcing a partnership with GP Petroleum Ltd, a UAE based Oil Company.GP Petroleum, which last year acquired SAH Petroleum in India is a modest player in the domestic industrial lubricant space with its IPOL brand through this partnership with Repsol wants to build its position in the thriving automotive lubricants market. Apart from manufacturing Repsol lubricants at its existing plants in Vasai and Daman, GP Petroleum is also planning to set up a separate 1,00,000 tonnes plant on the outskirts of Pipavav with an investment of Rs 125 crore, which will be commissioned in the next 9-12 months.The partners have set themselves a target of achieving 5% automotive lubricant market by the end of the decade and if GP-Repsol achieves that India will be the second largest lubricant market for Spanish lubricant maker with a production of 50,000 metric tonne in India.Carlos Pascual (International Manager Lubricants- Europe, Africa, Middle East & Asia Pacific) told ET India is a very complex market, and Repsol needed a strong partner who has the knowledge of the market and in GP Petroleum they found one."India is amongst the 10 biggest economies of the world, which is growing at a decent pace that means a lot of growth. We think that combination of good economic growth, the trend towards more sophisticated product, in terms of performance, environment aspect will allow us to play a role," added Pascual.GP petroleum will be securing the formulation of Repsol, blending on behalf of Repsol and marketing the Repsol brand in India. Repsol apart from helping GP in giving technology, formulation, it will also join hands with them in spending money for marketing this lubricant in the country. The spends will be shared 50:50 to start with. While Repsol is strong in two wheelers, it intends to offer products for all the segment of the automotive industry and challenging brands like Castrol, IndianOil amongst others.S Thangapandian, ED at Gulf Petrochem says there is a a good synergy between both the companies Repsol needed a partner, with a good strong presence in the country, the partner who has the financial strength and distribution strength."We already have a partnership with Repsol as traders, we are big traders out of UAE, we are a big trader for base oil, this relationship got extended to his partnership here," he said.Repsol currently has around 30 distributors, with warehouses across the country, which are marketing IPOL lubricant for both industrial and automotive segment. The company has more than 2000 dealer counters across the country, which will start selling Repsol lubricant starting September this year.Both the partners are open to JV or equity participation from Repsol in India in the future."We know that this relationship is a starting point, as things move forward, there are lot of things that we can do together. It is an initial phase, so first you start understanding each other, the culture, plus-minuses. I don't rule out anything. We have been both open about that, as we move forward, we will decide," added Thangapandian.While the global lubricant market is flat, the 2 million metric tonne Indian lubricant market is growing at 2.5-3%, and within that the automotive lubricant market, which makes up for 52% of the overall lubricant market is growing at 6%."We should be in top 20, but our plan is to double the size of the company from 2012-2020. India obviously plans a very important role in that in the lubricant space. That would put us in top 10 brands globally with an annual production of half million metric tonnes of lubricant oil," said Pascual.India will also be the feeder point for the SAARC region for GP-Repsol.
