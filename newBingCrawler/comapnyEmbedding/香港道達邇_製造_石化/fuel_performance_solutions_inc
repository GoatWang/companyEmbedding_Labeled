International Fuel Technology, Inc. (IFT) has developed a number of proprietary fuel additives and resulting fuel blends that significantly increase fuel economy and fuel lubricity, and reduce harmful emissions. Unlike traditional fuel additives, which are primarily derived from petroleum, IFT's proprietary technology is based entirely on surfactant chemistry, a complex mixture of detergent substances which, when blended into gasoline or distillates, positively alter the chemical make-up of the fuel, creating a fuel with a more complete and efficient burn with higher lubricity.    Business Description As an emerging leader in the fuel science industry, International Fuel Technology markets a series of multi-functional fuel additives proven to deliver impressive performance enhancements in a variety of market applications.   Our formulations effectively prolong engine life, keep fuel systems at peak cleanliness, reduce maintenance costs, reduce emissions, and deliver compelling fuel economy increases, helping our customers to effectively combat the rising cost of fuel. Equipped with our high-volume manufacturing capability, global distribution network, and world-class technical staff, IFT has embarked on a mission to bring these innovative products to companies all over the world.

Expanding Rail Progress to Belgium  The National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB) to Commence Field Validation Of DiesoLiFT(TM) 10  ST. LOUIS, Nov 17, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- International Fuel Technology, Inc. (IFT) (OTCBB:  IFUE) announced that it is making dramatic progress in opening up markets in both Western and Eastern Europe for its breakthrough diesel fuel additives. To date, the most significant commercialization successes have been in the U.K., where extensive laboratory testing and field usage have consistently demonstrated the fuel economy benefits provided by DiesoLiFT(TM) 10. Multiple sales orders for DiesoLiFT(TM)10 have already been filled. Sales to the U.K. rail market are expected to grow rapidly in the years ahead aided by the affiliation with Unipart Group, the U.K.'s premier distributor to the rail industry. The market for DiesoLiFT(TM) 10 in the U.K. rail industry alone is estimated at $15 million.   IFT's German-based distribution partner, Nordmann Rassmann's ("NRC"), is making significant progress with Eastern European-based rail operators. Among them, both Romanian rail operator Regiotrans SRL and Polish rail operator PKP LHS have commenced field validation programs using DiesoLiFT(TM) 10. Nordmann Rassmann has generated sales volumes this year and continues to develop a growing number of business opportunities. Now IFT is moving into Belgium. The National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to conduct a formal field validation process on their own equipment under their supervision. The testing is designed to confirm the fuel economy benefits of DiesoLiFT(TM) 10. SNCB (http://www.b-rail.be/main/) was founded in 1926 and is responsible for all of the rail operations, both passenger and freight, in Belgium. On an annual basis, SNCB handles over 200 million passengers and hauls approximately 60 million tons of freight. "The compelling conclusions from extensive laboratory and field testing completed in the U.K. have garnered the attention of rail operators and other major industry users of diesel fuel around the world," said Axel Farhi, IFT's Director of Global Business Development, "and we anticipate a continuation of the growing interest in our products." About International Fuel Technology, Inc. IFT is a fuel performance enhancement company focused on providing its technology to large, industrial consumers of diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel blends in the rail, stationary power generation and road transport industries. IFT has two primary product lines, DiesoLiFT(TM) 10 and the PerfoLiFT(TM)BD-Series. DiesoLiFT(TM) 10 is IFT's proprietary surfactant-based fuel additive formulation for use with diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel blends. The product has been scientifically proven to provide a significant improvement in fuel economy and a reduction in harmful emissions. In addition, DiesoLiFT(TM) 10 increases fuel lubricity, provides detergency benefits and co-solves normal amounts of free water, which collectively reduce maintenance costs for the end user. The product is easy to use, only splash blending is needed, and its use has been proven to have no effect on fuel composition, make-up or standard specification. The PerfoLiFT(TM) BD-Series is a series of fuel additive formulations specifically developed to provide superior oxidation stability and deposit formation control to bio-diesel and bio-diesel fuel blends.

("IFT") is a company that was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 9, 1996.  We have developed a family of fuel additive product formulations. These unique fuel blends have been created to improve fuel economy, enhance lubricity (reducing engine wear and tear) and lower harmful engine emissions, while decreasing reliance on petroleum-based fuels through the use of more efficient, alternative and renewable fuels.   We began transitioning from a development stage technology company to a commercial entity during 2002 and have been increasing our product marketing and sales efforts since.  We are now focused on continuing to develop the body of evidence of the efficacy of our products applicable to a wide range of markets and industries within these markets through additional industry specific laboratory testing and customer field-based demonstration trials.  In addition, we are continuing to strengthen our distributor and customer contact base.  Marketing and sales efforts, in conjunction with the additional industry specific testing, will complete our transition to a commercial enterprise.   The interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by IFT, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.   These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  We suggest that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the "2010 10-K").  We follow the same accounting policies in preparation of interim reports as we do in our annual reports.  We have evaluated subsequent events through November 14, 2011, the date these financial statements were issued.    Overview   We are a fuel performance enhancement technology company transitioning to a commercial enterprise. We believe the macro economic environment for our technology and products is excellent now and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.  We believe ever-increasing fuel environmental regulations will likely result in increased demand for additive products to help offset adverse fuel performance and engine impacts resulting from these regulations.  Our products and technology are uniquely positioned to benefit from this macro environment by offering fuel performance enhancement solutions that specifically address these macro developments and trends.   To date, our commercialization efforts have focused primarily on two proprietary products: DiesoLiFT  TM     10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM     BD-Series. DiesoLiFT  TM  10 was developed to increase fuel economy, reduce harmful emissions and reduce maintenance costs when mixed with diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel blends. The PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series was developed to address oxidation stability and deposit formation control issues associated with bio-diesel fuel use, both pure or in blends.   The potential market for DiesoLiFT  TM     10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series is massive. Virtually every gallon of diesel and bio-diesel fuel consumed in the world today is a potential market for IFT fuel additive technologies.   IFT's proprietary technology has been extensively tested and verified at a number of prominent independent test laboratories all over the world. IFT believes this separates it from most of the other fuel additive companies in the marketplace today.   For example, DiesoLiFT  TM     10 has been tested at the following independent test laboratories and has consistently demonstrated the ability to increase fuel economy, on average by 5%:        ·       mi Technology, United Kingdom;           ·     Southwest Research Institute, United States;           ·     Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada - FERIC;           ·     Motive Power, United States;           ·     Gerotek, South Africa;           ·     Prodrive Ltd, United Kingdom;           ·     Technological Institute for Development - LacTec, Brazil;           ·     Technological Research Institute (IPT) of São Paulo, Brazil;           ·     MTEC, Thailand; and           ·     Tsinghua University, China.        In addition,     numerous field trials all over the world have validated these independent laboratories' test results. DiesoLiFT  TM  10 has been tested in the field with road transport, rail and stationary power generation applications and has consistently demonstrated the ability to improve fuel economy, on average by 5%.   The PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series has been tested at the following independent test laboratories and has consistently demonstrated that it is the top performing fuel additive technology in the market today for addressing oxidation stability and deposit formation control in bio-diesel fuel blends:         12                  ·   BfB Laboratories, Belgium;           ·     National Institute of Technology - INT, Brazil; and           ·       Montana State University - Northern, United States.        Both products are easy to use. Once the additive is splash blended with a base fuel, the mixture forms into and remains a stable solution. Unlike traditional fuel additives, which are derived from petroleum, DiesoLiFT  TM  10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series are derived from a complex mixture of detergent substances (surfactant chemistry) that utilize, in part, naturally occurring fractions that are bio-degradable.   The manufacture of IFT's additive formulations is outsourced to Multisol (France) and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (U.S.). These relationships allow IFT to consistently deliver quantities of quality additive formulations on a timely basis.   The commercial goal of IFT is the bulk sale (by the ton) of DiesoLiFT  TM  10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series to the following major end-users of diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel blends:        ·     railroads;           ·     stationary power generation operators;           ·     centrally-fueled truck/bus fleets; and           ·     marine vessel operators.        IFT's primary strategy to achieve this goal is to outsource marketing and distribution by partnering with oil companies and prominent fuel additive distribution companies with existing customers and distribution channels. For example, IFT has distribution relationships with Multisol (France), Unipart Rail (U.K.), Caldic (U.K.), Nordmann Rassmann (Germany) and Tide Water Oil Co. (India).   We believe IFT has two of the top performing fuel additive technologies in the world today, DiesoLiFT  TM  10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series, that target markets where consumption is massive and growing and environmental concerns and pressures to reduce harmful emissions are real. A number of end-users and distribution partners are buying our products. In addition, we believe the time consuming process of tests and trials has generated opportunities that should produce additional revenue streams in the last quarter of 2011 and during 2012.   Recent Developments   Railroads   The Association of Train Operating Companies in the United Kingdom. ("ATOC") and the Rail Safety and Standards Board ("RSSB") under the independent management of world-renowned railroad consultant Interfleet Technology ("Interfleet") has been evaluating IFT's DiesoLiFT  TM  10 fuel additive since 2005.  Four rounds of extensive laboratory testing, using strict industry protocol, clearly demonstrated that use of DiesoLiFT  TM  10 not only improves fuel economy but also, and as important, has a measured effect improving engine performance and reducing carbon particulates.  In two of the laboratory tests, improvements in fuel economy of 6.9% and 5.9% were achieved. In three of the laboratory tests, a power increase ranging from 2%-3.5% was achieved.   Subsequently, a number of field-based demonstration trials with ATOC members have demonstrated that use of DiesoLiFT  TM  10 significantly improves fuel economy.  As part of the ATOC field evaluation, one ATOC member ran two extensive field-based demonstrations utilizing its entire fleet of light rail engines (approximately 90 units).  In both cases, use of DiesoLiFT  TM  10 demonstrated an approximate 4% improvement in fuel economy.       13             Commercial discussions with numerous ATOC members have been ongoing and one operator has already placed four purchase orders for DiesoLiFT  TM  10.  We expect numerous other ATOC members to place orders and begin using DiesoLiFT  TM  10 in the next three to six months.   In addition, due to our progress and success with ATOC, we are in discussions with numerous European rail operators and two of these operators have already commenced with DiesoLiFT  TM  usage in field validation programs.  We are also in the evaluation process with one of the largest rail operators in Brazil.   Distribution Partners        ·     Multisol: We signed a manufacturing, marketing and distribution agreement with Multisol in July 2008 providing Multisol with distribution rights to market and sell IFT's products in France, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. Multisol is selling our additive formulations to numerous accounts, including prominent fuel additive companies who are re-packaging the formulations for resale into retail markets.           ·     Unipart Rail: We signed a marketing and distribution agreement with Unipart in June 2011 providing Unipart with the rights to sell IFT's products to the U.K. rail market. Unipart and IFT have already had numerous joint meetings with prospective end-user accounts.           ·     Nordmann Rassmann ("Nordmann"): We signed a marketing and distribution agreement with Nordmann in August 2008 providing Nordmann with the right to market and sell IFT's products in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Poland, The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. Nordmann has introduced our products to numerous customers and made sales of the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series during the first three quarters of 2011 and during 2010.           ·     Caldic U.K. ("Caldic"): We signed a marketing and distribution agreement with Caldic in May 2008 providing Caldic with distribution rights to IFT's products in the United Kingdom. Caldic has introduced our products to numerous end-user customers and is in the process of running field-based demonstration trials with selected end-users.           ·     Tide Water Oil Co. India Ltd ("Tidewater"): Headquartered in India, Tidewater is a prominent manufacturer and distributor of additives and lubricants to the automotive and industrial markets.  Tidewater purchases and then re-packages DiesoLiFT  TM  10 for sale into these targeted markets in India: power generation set users; tractor operators; the agricultural industry; and retail distribution markets. Tidewater made several purchases of DiesoLiFT  TM  10 in 2010.        PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series   Extensive research, development, product validation testing and "no harm" testing has been completed. The PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series has clearly demonstrated that it is a top performing technology in the market.  Two products in the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series, PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-3 and PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-4, have received the coveted "No Harm & Relative Efficiency" certification from the AGQM under its renowned "No Harm and Efficiency" program. The Association for the Quality of Bio-diesel, or AGQM, is an independent German-based organization formed in 1999 to monitor the quality of bio-diesel. The product has already been approved for use by a number of bio-diesel producers around the world. IFT distribution partners have begun to market and sell the product in their respective territories.   In Brazil, IFT is currently engaged in product validation programs with Petrobras for PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-4 and with Bio Capital for PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-7.   In Europe, the worldwide economic downturn has negatively impacted the increase in production and end-user demand for bio-diesel, and therefore, the demand for new age antioxidant products like the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series.  We believe the proliferation of bio-diesel in Europe will continue to progress during the remainder of 2011     and, through our distribution partner network, most notably Nordmann, we are well-positioned to capitalize on current demand and the anticipated increase in demand.       14             United States Progress   Multiple fleets with over the road tractors and fleets of heavy-duty equipment have been purchasing and using DiesoLiFT  TM  10 for many years. For example, a large regional supermarket chain has been using DiesoLiFT  TM  10 in their entire fleet of road tractor-trailers for over four years and a regional construction and aggregate company has been using DiesoLiFT  TM  10 in their fleet of heavy-duty off road equipment for approximately two years.   Other Opportunities   Efforts to improve the performance of IFT fuel additive formulations are ongoing. IFT has partnered with prominent independent test laboratories, chemical companies, fuel additive distribution companies and oil companies to further the development of and enhance the performance of its products on a stand-alone basis, or as part of a fuel additive package.   Results of Operations   Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010   Revenues   Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2011 was $59,281, as compared to $5,301 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010.  This increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of DiesoLIFT  TM  10 to end-user customers ($35,852 increase for the comparable periods) and increased sales of the PerfoLIFT  TM  BD-Series primarily through our distributor network ($18,128 increase for the comparable periods).     Sales revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2011 was split between sales to end-user customers (70%) and distributors (30%).  Sales revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was split between sales to end-user customers (64%) and distributors (36%).  Sales revenue generated during the three months ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively, was primarily generated from the sale of DiesoLiFT  TM     10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series.   Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $167,785, as compared to $229,392 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010.  Sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was split between sales to end-user customers (56%) and distributors (44%).  Sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was split between sales to end-user customers (17%) and distributors (83%).  Sales revenue generated during the first nine months of 2011 and 2010 was primarily generated from the sale of DiesoLiFT  TM  10 and the PerfoLiFT  TM  BD-Series.

Services
Fuel  Efficiency  ManagementProgramThe Fuel Efficiency Management program: Fuel Performance Solutions has partnered with Unipart Rail to offer a unique, comprehensive fuel management system for all bulk end users of diesel fuel. The cornerstone of our Fuel Efficiency Management program is Fuel Performance Solutions’ flagship product - DiesoLiFTTM.
The Fuel Efficiency Management program addresses and mitigates the detrimental effects to fuel and equipment performance caused by increasing bio-diesel and ULSD use in the U.K. and Europe: water contamination, sludge and deposit formation, equipment failures, reduced fuel economy and power, and fuel stability and storage issues.
Adoption of the Program saves bulk consumers of diesel fuel money. The Fuel Efficiency Management program more than pays for itself due to the net fuel economy benefits provided by DiesoLiFTTMuse (end consumers expected Year 1 ROI ≥ 200%). 
								In addition, use of DiesoLiFTTM and adoption of the Program will: improve fuel quality, maintain fuel within specification, reduce equipment failures and downtime, reduce maintenance expenses, and reduce harmful emissions.
								Our Programs are sophisticated yet comprehensive value added service offers, developed to enhance the benefits of our fuel additives products and technology to end bulk consumers.
With our distributor and strategic partner Unipart Rail/Unipart Group we continue to innovate. Our pioneering, cost effective and environmentally sustainable Fuel Efficiency Management program is a prime example of our innovative spirit.

Our technologyMultifunctional:  In addition to increasing fuel economy, use of our products are proven to:

reduce emission
increase fuel lubricity
provide detergency
isolate normal amounts of free water
reduce microbial contamination
inhibit corrosion
increase fuel stability
reduce foaming.

The cumulative of the above will reduce maintenance expense and downtime.
Easy to use:  Only splash blending is necessary to mix the additive into a base fuel.  Both the DiesoLiFT™ Series and the PerfoLiFT™ BD-Series are easy to use.
Once splash blended into a base fuel, our products are uniformly incorporated into the base fuel.  The mixture forms into and remains a stable solution.
Fuel Composition:  Use of our products has been scientifically proven to have no effect on fuel composition, make up, or standard specification.
Safe: Our products are safe to handle; no harm to engine components and part.

Our solutionsOur Solutions are sophisticated yet comprehensive value added fuel efficiency and fuel additive management service offers.
With our distributor and strategic partner Unipart Rail/Unipart Group we have released our joint Fuel Efficiency Management program.
Learn More
How our technology worksUse of our unique technology creates a finer spray pattern of the fuel/air mixture in the combus-tion chamber. This atomization facilitates a more complete and efficient combustion. Therefore, less fuel is necessary for the same power output, reducing fuel consumption.
- more complete combustion = reduced emissions (less unburnt fuel)
- less fuel consumed per unit of work = less greenhouse gas emissions
Learn More
Tested and verifiedOur Fuel Performance Solutions’ technology has been extensively tested and verified at a number of prominent independent test labs all over the world.
In addition, numerous field demonstrations all over the world have validated independent lab test results.
Learn More
Our marketThe market for Fuel Performance Solutions and our products is virtually every gallon of diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel consumed in the world today.
Our current commercial focus and what make us different is the bulk sale (by the container) of DiesoLiFT™ and the PerfoLiFT™ BD-Series to major end users of diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel blends:

Railroad engines
Centrally-fueled truck/bus fleets
Stationary power generation operators
Marine vessel operators

Learn More
Fuel economyThe net economic benefit of the DiesoLiFT™ Series is compelling to the end user. For example, in the U.S., the net economic benefit (net savings) per gallon is approximately $0.10. In Europe, where fuel costs are higher, the net economic benefit (net savings) per gallon is approximately $0.22.
The manufacture of Fuel Performance Solutions’ additive formulations is outsourced to Brenntag's European division (Multisol Group in France) and its Latin America division (Brazil). These relationships allow Fuel Performance Solutions to consistently deliver quantities of quality additive formulations on a timely basis.
End users and bio-diesel producers are increasingly purchasing and using the DiesoLiFT™ Series and the PerfoLiFT™ BD-Series.

Fuel Performance Solutions, Inc. (PN) Description



Fuel Performance Solutions, Inc. (the "Company" or "FPS") provides fuel performance solutions to major end users of liquid hydro carbon fuels (diesel; bio-diesel; heating oil; gasoline; marine gas oil; and heavy fuel oil) in the rail, road transport (fleet operators), stationary power generation and marine industries.  Through its network of prominent distribution partners, which includes Unipart Group, Nordmann Rassmann and Brenntag, FPS has a number of (1) programs and (2) products that provide critical fuel system benefits to end users allowing them to: enhance the performance and life of their equipment; boost productivity; reduce downtime; and increase profitability.  Programs: For example, Unipart Group and FPS are in the process of launching the Fuel Efficiency Management ("FEM") Program in the U.K. within the rail and road transport markets, and in Europe within the rail market, to address the pressing needs that end users have with fuel quality, storage and performance. In the U.K. and Europe, the mandate to incorporate bio-diesel into the diesel fuel stream has created fuel storage and equipment performance problems. The use of bio-diesel does provide emissions benefits, but there are many drawbacks associated with bio-diesel use: it is not a stable fuel (it oxidizes and creates deposits); has a lower volumetric energy density than regular diesel (lower fuel economy and less power); naturally contains more water (fosters microbial contamination and sludge formation in tanks); causes corrosion and spray hole blockage of fuel injectors; causes seal failures; and causes fuel filter plugging. The comprehensive FEM Program offered by Unipart/FPS mitigates all risk associated with bio-diesel fuel use and provides the end user the ability to maximize the performance and efficiency of their equipment. The FEM Program consists of: fuel tank testing; fuel tank cleaning; fuel additive dosing equipment; using DiesoLiFT(TM) fuel additive formulation; and on-going fuel and fuel tank analysis and monitoring. The FEM Program ensures that end users are maintaining in-specification fuel and optimizing the performance of their equipment.  Products: The Company has a full slate of products that have been developed over a 10-year period through extensive laboratory testing (at world-renowned test facilities) and field validation trials. The products are fully vetted and their efficacy is irrefutable.  The Company's flagship product line, DiesoLiFT(TM), is a multi-functional technology that provides: increased fuel economy; increased fuel stability and storage benefits; increased fuel lubricity; engine and fuel system cleanliness; and reduced harmful emissions.  DiesoLiFT(TM) and a number of derivative products including FPS's PerfoLiFT line of fuel performance products are being sold by Brenntag on a stand-alone basis or as part of a fuel performance additive package to oil companies, refineries, fuel distributors and fuel additive retailers (e.g. Bardahl, Eurol and Lubrichim) to meet specific customer needs and wants. Brenntag has decided to roll out FPS's line of fuel performance products and packages as part of its newly released fuel additive strategy.  The Company's PerfoLiFT BD-series product line provides superior oxidation stability, fuel stability and deposit formation control to bio-diesel fuels of all underlying sources. Through distribution partner Nordmann Rassmann, many of the largest bio-diesel manufacturers in Europe are purchasing PerfoLiFT to stabilize their bio-diesel outputs.  Manufacturing: Manufacturing is outsourced to Brenntag's Multisol France division. This relationship ensures that FPS can deliver quantities of quality products on a timely basis. Multisol France, since being acquired by Brenntag in 2011, is also the "center of excellence" for the development of all of Brenntag's fuel additive and lube products.
