Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for.

Petróleos del Perú Seeks Financing/Partner
May 18 17
Petróleos del Perú - PETROPERÚ S.A. may recruit a partner to invest in the modernization of the Oleoducto Norperuano (ONP) pipeline. In doing so, Petroperu would avoid increasing its debt. Petroperu first plans to reactivate the pipeline, which has been paralyzed for over a year, before
focusing on modernization works. It has been confirmed that Petroperu is considering a partnership with Canadian oil firm Pacific in block 192. Pacific's exploration contract in the block has been extended by 18 months due to the paralysation of the ONP pipeline. As for the modernisation project of the Talara refinery, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has approved a bond issue of $2 billion out of the total $3 billion still needed to finance the project. The firm is still exploring its options to secure the remaining $1 billion.

State-owned Petroleos del Peru SA (Petroperu), through a contractor, has let a contract to Flowserve Corp., Irving, Tex., for the supply of pumping systems to be installed as part the long-planned modernization and upgrade of its 62,000-b/d Talara refinery at Piura, about 1,200 km north of Lima (OGJ Online, Dec. 19, 2013).
From its operations in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Lawrence, Mass., Flowserve’s engineered product division will provide the Talara refinery more than seven types of pumps as part of the order, which includes Flowserve’s proprietary horizontal overhung process pumps (OH2 and OH3) and horizontal between-bearing pumps (BB1, BB2, and BB3), the service company said on May 20.
Pump orders for the contract, which were booked during fourth-quarter 2014, amount to about $18 million, according to Flowserve.
This will be the first major pump installment at the Talara refinery since the 1970s, Flowserve said.
In 2014, Petroperu let a $2.7 billion lump-sum turnkey contract to Tecnicas Reunidas (TR) for upgrade and modernization of the refinery (OGJ Online, May, 29, 2014).
Slated to be completed within 55 months from the start of construction, the project is designed to equip the refinery to produce diesel and gasoline fuels conforming to new Peruvian environmental requirements of a maximum sulfur content of 50 ppm at competitive prices as well as increase the plant’s ability to process heavy crudes to improve operational flexibility.
TR’s scope of work will involve:
• The expansion and modification of existing process units, including the refinery's primary distillation unit, catalytic cracking complex, and vacuum distillation unit.
• The construction of processing units, which include a diesel hydrotreater, cracked naphtha and naphtha hydrotreaters, a vacuum distillation unit, flexicoker, naphtha catalytic reforming unit, amine unit, and cogeneration units.
• The expansion and upgrade of the utilities and off-sites installations.
Following completion of the $3.5 billion project, which previously was scheduled for 2017, crude oil processing capacity at Talara will rise to 95,000 b/d.
The project also will enable the refinery to have minimal emissions, generate its own electricity, and maintain on-site operations for desalination of seawater and purification to avoid altering aquifers in the area.
Construction status
Initial construction on the Talara modernization project began last year, but Petroperu plans to start building foundations for new units included as part of the upgrade during second-half 2015, German Velasquez Salazar, president of Petroperu, said earlier this month.
Work will include clearing areas for the new units as well as installing piles to support the new infrastructure, the company said.
While Petroperu continues to seek local workers to fulfill regional labor requirements as dictated by the environmental impact assessment as part of the project’s approval, to date, the project has achieved a completion rate of about 10%, Velasquez said.
