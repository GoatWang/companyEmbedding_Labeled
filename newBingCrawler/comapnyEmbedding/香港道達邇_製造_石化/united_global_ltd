Uniting Against Lung Cancer was established in 2001 as “Joan’s Legacy: The Joan Scarangello Foundation to Conquer Lung Cancer.” Named for a 47-year-old non-smoker, the foundation was created by her family and friends to continue Joan’s battle against lung cancer after she died. The Foundation assembled the nation’s most powerful committee of lung cancer clinical and research physicians to help create its Lung Cancer Research Grant Program. The organization funded its first $100,000 grants in November of 2003. As of 2010, over $7 Million has been funded through the Research Grant Program.
In 2004, the Foundation began partnering with other non profit organizations and individual families to allow them to fund individual research grants. New Partners join every year.
The first Kites for a Cure event was held in Southampton, NY on Memorial Day weekend in 2007 becoming one of our signature fundraising events. Since then families and groups across the country have embraced this beautiful and hopeful event to raise funds and awareness for lung cancer.
With a growing list of partners, Joan’s Legacy officially became Uniting Against Lung Cancer in 2009. This reflects the Foundation’s commitment to unite all families and organizations dedicated to conquering lung cancer. With the support of these like-minded groups we have funded 72 research grants in 22 states, making a huge impact in the fight against this disease. Together we will conquer lung cancer.
