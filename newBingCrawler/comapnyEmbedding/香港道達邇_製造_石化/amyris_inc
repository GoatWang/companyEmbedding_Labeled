Amyris is an integrated renewable products company providing sustainable alternatives to a broad range of petroleum-sourced products and rare materials. Amyris, in conjunction with various partners, is creating industrial scale supplies of vitamins, captive perfume molecules like Ambroxan, a patchouli substitute and Farnesene which can be used in tires, and lubricant, as well as their own beauty care product line using squalane, their substitute molecule for shark oil. Amyris uses its industrial synthetic biology platform to convert plant sugars into a variety of hydrocarbon molecules, flexible building blocks which can be used in a wide range of products. They do this by reengineering yeast so it can recreate complicated molecules. The time to market was reduced four fold after Amyris teamed with Darpa. Amyris is commercializing these products both as renewable ingredients in cosmetics, flavors, fragrances, polymers, lubricants and consumer products, and also as renewable diesel and jet fuels. Amyris Brasil S.A., a subsidiary of Amyris, oversees the establishment and expansion of Amyris’s production in Brazil. Amyris also has fuel distribution capabilities in the United States through its subsidiary, Amyris Fuels LLC. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Emeryville, Ca, Amyris has raised over $120 million in equity funding to-date, including investments from Royal DSM, Total S.A., Khosla Ventures, Votorantim Novos Negócios, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, TPG Biotech, and DAG Ventures as well as DARPA. Amyris is opening two more plants in New Zealand and Korea in proximity to sustainable sugar cane crops.
The company went public on NASDAQ in October 2010 (AMRS) but as of January 2013, was trading at less than 30% of its initial offering price due to lack of commercial success in cost-effectively producing "drop in" synthetic transportation fuel, which was to be its initial, major focus. The firm has now focused its attention on higher-priced and higher-margin products that are not in the transportation fuel area [1]

Renewable fuels[edit]
Amyris' technology platform, branded "No Compromise," is focused on providing high performance petroleum-alternatives, using sustainable feedstock such as sugarcane.
Amyris is establishing the partnerships and capabilities needed to bring the renewable diesel fuel to market. A few of these actions include:

distributing ethanol through a US subsidiary, Amyris Fuels, based in Chicago IL.
building a large scale production facility at Sao Martino, one of Brazil's largest ethanol producers
joint venture with Cosan, one of Brazil's largest ethanol distributors and marketers

Artemisinin[edit]
Artemisinin is a compound naturally found in the Chinese Sweet Wormwood plant effective in the treatment of malaria. Its production is hampered by difficult climate and agricultural conditions. Institute for OneWorld Health received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and produce non-seasonal, high-quality, affordable artemisinin, and engaged Amyris Biotechnologies and Sanofi to assist on certain parts of the project, which is near completion, based on technology from UC Berkeley, NRC Canada, and other sources.

It is pursuing arrangements with a number of drug companies for their use of its molecules to develop pharmaceutical products. For industrial applications, the Company's products include performance materials (such as solvents and polymers) and, with its joint venture partners, renewable lubricants and fuels. Its initial portfolio of commercial products has been based on Biofene and Biofene derivatives. In addition, it has produced at scale and commercialized over two target molecules for the F&F market. The Company markets its solvent product under the Myralene brand. The Company is developing applications for its farnesene that include high-performance polymers used in tires and other applications.

EMERYVILLE, Calif., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amyris, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMRS), the industrial bioscience company, today announces that it has entered into its first product development and production agreement with Koninklijke DSM N.V. (Royal DSM) (AEX:DSM.AS), the global science-based company active in health, nutrition and materials, to develop a food and nutrition molecule for which DSM is a major market provider. As part of the previously announced equity investment DSM is making into Amyris, DSM and Amyris have agreed to focus on a number of short- to medium-term product development & production opportunities in vitamins and other nutritional ingredients. This agreement is the first of what is expected to be several of such development and production projects. As part of the agreement, DSM will partner with Amyris and fund the development of the technology to produce the specific molecule that Amyris will scale and supply long term to deliver improved performance while growing its business. DSM will take the molecule to market utilizing its channel and market access and take advantage of Amyris’s biotechnology production, which provides a lower cost of production than currently available. "We are very excited to partner with DSM on our first product development and production agreement," said John Melo, Amyris President & CEO. "This is the first of what are expected to be several highly disruptive products addressing major markets where, together, we can leverage Amyris’s technology platform to reduce cost for products DSM then takes to market in a cost-advantaged position." About Amyris Amyris is the integrated renewable products company that is enabling the world's leading brands to achieve sustainable growth. Amyris applies its innovative bioscience solutions to convert plant sugars into hydrocarbon molecules and produce specialty ingredients and consumer products. The company is delivering its No Compromise® products across a number of markets, including specialty and performance chemicals, flavors and fragrances, cosmetics ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals. More information about the company is available at www.amyris.com.
