Get Delivery of Your Custom Lapel Pins In Just 10 days
																				Plus Free Artwork and Free UPS Air Shipping







As one of the oldest and most respected manufacturers of custom lapel pins, we understand what our customers want: quality products, great selection, help with choosing a design and excellent value.  That's just what we offer when you purchase your lapel pins from AllAboutPins.com. 
In addition, you benefit by getting plenty of extras free that most others charge for including express shipping and up to 7 colors at no extra charge.
Custom Lapel Pins Help You Achieve Your Marketing Goals
There are three primary goals in every marketing plan: create brand recognition, improve corporate identity and make an emotional connection with your customers.  

Well-made custom lapel pins represent your organization in fine fashion because they strengthen corporate identities based on distinction and quality.
Brand recognition is easily created and reinforced with lapel pins.  For each product launch, custom lapel pins can relay your logo or message in a memorable way that works continually on your behalf.  As others take notice, word-of-mouth marketing takes over as your message spreads.
Because lapel pins have a high perceived value and are often thought of as jewelry, they help bolster an emotional connection between you and your customers. 

Employee Relations Are Improved With Lapel Pins
A certain sense of pride comes with being recognized for performance and/or years of service.  As employees grow within your organization, enhance those feelings of pride by awarding custom lapel pins to those who have excelled.
Employee relations can be greatly improved when a recognition program is set into place using lapel pins.  Like metals on a military uniform, your staff will appreciate the recognition and will wear their pins with honor.

You were awesome to work with—if all our suppliers were as good as you guys then life would be easy. —Packaging Engineer at Harley-Davidson Motor Company
 
Thank you so much for getting back to me with more ideas. You have really done a great job of looking outside the box to try and come up with a solution to this packaging challenge we have. These new concepts definitely show your creativity in looking at the product differently. —Product Manager at Ideal Industries Inc.
 
Thanks for the fast turn on these—great service.—Director of Advertising and Creative Services at Johnsonville Sausage LLC
 
Thanks for the quick turnaround … always exceeding expectations!—Owner of Meteor Group Inc.
 
We have received the sleeves. They look fantastic; color is dead on; everyone is very impressed. It has taken our litho label and film suppliers multiple attempts to correctly hit the color. Thanks for all your help.—Packaging Engineer at Innoware Inc.
