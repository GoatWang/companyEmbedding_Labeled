As sales have dropped off, due to market saturation, they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process. This is routinely discussed on quarterly analyst calls, and the results haven't met expectations. Unfortunately, these efforts have been less than successful, and have created unintended consequences with a mass exodus of sales talent leaving the company, either by choice, or termination. Morale is at an all time low, with those staff remaining racing for the exits as quickly as possible, as the damage created is irreparable.Advice to ManagementSeek advice from your employees. So many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most. It's so disappointing because you really did have an incredibly loyal and proud workforce. Restoring that sense of pride and loyalty should begin with an executive management self assessment, and honest apologies to staff for the environment toxicity. Honestly may be difficult, but it is respected over continual excuses and blame.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-15 17:51 PDT Jul 26, 2017 Helpful (5)"Needs Innovation and Leadership!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Reis full-timeProsNew Offices in NYC are a nice upgrade from former location. Solid collection of historical CRE data that could be the foundation for solid company growth if an executive team were to be brought in that had the ability to lead, innovate and motivate its employees.ConsAll of the Executive Leadership of the company have no presence in the industry, completely lack leadership skills, offer no strategic vision (they consider minor, long overdue, product upgrades to be revolutionary new products), and worst of all encourage a gossipy, dreary, infighting environment rather than one of team work and high motivation. They prefer to sit in their offices rather than attend industry events, engage their customers and prospects, and believe they are above listening to their employees. Rather than admit to their continual string of errors and lack of innovation, they choose to blame the employees for their ongoing failures.Advice to ManagementMy advice would be for the founding partners - your loyalty to your executive team is admirable but if you want growth it is time for change. You have made numerous changes to your organization, both individual contributors and middle management, to no avail - at some point your executive team must be accountable rather than passing the buck to those below them. You need executive leadership that can innovate and one that your employees will respect and follow!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-26 17:58 PDT Jun 16, 2017 Helpful (1)"Great place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis (More than a year)ProsIf you work hard and show that you have a willingness to learn, you will get noticed and be compensated for it.

In fact, management is completely unhelpful and overall employee morale is at an all-time low. Reis cares more about quantity over quality and does not instill any positive reinforcement into their employees. Not quite sure how they sustain a business model in which the actual product they are providing clients has little to do with quality, depth or accuracy. At Reis we are quite literally told to not take our times on our work but instead to rush so we can complete more. Did I mention our performance is based solely on the #amount rather than any other factor? Doesn't make for a very accomplished feeling. Also, the positive reviews on this site are from Management who monitors this and makes sure to negate any true review like the one you are reading with a very untrue inaccurate review. Employees are underpaid, undervalued, and bored. I wouldn't wish this job on anyone.Advice to ManagementLearn how to actually manage because as a manager you are only as good as the employees you are responsible for. If we are all equally miserable, the problem starts with you.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-06-19 11:20 PDT Apr 25, 2017 Helpful (2)"Great Company To Work For!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis full-time (Less than a year)ProsI have nothing but great things to say about working at Reis.

Reis, Inc. Launches “Transaction Analytics™” for Commercial Property Sales; Product Empowers Investors and Portfolio Managers to Create Custom Commercial Real Estate Sales Trend and Forecast Analyses
NEW YORK OCTOBER 1, 2008: NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Reis, Inc. (NASDAQ: REIS) today responded to the current banking and financial crisis by launching Reis Transaction Analytics™, a tool that empowers commercial real estate investors and portfolio managers to identify sales and capital markets trends that are directly impacting the value of their assets. The resulting precision supports more informed valuations and decisions with regard to troubled debt and associated commercial real estate collateral.

At a time when economic distress is prompting market participants to continually revalue their holdings, Transaction Analytics™ frees investors and portfolio managers from a dependence on broader measures of real estate capital market activity, such as the "average" cap rate in a metropolitan area, which typically mask market volatility. "Many portfolio managers and investors are used to relying on overall metro indications of value simply because that is what they have had to work with in the past," said Michael Richardson, Reis's Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. "Transaction Analytics™ allows users to dig beneath the market averages for a closer look at the relevant trends in asset values."

For all of Reis's metro areas and regions, users of Transaction Analytics™ can obtain, on demand, a customized read on historical, current, and forecasted capital market conditions, offering key measurements of sales transaction activity, including mean, median, and 12-month rolling cap rates, total sales price, price per unit or square foot, and total transaction volume. The user may refine this analysis by including only properties that meet specified sales transaction characteristics (price or cap rate), or physical characteristics (size, age or class). All property level transactions are accessible within the module, providing complete transparency. "Transaction Analytics™ unleashes the full power of the Reis Sales Comparables database," said Reis Product Manager Kevin Varley. "At a time when there is a virtually unprecedented interest in all things real estate, this module addresses the critical questions that influence the valuation of commercial properties."

Reis has a deep tradition of helping its clients respond to crises with facts and data. "We helped the Resolution Trust Corporation assign value to billions of dollars worth of troubled debt collateral in the early 1990s. Since that time we have maintained continuity of leadership while developing a wealth of property level research, making Reis uniquely qualified to offer Transaction Analytics™ during this time of economic uncertainty," said Bill Sander, Reis's COO.

Transaction Analytics™ is available for purchase exclusively as an add-on module to Reis SE subscriptions. For more information, visit www.reis.com.

About Reis
Reis has been a provider of commercial real estate market information since 1980. Reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed information on commercial real properties in neighborhoods and metropolitan markets throughout the U.S. The database contains information on apartment, retail, office and industrial properties and is used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity investors to assess and quantify the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. Reis currently provides its information services to many of the nation's leading lending institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers.

Reis's flagship product is Reis SE, which provides online access to information and analytical tools designed to facilitate both debt and equity transactions. In addition to trend and forecast analysis at neighborhood and metropolitan levels, the product offers detailed building-specific information such as rents, vacancy rates and lease terms, property sale information, new construction listings and property valuation estimates. Reis SE is designed to meet the demand for timely and accurate information to support the decision-making of property owners, developers and builders, banks and non-bank lenders, and equity investors, all of whom require access to information on both the performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply and absorption. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development, and construction.

Relative Strength Alert For Reis
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Reis, Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.
