	Reis provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools to real estate professionals through its Reis Services subsidiary. Reis Services, including its predecessors, was founded in 1980. Reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed information on commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the U.S. The database contains information on apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage and seniors housing properties, and is used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity investors to assess, quantify and manage the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. Reis currently provides its information services to many of the nation’s leading lending institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers.

	The Company’s product portfolio features: Reis SE, its flagship delivery platform aimed at larger and mid-sized enterprises; ReisReports, aimed at prosumers and smaller enterprises; and Mobiuss Portfolio CRE, or Mobiuss, aimed primarily at risk managers and credit administrators at banks and non-bank lending institutions. It is through these products that Reis provides online access to a proprietary database of commercial real estate information and analytical tools designed to facilitate debt and equity transactions as well as ongoing asset and portfolio evaluations. Depending on the product or level of entitlement, users have access to market trends and forecasts at metropolitan and neighborhood levels throughout the U.S. and/or detailed building-specific information such as rents, vacancy rates, lease terms, property sales, new construction listings and property valuation estimates. Reis’s products are designed to meet the demand for timely and accurate information to support the decision-making of property owners, developers, builders, banks and non-bank lenders, equity investors and service providers.  These real estate professionals require access to timely information on both the performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply, absorption, rents and sale prices. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development and construction.

If you work hard, make sure to cover your markets, and make it known you are interested in more responsibilities, there are opportunities to advance. I didn't think I was interested in commercial real estate until working here but now I would like to stay in this industry moving forward.My coworkers are great and management is understanding. From what I've researched, salary is on par with the rest of the industry.ConsNo cons from me. If you enjoy research and are interested in real estate, this is a great place to learn.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-15 05:48 PDT Join the Reis team See Our Latest Jobs Jul 15, 2017 Helpful (5)"Circling the drain...caution advised"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Reis full-time (More than a year)ProsThe product is a market leader, and is essential to many CRE professionals daily work.ConsThe company is sadly losing what has made it great. As sales have dropped off, due to market saturation, they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process. This is routinely discussed on quarterly analyst calls, and the results haven't met expectations. Unfortunately, these efforts have been less than successful, and have created unintended consequences with a mass exodus of sales talent leaving the company, either by choice, or termination. Morale is at an all time low, with those staff remaining racing for the exits as quickly as possible, as the damage created is irreparable.Advice to ManagementSeek advice from your employees. So many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most. It's so disappointing because you really did have an incredibly loyal and proud workforce. Restoring that sense of pride and loyalty should begin with an executive management self assessment, and honest apologies to staff for the environment toxicity. Honestly may be difficult, but it is respected over continual excuses and blame.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-15 17:51 PDT Jul 26, 2017 Helpful (5)"Needs Innovation and Leadership!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Reis full-timeProsNew Offices in NYC are a nice upgrade from former location. Solid collection of historical CRE data that could be the foundation for solid company growth if an executive team were to be brought in that had the ability to lead, innovate and motivate its employees.ConsAll of the Executive Leadership of the company have no presence in the industry, completely lack leadership skills, offer no strategic vision (they consider minor, long overdue, product upgrades to be revolutionary new products), and worst of all encourage a gossipy, dreary, infighting environment rather than one of team work and high motivation. They prefer to sit in their offices rather than attend industry events, engage their customers and prospects, and believe they are above listening to their employees. Rather than admit to their continual string of errors and lack of innovation, they choose to blame the employees for their ongoing failures.Advice to ManagementMy advice would be for the founding partners - your loyalty to your executive team is admirable but if you want growth it is time for change. You have made numerous changes to your organization, both individual contributors and middle management, to no avail - at some point your executive team must be accountable rather than passing the buck to those below them. You need executive leadership that can innovate and one that your employees will respect and follow!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-26 17:58 PDT Jun 16, 2017 Helpful (1)"Great place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis (More than a year)ProsIf you work hard and show that you have a willingness to learn, you will get noticed and be compensated for it.

In fact, management is completely unhelpful and overall employee morale is at an all-time low. Reis cares more about quantity over quality and does not instill any positive reinforcement into their employees. Not quite sure how they sustain a business model in which the actual product they are providing clients has little to do with quality, depth or accuracy. At Reis we are quite literally told to not take our times on our work but instead to rush so we can complete more. Did I mention our performance is based solely on the #amount rather than any other factor? Doesn't make for a very accomplished feeling. Also, the positive reviews on this site are from Management who monitors this and makes sure to negate any true review like the one you are reading with a very untrue inaccurate review. Employees are underpaid, undervalued, and bored. I wouldn't wish this job on anyone.Advice to ManagementLearn how to actually manage because as a manager you are only as good as the employees you are responsible for. If we are all equally miserable, the problem starts with you.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-06-19 11:20 PDT Apr 28, 2017 Helpful (2)"Operations/Research"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Operations/Research in White Plains, NYCurrent Employee - Operations/Research in White Plains, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis full-timeProsNice people, professional atmosphere, room for growth, great medical benefits, good vacation time, and understanding managers.ConsThere can be favoritism at times regarding certain departments, employees and offices.Advice to ManagementCreating new positions should be considered, travel compensation would be a nice benefit, and perhaps some "reis" stock to full time employees can be implemented.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-04-28 05:10 PDT Apr 25, 2017 Helpful (2)"Great Company To Work For!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis full-time (Less than a year)ProsI have nothing but great things to say about working at Reis.

Reminder - Reis Goes Ex-Dividend Soon
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 6/5/17, Reis, Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.17, payable on 7/14/17. As a percentage of REIS's recent stock price of $18.90, this dividend works out to approximately 0.90%, so look for shares of Reis, Inc to trade 0.90% lower — all else being equal — when REIS shares open for trading on 6/5/17.

Relative Strength Alert For Reis
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Reis, Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Oversold Conditions For Reis
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

NEW YORK and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 18, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reis, Inc. (Nasdaq:REIS) ("Reis" or the "Company"), a leading provider of commercial real estate market information and analytical tools, today announced the introduction of an entirely new suite of reports focusing on the two Industrial property types that are most important to investors: Warehouse/Distribution and Flex/R&D. Against a backdrop of growing demand for detailed Industrial market coverage, Reis now offers the most comprehensive product available in more than 350 submarkets in the top 47 metropolitan industrial centers. For each metropolitan area, Reis provides the nation's first full suite of metro and submarket 
reports, including forecasts, and property-level rent, sales and construction comparables. The new product addresses a large vertical segment and revenue opportunity for the Company, positioning Reis to facilitate investor analysis of Industrial properties, a sector with nearly $75 billion in outstanding commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and publicly-traded Industrial REITs with an aggregate market capitalization in excess of $20 billion. Reis's new Industrial market reports will become immediately available to existing and new subscribers as an additional module through the company's Reis Subscriber Edition platform. The Company made the announcement at the NAIOP Development '11 conference in Scottsdale, Arizona.


 The product rollout significantly improves investor perspectives on the U.S. Industrial sector. Until now, Industrial market information has been characterized by poor definitions of competitive inventory, lack of critical submarket and property-level resolution, and data collection methods that generate more questions than answers. "We address all of these issues," said Reis's Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Lynford, "by diligently classifying each Industrial property according to the key factors that determine its comparability to peers: geographic submarket, functional use, and renter- versus owner-occupied status. By rigorously adhering to these quality control measures, Reis avoids problems associated with other sources, including underestimating a market's vacancy rate and producing trends of questionable relevance and accuracy. And, of course, only 
through the careful classification of the many types of industrial properties is it possible to provide meaningful rent and sales comparables reports, a fundamental tool for anyone involved in a commercial real estate sale or lease transaction."


 Reis's Chief Operating Officer, Bill Sander, cited subscriber demand as the driving factor behind the enhancement. "Reis is ever attentive to the needs of our long-term clients, many of whom have expressed their frustration at the quality of the Industrial market data they were receiving from other sources. We saw an opportunity to advance the practice of Industrial analysis by applying to this sector the same comprehensive data collection methodology that has made Reis the nation's most trusted provider of commercial real estate information for Apartment, Office, and Retail properties."


 Reis's launch of its enhanced Industrial coverage demonstrates the firm's commitment to constant product innovation as a driver of stockholder value. "Over the last four years, we have introduced eleven major expansions of coverage that have driven the growth of our business," Mr. Sander said. "Heading into 2012, we will continue to focus on monetizing these products, maintaining our aggressive pace of product development, while continuing to expand our subscriber base and placing ever more distance between ourselves and would-be competitors."
