					Full Description



CardioGenics Holdings Inc., incorporated on December 16, 1997, is engaged in business of development of products targeting the immunoassay segment of the point-of-care in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing market. The Company is engaged in development of technology and products, which include The QL Care Analyzer (QLCA), Cardiovascular Tests and Paramagnetic beads.QL Care AnalyzerThe QLCA is a point-of-care (POC) immunoassay analyzer. The QLCA represents a shift in the design of point-of-care (POC) analyzers. The QLCA uses a self-metering cartridge to perform immunoassay tests at the POC. Each cartridge is pre-loaded with the Company's beads, which have been coated with specific proteins, which result in binding the target marker. A few drops of whole blood added to the Cartridge initiate the binding reaction and the chemiluminescent reaction needed to deliver test results. The QLCA was designed specifically to deliver the required laboratory sensitivity.Cardiovascular TestsTo support the use of the QLCA, the Company develops approximately four immunoassay tests designed to identify cardiac markers in the blood at the time of a heart attack. These tests include Troponin I (TnI), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type-1 (PAI-1), Heart Failure Risk Stratification (HFRS) and Heart Failure Genomics Risk (HFGR). TnI testing is the routine testing for a heart attack. TnI is a heart muscle protein, released in the bloodstream shortly after a heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI). Its PAI-1 test helps to optimize the performance of a heart drug (tPA or tissue Plasminogen Activator), a clot buster used as the first line of therapy for MI patients. The Company is developing a test, the Heart Failure Risk Stratification or HFRS test to stratify the risk of death in patients with heart failure. The Company is developing a HFGR test that predicts the response of heart failure patients to routinely administered drugs. These tests are designed to be administered during the diagnostic and management process of patients with heart disease. The Company's TnI test product is in the pilot testing phase.Paramagnetic BeadsClinical and research laboratories use paramagnetic particles as a solid surface in heterogeneous immunoassay tests. Paramagnetic (magnetic) beads are the solid phase employed during immunoassays tests in these laboratories. The process of phase separation (separation of the magnetic beads) is done by application of an electromagnetic field. The paramagnetic beads are made of iron oxide, and all are traditionally black or brown. The Company has developed a process for plating the beads with a layer of silver, making them white, and sensitive to light.The Company competes with Biosite Diagnostics Incorporated, Response Biomedicals Corp., Roche and Abbott Diagnostics.
