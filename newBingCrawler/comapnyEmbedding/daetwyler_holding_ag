About Division Industries

The Daetwyler Group is a renowned, medium-sized, family-owned business run in the second generation, and has been based in the Swiss Plateau in Bleienbach (near Langenthal) since 1952.

Made up of the two independent divisions SwissTec and Industries, the Group is the world’s leading manufacturer of high-quality consumables for the printing industry and in the field of high-precision machine construction. The Group employs over 500 staff, 300 of whom work at the sites in Switzerland. With its own production facilities and almost 250 employees, Daetwyler is also present in the important global sales and purchasing markets in the USA, Eastern Europe, China and India. Thanks to access to a global sales and service network in over 40 countries, Daetwyler is able to remain close to its customers.

The Industries Division has many years of experience, comprehensive expertise and a wide range of specialist skills in high-precision machine construction. The division was created from the structures of the graphical goods business that started operations in 2009 as Heliograph Holding GmbH. What started off with unique industrial services was then continually developed further. Since 2014, the expansion of the three business fields has been driven further with the support of various acquisitions.

With innovative technological solutions, Industries generates significant added value for its customers – whether innovative product lines or unique industrial services, from the manufacturing of individual parts and assembly of units right up to the development and production of complex high-precision machines.
