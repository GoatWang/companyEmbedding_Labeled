Adgorithms Ltd.
("Adgorithms" or "the Company")
Company name change
 
 
Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to "Albert Technologies Ltd.".
The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.
From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.
The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/
Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, "This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations."

About Albert Technologies Ltd.
Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand. This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offers artificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.
The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.
 
About Albert
Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.
 
Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.
 
Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.

Adgorithms Inc., (LSE: ADGO), a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) marketing and advertising solutions, today announced Amy Inlow as the company’s new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). As CMO, Inlow’s primary task will be raising awareness for Adgorithms’ “Albert” the first-ever autonomous marketing platform capable of executing highly targeted and effective marketing and advertising campaigns across channels – paid and nonpaid – and devices, at a pace and scale that is no longer humanly possible. Improving its performance through optimization and self-learning and providing full transparency every step of the way, Albert frees marketers to focus on higher value problem solving.
An award-winning marketer with 20 years of strategic marketing and communications experience in the technology industry, Inlow comes to Adgorithms from Tracx where, as CMO, she led the company’s go-to-market strategy. During her tenure at Tracx, the company won more than sixteen awards for their best-in-class product, and her team was recognized by B2BMarketer as a finalist for their account-based marketing strategy.
Prior to Tracx, Inlow spent several years at Experian Marketing Services leading the transformation of the CheetahMail organization and brand, to cross-channel marketing, and finally to the Marketing Suite. While at Experian, Inlow built and oversaw a marketing team and lead generation machine that influenced more than 70 percent of the company’s pipeline, quadrupling the amount of quality, inbound leads through aggressive content marketing, which consistently beat best-in-class funnel and pipeline contribution metrics. Inlow also established and ran Experian’s Client Advisory Board, which consisted of top marketers from several marquee brands. Before Experian, Inlow held global marketing leadership roles at Operative and LivePerson.
“There’s been an overabundance of noise in the adtech and martech worlds with the move to digital – and across numerous channels and devices. Having a great product is only half the battle. To stand out, you must have effective marketing,” said Adgorithms CEO and Founder Or Shani. “Amy has been at the helm for several breakthrough marketing initiatives over the course of her career, and she possesses a natural ability to make complex technologies easily understood. We’re thrilled, and lucky, to have her.”
Inlow holds a BA in Communications and English from Boston College and lives in Connecticut with her family.

Albert Identified as One of Gartner’s “Cool Vendors in Advertising, 2017”


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Albert, created by Adgorithms (LSE:ADGO), was today identified by 
      Gartner as one of four “Cool Vendors in Advertising, 2017,” in a report 
      of the same name. According to Gartner, “Digital ad spend is forecast to 
      pass $200 billion in the U.S. this year, and an estimated 58% of ad 
      revenue will be transacted via programmatic channels.”
    

      Gartner determined the four key challenges marketing leaders are facing 
      this year to be:
    

      1. Advertising is experiencing unprecedented disruption that makes 
      marketing leaders struggle to manage programs and make decisions.
    

      2. The rapid growth of programmatic advertising, including video and 
      native formats, presages a future of increasingly machine-supported 
      media planners.
    

      3. As they invest more in digital channels, marketing leaders are 
      frustrated by the industry's opacity, needless complexity and a plethora 
      of middlemen.
    

      4. Fraud is a significant problem obscuring measurement and inflating 
      costs, and fraudsters are getting more sophisticated.
    

      Gartner also identified four recommendations to address these challenges:
    

      1. Tune out the fear and unease occasioned by artificial intelligence 
      and focus on its practical application as a way to automate complex 
      tasks, such as A/B testing, segmentation and recommendations.
    

      2. Consult your media buying and analytics teams to determine if a more 
      customizable bidder would help, especially if you are frustrated by the 
      limits of your programmatic platform.
    

      3. Collect and retain user-level data about key marketing events across 
      channels such as websites, apps, email and advertising; use as a basis 
      for better attribution.
    

      4. Take steps to minimize the impact of fraud on your ad buys, using ad 
      verification technologies, white- and black-lists and detailed reporting.
    

      Gartner’s report identified Albert as one of four “Cool Advertising 
      Vendors” that are addressing these challenges.
    

      Albert is a fully autonomous digital advertising and marketing solution 
      that can independently execute digital campaigns. Albert serves as a 
      highly-intelligent member of brands’ marketing teams. Albert is able to 
      analyze millions of data points per minute to determine the best 
      combinations of creative images and text across search display, social 
      media, email and SMS. Albert allows marketers to target current client 
      segments, site visitors, and entirely new audiences. Albert learns as he 
      goes, creating audience micro-segments, and identifying the most 
      effective means of reaching customers.
    

      "We very deliberately built Albert to combat the complexities and 
      challenges that Gartner has noted as plaguing digital marketing and 
      advertising today," said Or Shani, CEO of Albert. "We saw the early 
      signs of an industry on the verge of disruption and chaos over seven 
      years ago, and were able to predict then what we're experiencing now. 
      That's what makes Albert so relevant at this moment in time – and it's 
      why a number of historically cautious marketers are adopting artificial 
      intelligence so early in the game. They simply can't do it on their own 
      – no matter how sophisticated and large their teams are."

AlbertTM Named SIIA Business Technology CODiE Award Finalist for Best Advertising or Campaign Management Platform


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Albert, created by Adgorithms (LSE:ADGO), today announced that their 
      signature AI platform was named a 2017 SIIA CODiE Awards finalist in the 
      Best Advertising or Campaign Management category. Finalists represent 
      the best products, technologies, and services in software, information 
      and business technology.


      AlbertTM is the first and only fully autonomous artificial 
      intelligence driven marketing tool that can independently execute 
      transparent, cross-channel digital campaigns. Albert has drastically 
      improved the sales and ROI for every brand “he’s” worked with, vastly 
      exceeding expectations. “His” work has led to grocery stores running 
      out of stock of Dole’s fruit-cocktails, caused Cosabella to 
      completely eliminate 
      their use of traditional advertising agencies, and was credited with 
      40% of Harley-Davidson’s NYC motorcycle sales.


      The SIIA 
      CODiE Awards are the premier awards for the software and information 
      industries, and have been recognizing product excellence for over 30 
      years. The awards offer 93 categories that are organized by industry 
      focus of education technology and business technology. Albert was 
      honored as one of 205 finalists across the 59 business technology 
      categories.


      “I am impressed by the level of innovation and creativity of the 
      products that have been selected as this year's CODiE Award finalists. 
      We are happy to recognize these products and the power they have to 
      transform the future of how we do business.” said Ken Wasch, President 
      of SIIA.


      “This time last year we were trying to educate the marketing industry on 
      artificial intelligence; this year we can confidently say it’s catching 
      on,” said Or Shani, Founder of Albert and CEO of Adgorithms. “The 
      exponential increase in adoption of artificial intelligence—and the 
      drastic increase in sales and ROI that our clients’ campaigns are 
      producing—is indicative of AI’s ability to completely revolutionize the 
      way digital campaigns are run. We are honored to be recognized by such 
      an influential organization.”


      The SIIA CODiE Awards are the industry's only peer-recognized awards 
      program. Business technology leaders including senior executives, 
      analysts, media, consultants and investors evaluate assigned products 
      during the first-round review which determines the finalists. SIIA 
      members then vote on the finalist products and the scores from both 
      rounds are tabulated to select the winners. Winners will be announced 
      during the CODiE 
      Award Business Technology Winner Announcement & Celebration, 
      July 25 in San Francisco.


      Details about each finalist are listed at http://www.siia.net/codie/Finalists


About the SIIA CODiE™ AwardsThe SIIA CODiE Awards is 
      the only peer-reviewed program to showcase business and education 
      technology’s finest products and services. Since 1986, thousands of 
      products, services and solutions have been recognized for achieving 
      excellence. For more information, visit siia.net/CODiE.


About AlbertTM (created by Adgorithms)Albert, 
      created by Adgorithms (LSE: ADGO), is the first-ever fully autonomous 
      artificial intelligence marketing platform, driving digital marketing 
      campaigns from start to finish for some of the world’s leading 
      brands. Albert’s mission is to liberate businesses from the complexities 
      of digital marketing—not just by replicating their existing efforts, but 
      by executing them at a pace and scale not previously possible. He serves 
      as a highly intelligent and sophisticated member of brands’ marketing 
      teams, wading through mass amounts of data, converting this data into 
      insights, and autonomously acting on these insights, across channels, 
      devices and formats, in real time. This eliminates the manual and 
      time-consuming tasks that currently limit the effectiveness and results 
      of modern digital advertising and marketing. Brands such as Harley 
      Davidson, EVISU, Cosabella, and Made.com credit 
      Albert with significantly increased sales, an accelerated path to 
      revenue, the ability to make more informed investment decisions, and 
      reduced operational costs. Visit albert.ai.

Adgorithms Ltd.


('Adgorithms' or 'the Company')


Company name change


Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to 'Albert Technologies Ltd.'.


The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.


From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.


The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/


Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, 'This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations.'

About Albert Technologies Ltd.

Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand.This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offersartificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.

The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.


About Albert


Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.


Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.


Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.

Company name changeWed, 12th Jul 2017 12:04RNS Number : 8714K Adgorithms Limited 12 July 2017  

12 July 2017
 
 
Adgorithms Ltd.
("Adgorithms" or "the Company")
Company name change
 
 
Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to "Albert Technologies Ltd.".
The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.
From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.
The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/
Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, "This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations."

About Albert Technologies Ltd.
Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand. This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offers artificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.
The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.
 
About Albert
Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.
 
Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.
 
Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.
