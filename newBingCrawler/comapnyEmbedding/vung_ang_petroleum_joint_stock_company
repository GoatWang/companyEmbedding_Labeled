Vung Ang thermal plant BOT deal talks heat up


The Vung Ang 2 thermal power project is in the final stage of build-operate-transfer negotiations with the intention of starting construction early next year. 

Once operational, the BOT Vung Ang 2 thermal power plant will help improve Vietnam’s electricity supply
Vung Ang 2 Thermal Power Joint Stock Company (VAPCO), the investor in the 1,200 megawatt Vung Ang 2 project recently reported to the Ha Tinh provincial authorities that the investor had submitted build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It is expected to start construction in March 2015.
It will become the sixth foreign-invested BOT power project in Vietnam over the past decade, following Phu My 2, Phu My 3, Mong Duong 2 plant, Hai Duong power plant and Vinh Tan 3 plant.
The 1,200 megawatt Vung Ang 2 project is a part of the Vung Ang thermal power centre in the central province of Ha Tinh, where the state-run PetroVietnam is building the Vung Ang 11,200 megawatt power plant.
The project is being built by VAPCO, a joint venture between the locally-owned Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Corporation (REE) and OneEnergy Asia Limited, which is a 50/50 partnership between Hong Kong’s CLP Holdings and Japan’s Mitsubishi Group. VAPCO was established in 2007, with BOT contract negotiations starting in 2009. Conversion of foreign currency has proven to be a tricky obstacle in BOT contract negotiations.
Under the prime ministerial Document 1604/TTg-KTN, the Vietnamese government guarantees conversion into US dollar for 30 per cent of the project revenue in VND. However, investors in BOT power projects with ongoing negotiations such as Vung Ang 2 and Van Phong requested up to 100 per cent foreign currency exchange guarantee.
Since Vietnam opened its doors to foreign investors, the Vietnamese government has licensed only five BOT power projects. However, increasing domestic electricity demand has attracted foreign investors to the country’s power sector.
Although Vietnam’s economy is still in a downturn, the electricity demand in the first half of this year rose 11   per cent year on year. The  MoIT estimated that the demand would continue to increase from 11 to 13 per cent next year.  By Phuong Thu

 Petrovietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation (PVC)
  30 YEARS OF FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT


Petrovietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation (PVC) is a member of the Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (Petrovietnam) – the leading economic conglomerate of Vietnam. Over last 30 years, PVC has made efforts to become a major construction corporation of the petroleum industry with professional management skills and international-level technologies for construction of petroleum-specialized projects and large-scale industrial and civil works as well.
          Predecessor of PVC is Petroleum Construction Conjunction Factory, established on 14th September 1983 by the Decision No.1069/DK-TC of the General Department of Oil and Gas with the principal mission of preparing material facilities for petroleum industry. During the period from the inception to 1990, the Factory has gradually overcome the initial difficulties, made changes in the management structure and method to ensure the schedule and quality of projects.
         In 1990, the Vietnam Oil & Gas Corporation was founded (the predecessor of the Vietnam National Oil & Gas Group), Petroleum Construction Conjunction Factory plays a major role in design and construction of petroleum works. In 1995, the Factory was renamed the Petroleum Construction & Design Company (PVECC). In the period 1990 - 1997, the Factory completed more than 20 jackets for fixed drilling rigs and more than 10 jacket blocks for DK1 complexes (floating houses) on the Southern continental shelf and on Truong Sa archipelago, contributing to protection of national defense and security for the countrys territorial waters. It has also built and installed successfully a gas pipeline system from Bach Ho oilfield to the mainland with 100km offshore and 20km onshore to operate Ba Ria Power Plant, whereby it affirmed the important role in the field of industrial construction.
          On 17th March 2005, the Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation decided to change PVECC to Petroleum Construction Joint Stock Company. In 2007, the Chairman of the Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group signed Resolution No. 3604/NQ-DKVN on transforming Petroleum Construction Joint Stock Company into PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation (PVC).
          30 years have passed so far, PVC has increasingly asserting its outstanding prestige and capability in the implementation of key projects/works of the petroleum industry and the country as well. PVC s important role has been marked in such projects/works as Onshore General Services Base in Vung Tau, gas pipeline projects from Long Hai to Phu My, My Xuan, Dong Nai industrial zones; the national key projects namely Phu My Fertilizer Plant, Ca Mau Gas-Power-Fertilizer Complex, Dung Quat Refinery, Vung Ang 1 Thermal Power Plant, Thai Binh 2 Thermal Power Plant,...
          Having matured by projects, since the time of working as a subcontractor for international contractors, PVC has now become an EPC contractor capable to implement larger-scale projects with complicated technical requirements such as : Go Dau LPG Storage, Thai Binh 2 Thermal Power Plant, Nhon Trach 2 Thermal Power Plant, North Bio-fuel Ethanol Plant, Dinh Vu Polyester Plant,...
          Especially, PVC’s strong position in petroleum-specialized construction is increasingly asserted by the implementation of most projects in transportation and storage of oild and gas under EPC contracts such as Cu Lao Tao Petroleum Storage, Dung Quat tank truck station and LPG Storage,... In design, fabrication, construction and installation of rigs and rig jackets: PVC has fabricated various key works and structures, notably Dai Hung rig jacket, Moc Tinh 1 rig jacket and topside - Bien Dong Project...
         PVC has unceasingly consolidated and developed its traditional fields such as: construction of works for storage and transportation of oil and gas products, mechanical fabrication and installation of petroleum equipment,...
        PVC’s brand is also marked by the civil and industrial construction with projects namely Petrovietnam Finance Center, Vietnam Petroleum Institute, Phu My Hung Petroleum Building, Vung Tau Petroleum Hotel, Dragon Tower,...
       Through its growning-up way, PVC and its subsidiaries have continuously developed and made contribution to the development of the Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group. "Big Targets, Big Efforts" is what PVC leaders and employees understand thoroughly. With a substainable foundation built up on its development route and determination of PVC staff (PVCers), Petrovietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation will make efforts to further develop on the way ahead, contributing to the cause of Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group and the prosperity of the country in general.
       Recently, to acknowledge its remarkable dedications to the cause of socio-economic development of the country, the State of Vietnam awarded PVC various noble honors, namely First Class Labor Medal, Labour Hero Title...
