            Takes the average of data over a 
            period of time, and migrates the period across the data 
            series one data point at a time. This formula smooths a
            data series and makes analysing volatile data easier.
        

            A moving average that gives more weight to the more 
            recent data in the period and less weight to the older 
            data in the period. 
        

            Compares a short period moving average and a long period 
            moving average of prices. MACD is used with a 9-day 
            exponential moving average as a signal that identifies 
            buying or selling moments.
        

            A momentum oscillator formula that compares 
            upward movements of the close price with downward 
            movements.  RSI is considered overbought when above 
            70 and oversold when below 30.
        

            Calculates the rate of price change compared with historical
            data. It calculates the rate of change against a period of 
            days prior to the current price. The output is a percentage.
        

            A moving average of the volume rather
            than the price. VMA represents the average volume over the 
            specified periods of time and can be used to chart a stock.
        

            Calculates the standard deviation above and below a simple 
            moving average of the data. Since standard deviation is a 
            measure of volatility, a large standard deviation indicates 
            a volatile market, and a smaller standard deviation 
            indicates a calmer market.
        

            A momentum indicator that compares closing price with the price range over a given time period.
        

            A moving average is taken of the stochastic oscillator which reduces sensitivity to market fluctuations.

            A fully customizable version of the Slow Stochastic Oscillator. Input parameters can be set by the user.
