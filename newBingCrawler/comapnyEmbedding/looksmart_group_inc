(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to those statements, which appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We use words such as "believes," "intends," "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "may," "will" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Discussions containing forward-looking statements may be found in the material set forth under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in other sections of this report. All forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, projections, expectations or estimates concerning our business, including demand for our products and services, mix of revenue sources, ability to control and/or reduce operating expenses, anticipated gross margins and operating results, cost savings, product development efforts, general outlook of our business and industry, future profits or losses, competitive position, share-based compensation, adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements, are inherently uncertain as they are based on our expectations and assumptions concerning future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including but not limited to, the possibility that we may fail to maintain or grow our listings advertiser base and/or distribution network, that existing and potential distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or pricing terms, that we may be unable to grow our online search advertising revenue and/or find alternative sources of revenue, that we may be unable to attain or maintain customer acceptance of our publisher solutions products, that changes in the distribution network composition may lead to decreases in query volumes, that we may be unable to maintain or improve our query volume, match rate, number of paid clicks, average revenue per click, conversion rate or other ad network metrics, that we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability, that we may be unable to retain our existing credit facilities or obtain new credit facilities, that we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses, that we may be unable to remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or that one or more of the other risks described elsewhere in this report may occur.  All forward-looking statements in this report are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and except as required by applicable law; we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, there had been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.  Business Overview  For a description of our business, please refer to Note 1.  Results of Operations Overview of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 The following tables set forth selected information concerning our results of operations as a percentage of consolidated net revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Revenue $ 836 100.0 % $ 1,020 100.0 % $ (184 ) (18 )% Cost of revenue 507 60.6 % 412 40.4 % 95 23 % Gross profit 329 39.4 % 608 59.6 % (279 ) (46 )% Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 113 13.5 % 295 28.9 % (182 ) (62 )% Product development and technical operations 509 60.9 % 631 61.9 % (122 ) (19 )% General and administrative 196 23.4 % 477 46.8 % (281 ) (59 )% Restructuring charge - 0.1 % 217 21.3 % (217 ) (100 )% Total operating expenses 818 97.8 % 1,620 158.8 % (802 ) (50 )% Income /loss from operations (489 ) (58.5 )% (1,012 ) (99.2 )% 523 (52 )% Non-operating income (expense), net (29 ) (3.5 )% 19 1.9 % (48 ) (253 )% Loss from operations before income taxes (518 ) (62.0 )% (993 ) (97.4 )% 475 (48 )% Income tax expense 16 - - - 16 - Net loss $ (502 ) (60.0 )% $ (993 ) (97.4 )% $ 491 (49 )%   Six Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Revenue 1,838 100.0 % $ 2,004 100.0 % $ (166 ) (8 )% Cost of revenue 1,085 59.0 % 864 43.1 % 221 26 % Gross profit 753 41.0 % 1,140 56.9 % (387 ) (34 )% Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 276 15.0 % 703 35.1 % (427 ) (61 )% Product development and technical operations 857 46.6 % 1,333 66.5 % (476 ) (36 )% General and administrative 436 23.7 % 807 40.3 % (371 ) (46 )% Restructuring charge 9 0.6 % 293 14.7 % (284 ) (97 )% Total operating expenses 1,578 85.9 % 3,136 156.5 % (1,558 ) (50 )% Loss from operations (825 ) (44.9 )% (1,996 ) (99.6 )% 1,171 (59 )% Non-operating income (expense), net (32 ) (1.7 )% 15 0.7 % (47 ) (313 )% Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (857 ) (46.6 %) (1,981 ) (98.9 )% 1,124 (57 )% Income tax expense - - - 0.0 % - - Net loss $ (857 ) (46.6 )% $ (1,981 ) (98.8 )% $ 1,124 (57 )%  Revenue  Revenue is derived from two service offerings or "products" of LookSmart Group (the "Company"): Advertiser Networks and Publisher Solutions. Total revenue and revenue from Advertiser Networks and Publisher Solutions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, was as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Advertiser Networks $ 836 100 % $ 1,020 100 % $ (184 ) (18 )% Publisher Solutions - - 0 % - Total revenue $ 836 100 % $ 1,020 100 % $ (184 ) (18 )%   Six Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Advertiser Networks $ 1,838 100 % $ 2,003 100 % $ (165 ) (8 )% Publisher Solutions - 0 % 1 0 % (1 ) (100 )% Total revenue $ 1,838 100 % $ 2,004 100 % $ (166 ) (8 )%  Advertiser Networks  The decrease in Advertiser Networks revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 is the result of a reduction in revenues from all categories: Intermediaries, Direct Advertisers and Self Service Advertisers. We experienced a continuing decrease in Advertising Network revenue in the six months of 2016 following a trend that began in late 2011.  In the six months of 2016, revenue from Intermediaries decreased compared to the six months of 2015.  In the six months of 2016, revenue from Direct Advertisers decreased compared to the six months of 2015.  In the six months of 2016, revenue from Self Service Advertisers decreased compared to the six months of 2015.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  Cost of revenue is primarily TAC (costs paid to our distribution network partners). Other costs include data center rent and power usage and credit card fees.  Cost of revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Traffic acquisition costs $ 390 47 % $ 370 36 % $ 20 5 % Other costs 117 14 % 42 3 % 75 179 % Total cost of revenue $ 507 61 % $ 412 40 % $ 95 23 % Six Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Traffic acquisition costs $ 869 47 % $ 792 40 % $ 77 10 % Other costs 216 12 % 72 4 % 144 200 % Total cost of revenue $ 1,085 59 % $ 864 43 % $ 221 26 %  TAC increased $0.02 and $0.08 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  Certain other costs, such as data center costs and power usage, are generally fixed costs. Total cost of revenue decreased in 2016 primarily as result of decreases of TAC combined with decreases in other costs in the current year.  TAC as a percentage of Advertiser Network revenue increased to 61% and 59% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 40% and 43% in the same period in 2015 as a result of overall revenue mix changes from 2015 to 2016.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, decreased by $0.8 million and $1.5 million. Contributing factors included decreases in sales and marketing costs, product and development costs, general and administrative costs.  Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, product development and technical operations, general and administrative, and restructuring charges for the three months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, and were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Sales and marketing $ 113 14 % $ 295 29 % $ (182 ) (62 )% Product development and technical operations 509 61 % 631 62 % (122 ) (19 )% General and administrative 196 22 % 477 47 % (281 ) (59 )% Restructuring charge 0 0 % 217 - (217 ) (100 )% Total operating expenses $ 818 97 % $ 1,620 138 % $ (802 ) (50 )% Six Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Sales and marketing $ 276 15 % $ 703 35 % $ (427 ) (61 )% Product development and technical operations 857 47 % 1,333 67 % (476 ) (36 )% General and administrative 436 24 % 807 40 % (371 ) (46 )% Restructuring charge 9 0 % 293 15 % (284 ) (97 )% Total operating expenses $ 1,578 86 % $ 3,136 157 % $ (1,558 ) (50 )%  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses in the current year include salaries, share-based compensation and other costs of employment for our sales force, sales administration and customer service staff and marketing personnel, overhead, facilities and allocation of depreciation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of advertising, trade shows, public relations activities and various other activities supporting our customer acquisition effort.  The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, reflects a reduction in our sales and marketing personnel.  Product Development and Technical Operations  Product development and technical operations expense includes all costs related to the continued operations, development and enhancement of our core technology product, the AdCenter platform. The AdCenter is used to operate both our own Advertiser Network and other publishers' client networks, and is licensed to publishers to operate their own network. These costs include salaries and associated costs of employment, including share-based compensation, overhead, and facilities. Software licensing and computer equipment depreciation related to supporting product development and technical operations functions are also included in product development and technical operations expense.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses include personnel cost, legal, insurance, tax and accounting, consulting, professional services fees and the provision for, and reductions of, the allowance for doubtful trade receivables.  Other Items The tables below set forth other continuing operations data for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Non-operating income (expense), net Interest income $ - - $ - 0 % $ - - Interest expense (16 ) - (1 ) - (15 ) 100 % Other income, net (13 ) (2 %) 20 2 % (33 ) (165 %) Total non-operating income (expense), net $ (29 ) (2 %) $ 19 2 % $ (48 ) (253 %) Income tax expense $ 16 - $ - - $ 16 - Six Months Ended June 30, % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Non-operating income (expense), net Interest income $ - (1 %) $ - 0 % $ - - Interest expense (32 ) - (1 ) - (31 ) 3100 % Other income (expense), net - 0 % 16 - (16 ) (100 %) Total non-operating income (expense), net $ (32 ) (1 %) $ 15 1 % $ (47 ) (313 %) Income tax expense $ - - $ - - $ - -  Interest Income and Expense  Interest expense, primarily consisting of interest paid on capital leases, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, increased as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the loan we obtained from Inca Capital starting May 2015. (Please see Other Obligations)  Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows were as follows for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 2015 Change Net cash used in operating activities $ (535 ) $ (1,403 ) $ 868 Net cash provided by investing activities - (290 ) 290 Net cash used in financing activities 430 1,872 (1,442 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 7 7 - Increase/(Decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (98 ) $ 186 $ (284 )  Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances were as follows as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):   June 30, December 31, 2015 2015 Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 109 $ 207 $ (98 ) Short-term investments 36 36 - Total $ 145 $ 243 $ (98 ) % of total assets 4 % 5 % Total assets $ 3,994 $ 4,539  At June 30, 2016, we had approximately $0.15 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments. Cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government, commercial paper, time deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. corporate securities, collateralized debt obligations and other commodities. We actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and the institutions of whose debt instruments we hold. Our investment policy, which is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors, primarily emphasizes safety of principal while secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. These balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, "Cash and Available for Sale Securities," which describes further the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments decreased $0.1 million to $0.15 million at June 30, 2016, from $0.24 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to operating losses.  Our primary source of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our current primary use of cash is to fund operating losses and investment in software development. . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our services beyond the current quarter, and changes in customer buying behavior. Also, if the banking system or the financial markets continue to remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures, take advantage of favorable business opportunities, develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure, develop new product and service offerings, take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments, including the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution.  Operating Activities  Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2016, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash used in operations in the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.535 million and consisted of a net loss of $0.857 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.475 million and cash used by working capital and other activities of $0.13 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.475 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $0.04 amortization of deferred rent, $0.008 in amortization of deferred lease incentive, and $0.009 million in other non-cash charges. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a $0.062 million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, an increase of $0.176 million in accounts receivable and a $0.163 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to decreased TAC and operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.

Cash used in operations in the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $1.4 million and consisted of a net loss of $2.0 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.6 million and cash used by working capital and other activities of zero. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment and purchased software. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a $0.2 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, an increase of $0.04 million in accounts receivable and a $0.09 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.  Investing Activities  Cash provided by investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2016 was zero.  Cash used in investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2015 of $0.3 million was attributed to $0.4 million purchase of intangible assets partially offset by $0.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments.  Financing Activities  Cash provided by financing activities in the six months of 2016 of $0.43 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities from Snowy August Management, LLC. (See Other Obligations)  Cash provided by financing activities in the six months of 2015 of $1,872 is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities and notes payable, as well as proceeds from additional paid-in capital from Inca Capital, Snowy August Management, LLC and Pyxis Tankers Inc.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4), investments in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  In comparison with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that there have been no material changes in contractual obligations or commercial commitments outside the ordinary course of business, during the three months ended June 30, 2016.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Michael Onghai, President and Chief Executive Officer of LookSmart, Ltd. (Nasdaq:   LOOK), said today that he is very pleased to announce the shareholders of LookSmart, Ltd., at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders held the morning of October 26, 2015, overwhelmingly approved the following resolutions:  

To effect a reverse split of LookSmart, Ltd.'s outstanding common stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-two and not more than one-for-ten at any time prior to November 30, 2015, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range, as determined by LookSmart, Ltd.'s board of directors in its sole discretion. 
To adopt a spin-off of LookSmart, Ltd.'s business, assets and liabilities into LookSmart Group, Inc. 
To adopt an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Pyxis Tankers Inc., Maritime Technologies Corp., LookSmart, Ltd. and LookSmart Group, Inc., and to approve the transactions contemplated by such agreement.
About LookSmart, Ltd.
LookSmart, Ltd. was organized in 1996 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware. LookSmart, Ltd. is a digital advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search and display advertising customers, organized along five lines of business: (i) Clickable, (ii) LookSmart AdCenter, (iii) Novatech.io, (iv) ShopWiki and (v) web searches. In addition, LookSmart, Ltd. formed a partnership with Conversion Media Holdings, LLC, which supports the company's other lines of business through the creation of content sites directed at ecommerce verticals. The company operates its partnership and each line of business, while being related to the others in terms of shared resources, as separate business lines with their own core management, profits and losses, and the ability to operate independently as separate businesses. As a result, this separation of business lines allows Looksmart, Ltd. to operate effectively as a holding company and as a capital allocator to each of the company's separate businesses with the goal of finding mispriced assets in the public and private markets and subsequently taking those assets to create scalable and sustainable businesses that may then be monetized for the ultimate benefit of Looksmart, Ltd.'s stockholders.

SAN FRANCISCO and ATHENS, Greece, April 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- LookSmart, Ltd. (NASDAQ:   LOOK) and privately-held Pyxis Tankers Inc. ("Pyxis") today jointly announced that they have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby Pyxis will become a publicly listed company as a result of the merger between LookSmart, Ltd. ("LookSmart") and Pyxis' wholly-owned subsidiary, Maritime Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation. In addition, LookSmart will spin off its existing business into a new entity called LookSmart Group, Inc. ("LookSmart Group").
Pyxis Tankers Inc.
Pyxis Tankers Inc. is a newly formed international maritime transportation company with a focus on the tanker sector. At the consummation of the merger with LookSmart, Pyxis' fleet will be comprised of six double hull product tankers with an average current age of four years and that are employed under a mix of short- and medium-term time charters and spot charters. Pyxis will acquire these six vessels prior to the merger from an affiliate of its founder and chief executive officer, Mr. Valentios ("Eddie") Valentis. Four of the vessels in the fleet will be medium-range, or MR, product tankers, three of which have eco-efficient or eco-modified designs and two will be short-range tanker sister ships. Each of the vessels in the fleet is capable of transporting refined petroleum products, such as naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil, as well as other liquid bulk items, such as vegetable oils and organic chemicals.
Pyxis' principal objective will be to own and operate its fleet in a manner that will enable it to benefit from short- and long-term trends that Pyxis expects in the product tanker sector to maximize its revenues and to enhance returns to its stockholders. Pyxis intends to expand the fleet through selective acquisitions of modern product tankers in a manner that is accretive to stockholder value. It expects to employ its vessels primarily through time charters to creditworthy customers and on the spot market. Pyxis intends to continually evaluate the markets in which it operates and, based upon its view of market conditions, adjust its mix of vessel employment by counterparty and stagger its charter expirations. In addition, Pyxis may choose to opportunistically direct asset sales when opportunities exist for subsequent accretive vessel acquisitions and conditions are primed to generate attractive returns for its stockholders.
Mr. Valentis commented, "A publicly-traded growth-oriented product tanker company will be created upon closing of the merger that we believe is unique among our competitors. We at Pyxis Tankers look forward to communicating to the LookSmart shareholders and the investment community about our value creation story and growth opportunities."
The Transactions
Spin-Off
Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, LookSmart transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities (including its Clickable, Ad Center and web search businesses) to LookSmart Group. Upon completion of this spin-off, LookSmart Group, will be 100% owned by LookSmart's stockholders of record.
Merger
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, LookSmart will merge with and into Maritime Technologies Corp., which will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pyxis. Upon completion of the merger, each share of LookSmart's common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be exchanged for the right to receive a certain number of shares of Pyxis' common stock equal to $4,000,000, as adjusted for the price and number of LookSmart's outstanding common stock as of the date that the merger becomes effective.  After the completion of the merger, and assuming no adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the public stockholders of LookSmart are expected to own approximately 5.66% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of Pyxis.
Pyxis intends to apply to have its common stock listed on either the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE MKT under the symbol "PXS."
LookSmart's Chief Executive Officer, Michael Onghai, stated, "We are very pleased to give our stockholders this value enhancing transaction. Our stockholders will have an opportunity to also own shares in Pyxis without diluting their existing ownership in LookSmart and its subsidiaries including Clickable, Inc., all of which will be transferred into a new entity called LookSmart Group, Inc. This transaction enables LookSmart Group to remain public with lower costs of being public and more flexibility for its fast-growing subsidiaries to raise capital with alternative sources of financing such as venture capital. At the same time, this transaction offers Pyxis a chance to be listed on a major stock exchange."
The Make Whole Record Date
In the event that subsequent to the Merger, Pyxis completes a financing which results in gross proceeds to Pyxis of at least $5,000,000 (a "Future Pyxis Offering") at a valuation lower than the valuation ascribed to the shares of common stock received by LookSmart stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the "Consideration Value"), Pyxis will be obligated to make "whole" the LookSmart stockholders as of April 29, 2015 (the "Make Whole Record Date") by offering such LookSmart stockholders the right to receive additional shares of Pyxis common stock to compensate the LookSmart stockholders for the difference in value of their Pyxis common stock.
In addition, should Pyxis fail to complete a Future Pyxis Offering within a date which is 3 years from the date of the closing of the Merger, each holder of the Company's common stock who has held such stock continuously from the date of the Make Whole Record Date until the expiration of such 3 year period (the "Legacy LS Stockholders") will have a 24-hour option beginning at the end of the 3 year period to require Pyxis to purchase from such Legacy LS Stockholders a pro rata amount of Pyxis common stock that would result in aggregate gross proceeds to the Legacy LS Stockholders in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000; provided that in no event shall a Legacy LS Stockholder receive an amount per share greater than the Consideration Value.

	FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION



	 


	This Annual Report contains forward-looking
	statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
	as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. We have attempted to identify forward-looking
	statements by terminology including “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “can,”
	“continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,”
	“plans,” “potential,” “predict,” “should” or “will” or the negative
	of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause
	our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels
	or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the
	expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity,
	performance or achievements. Our expectations are as of the date this Annual Report is filed, and we do not intend to update any
	of the forward-looking statements after the date this Annual Report is filed to confirm these statements to actual results, unless
	required by law.


	 


	This Annual Report also contains estimates
	and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other industry data. This
	data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have
	not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties and contained in this Annual
	Report and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do generally believe the data to be reliable.
	In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which
	we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. Our actual results could
	differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the
	possibility that we may fail to preserve our expertise in search advertising network product development; that existing and potential
	distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products
	or pricing terms; that seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional advertising seasonality are likely to affect our
	business; that we may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that changes in the distribution network composition may
	lead to decreases in query volumes; that we may be unable to maintain or improve our query volume, match rate, number of paid clicks,
	average revenue per click, conversion rate or other ad network metrics; that we may be unable to attain and maintain profitability;
	that we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel; that we may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase, our relationships
	with international customers; that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses; or that one or more of the other risks
	described below in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this annual report may occur. These and other
	factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

	Overview



	 


	LookSmart Group, Inc.
	(“LookSmart” or the “Company”) was organized in 2015 and is incorporated in the State of Nevada. LookSmart
	Group was spun-off from its predecessor, LookSmart Limited (“Predecessor”), as a result of a reverse merger and spin-off
	transaction (the “Transaction”) with Pyxis Tankers(“Pyxis”).


	 


	The Predecessor completed
	the Transaction on October 28

	th

	 2015. For year to year comparisons, when we refer to the year 2014, we are referring
	to the Predecessor since the Company was organized in 2015.


	 


	Prior to the execution
	of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company in anticipation
	of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and the liabilities
	of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s shares of the common
	stock shall be cancelled and Company shall be 100% owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record date
	set for said distribution. As a result of the Spin-off, each share of the Predecessor received one share of LookSmart Group common
	stock. Following the merger, LookSmart Group had a total of 5,768,851 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company’s
	stock is traded in the OTCMarkets Pinksheets.


	 


	In addition, in connection
	with the reverse merger with Pyxis, the Predecessor consummated a 1 to .1512 reverse split, thereby reducing the number of its
	shares outstanding from 5,768,851 to 872,036. Each post-split share of the Predecessor was cancelled and exchanged for the right
	to receive 1.0667 shares of Pyxis common stock. Following the reverse merger, Pyxis had a total of 18,244,671 shares (giving effect
	to rounding up on fractional shares) of common stock issued and outstanding. (See

	Merger/Spin-off Reorganization Transaction

	 below)


	 


	LookSmart is a digital
	advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search and display advertising customers, organized along five
	lines of business: (i) Clickable, (ii) LookSmart AdCenter, (iii) Novatech.io, (iv) ShopWiki and (v) web searches. In addition,
	LookSmart formed a partnership with Conversion Media Holdings, LLC, which supports the Company’s other lines of business
	through the creation of content sites directed at ecommerce verticals. The Company operates its partnership and each line of business,
	while being related to the others in terms of shared resources, as separate business lines with their own core management, profits
	and losses, and the ability to operate independently as separate businesses. As a result, this separation of business lines allows
	Looksmart to operate effectively as a holding company and as a capital allocator to each of the Company’s separate businesses
	with the goal of finding mispriced assets in the public and private markets and subsequently taking those assets to create scalable
	and sustainable businesses that may then be monetized for the ultimate benefit of Looksmart’s stockholders.


	 



	Clickable



	 


	Clickable Inc., is
	a subsidiary of LookSmart and incorporated in Delaware. In September 2013, LookSmart Limited (“Predecessor”), through
	its wholly owned subsidiary LookSmart Canada Ltd., purchased the assets related to its Syncapse Inc. (“Syncapse”) technology
	for $3 million from MNP Ltd., a receiver appointed by Ontario Superior Court of Justice under an appointment order.  As a
	result of this transaction, the Predecessor acquired a social media platform that the Company believes has allowed it to quickly
	scale into social media analytics, publishing, and moderation. This, in turn, should allow our enterprise customers the ability
	to publish, monitor and analyze their social media presence on paid, owned and earned media.  In January 2014, LookSmart re-branded
	Syncapse as “Clickable.”


	 


	Clickable helps brands
	and agencies measure marketing ROI through a customer’s lifetime by connecting critical marketing and advertising products
	and services into one platform that gives customers the ability to analyze, publish, moderate, social media and search marketing.
	Clickable also offers its platform as a white label solution to agencies who use it to save hours of time creating reports,
	increase transparency to clients, increase stickiness of clients, increase recurring revenue streams, and upsell other tools and
	services. The Company has begun to work with large international brands to assist them in creating, maintaining and analyzing their
	social media presence online. The Company’s goal is to partner with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest
	and YouTube, as well as others, to provide vertically integrated solutions that will offer customers the ability to maximize their
	ad spend in all relevant ad categories.

	In addition, Clickable
	allows customers to manage paid, owned and earned media by providing a suite of solutions for social media marketers that include
	publishing, monitoring, data storage, compliance, management, ad placement and analytics.  The “Clickable Analytics”
	dashboard provides customers with the ability to easily put all of their cross channel marketing (search, display, social, email,
	video, offline) and audience data from various sources into one unified, flexible and customizable platform.  The platform
	allows the customer to better understand and utilize the data for the customizing and layering of customer specific key performance
	indicators.  The Company believes that this platform will allow customers to combine data in a way that better suits their
	particular marketing, financial and operational goals both with standard and customized dashboards and analytics.  This platform
	allows companies to gather and manage Application Programming Interface (“API”) data from many data providers that
	LookSmart aims to partner with, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, as well as analyze such data in the “Clickable”
	proprietary platform and within a company’s own data warehouse.


	 



	LookSmart AdCenter



	 


	We have developed a proprietary web-based
	advertising auction platform, the “AdCenter”, that allows us to create, track, analyze, report and optimize customers’
	advertising campaigns. Through the AdCenter platform, our customers are provided with search, social, display, mobile and video
	advertising solutions as well as analytic, moderation and publishing workflow solutions across the entire social media marketing
	ecosystem. The AdCenter indexes ads, analyzes webpage information to match advertising to relevant content, matches search queries
	to advertising and utilizes advanced fraud detection techniques in a high-volume ad serving environment. The platform also collects
	impression and click data for each listing that we manage for our customers and provides us with billing information. In addition,
	we provide each of our advertising customers with a password-protected online account that enables them to track, analyze and optimize
	their search marketing campaigns using online reports. The platform also includes an interface for publishers to access ad syndication
	feed reports and revenue information.


	 


	The advertisers that comprise the Company’s
	customer network include intermediaries, direct advertising customers and their agencies, as well as self-service customers in
	the United States and certain other countries. These AdCenter customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to large Fortune
	50 companies. Self-service advertisers are customers that sign-up directly online with the Company and pay by credit card. Direct
	advertisers (and their agencies) include customers whose main objective is to obtain conversions or sales from clicks. Intermediary
	customers do not directly advertise on our platform but sell into the affiliate networks of the large search engine providers.


	 


	Through a web interface or our proprietary
	API, LookSmart’s AdCenter allows multiple search advertising customers to upload keywords, manage daily budgets, set rates
	and view reports-including spend data that is updated hourly. Search advertising customers can also access keyword suggestions,
	price and traffic estimates, online help and frequently asked questions (“FAQ”). The AdCenter API is also available
	for search advertising customers and related agencies that use third-party or in-house systems to analyze and manage their search
	campaigns.


	 


	LookSmart's search advertising network
	generates advertisements that target search intent queries on Looksmart.com and partner publisher sites.  The network offers
	search advertising customers targeted search capability through a monitored search advertising distribution network.  LookSmart
	also offers advertisers the ability to buy graphical display advertising. LookSmart’s trading desk personnel utilize Demand
	Side Platform (“DSP”) technology and licensed data from third party providers to purchase targeted advertising on a
	real-time bidded basis. By leveraging our extensive historical search marketing network data along with performance data from a
	conversion pixel, LookSmart constructs models of the highest performing audiences and targets those audiences via the Company’s
	exchange inventory. LookSmart offers its trading desk as a managed service.


	  


	Further, LookSmart offers publishers licensed
	private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher Solutions”).
	Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers and portals
	to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	LookSmart offers a suite of customizable
	search advertising management tools and solutions that help publishers grow their audience, control advertiser relationships, and
	enhance and optimize the monetization of their sites. Our Publisher Solutions can be branded and configured according to publishers’
	needs. We offer publishers:

	Command and control over revenue diversification and growth via the AdCenter for Publishers, a

	Access to a “backfill” of advertisers so they can quickly ramp their online operations
	and not lose time or existing revenue sources while establishing their advertiser relationships. Connecting multiple installations
	of the AdCenter for Publishers together allows LookSmart to create an open marketplace environment that empowers publishers to
	share, leverage, and exchange their advertisers for expanded distribution.




	 



	Novatech.io



	 


	In November of 2013, LookSmart acquired
	an approximate 10,000 square foot Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona.  Looksmart has completed the process of consolidating
	its cloud services in the newly occupied and wholly owned secure Data Center.  As a result, the Company intends to expand
	its cloud-based offerings to its customers.


	 


	NovaTech's cloud based services include
	a private cloud ecosystem comprised of multi-vendor enterprise technologies and capabilities while serving as a production research
	and development environment to support the needs of companies who need to scale their information technology operations quickly
	and securely.


	 



	ShopWiki



	 


	ShopWiki is a consumer shopping search
	engine that offers a comprehensive results for both stores and products. ShopWiki uses crawling technology to find anything and
	everything on the internet.


	 


	It was founded by former DoubleClick Executives,
	along with a DoubleClick software developer. In January 2011, the Company was acquired by Oversee.net from whom Looksmart acquired
	the company.


	 


	ShopWiki does not sell any products, it
	simply help our users find any product available for sale on the Web. ShopWiki combines actively crawls the Internet and API feeds
	from merchants, to find and organize the widest selection of products from more than 250,000 online merchants.


	 



	Web Searches



	 


	The Company offers a LookSmart-branded
	search engine.  For parties submitting search queries, the Company offers free-of-charge search results ranked and presented
	based on proprietary algorithms.   While early in its evolution, part of the Company's current search engine monetization
	strategy is to generate sponsored search results as a part of overall search results and provide links to paying advertisers’
	websites.


	 



	Conversion Media



	 


	In March 2014, the Company formed a joint
	venture, Conversion Media Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, with VisionNexus, LLC, a California limited
	liability company. LookSmart owns 51% of the joint venture, with VisionNexus owning 49% of the venture. The Company entered into
	the joint venture in order to create content sites directed at ecommerce verticals like housewares, electronics and other consumer
	products.   The operations of the joint venture began in April of 2014 and currently are in a testing phase.


	 



	Competition



	 


	The online advertising industry is constantly
	evolving, changes rapidly and is highly competitive. One of the major factors contributing to this competitive environment is that
	providers of all online advertising formats compete for a share of the advertisers’ limited advertising budgets. The large
	search engines, such as Yahoo!, Google, and Bing often receive the biggest portion of the search marketing budget. In addition,
	social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn are rapidly scaling their advertising capabilities. With greater capital and technical
	resources, and greater brand recognition, the larger brands are often first priority in the mind of the advertiser, agency or buyer.


	 






	 



	6



	 







	 




	 


	We compete on two main fronts: 1) attracting
	and growing our base of advertising customers to purchase our online advertising products and to incorporate their key words into
	our search advertising network, and 2) attracting and maintaining distribution network partners to incorporate their search queries
	into our search advertising network. The basis on which we compete differs among the two fronts. In addition, while online advertising
	continues to grow year over year, customers’ online advertising budgets are in competition with advertising in other media
	such as television, radio and print. 


	 



	Customers



	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2015, our
	largest customer accounted for 12% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our largest customer accounted for 12%
	of our revenue.


	 



	Intellectual Property



	 


	We rely on a combination of patent, trade
	secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our
	trademarks include LookSmart ®, Clickable ® and Syncapse ®. We have an issued patent on our search engine technology
	and have patents on various aspects of our ad delivery and search technologies. 


	 



	Government Regulations



	 


	We are subject to a number of domestic
	state and federal laws that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. In addition, because of the increasing popularity
	of the Internet and the growth of online services, laws relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising,
	information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption.


	 


	In the U.S., state and federal laws relating
	to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their consumers, and the liability of providers of online advertiser’s
	ads and activities, are currently being tested by a number of claims, which include actions for defamation, libel, invasion of
	privacy and other data protection claims, tort, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based
	on the nature and content of the materials searched by consumers, the advertisements shown to consumers or the content generated
	by consumers. Likewise, other federal laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the Children’s Online Protection
	Act and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children
	and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In addition, the Protection
	of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child
	pornography laws under certain circumstances.


	 


	In addition, the application of existing
	laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our search advertising customers, including, for example, distribution
	of pharmaceuticals, adult content, online gambling, financial services, alcohol or firearms, can be unclear. Application of these
	laws in an unanticipated manner could expose us to substantial liability and restrict our ability to deliver services to our customers. 


	 



	Research, Product Development and Technical Operations Expense




	 




	Research,
	product development and technical operations expense includes all costs related to the continued operation, development and enhancement
	of our Clickable and AdCenter platforms. Our product development and technical operations expense for Clickable, net of capitalized
	software development costs, was approximately $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately $2.0 million
	during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our product development and technical operations expense for Adcenter, net of capitalized
	software development costs, was approximately $0.5 million_ during the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately $3.5 million
	during the year ended December 31, 2014.




	 



	The Company reviews assets for evidence
	of impairment annually at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
	The impairment review requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows, as well as
	other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions,
	changes in business operations and changes in competition.


	  


	The fair value of the long-lived assets
	was derived based on Level 3 inputs, which are based on significant inputs that are not observable. The fair value of the capitalized
	software long-lived assets was determined using an income approach, based on expected future cash flows and market considerations.
	The fair value of the computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, software and leasehold improvements long-lived assets was determined
	using a market approach, based on comparable fair values of similar assets.


	 


	The Company expects to continue to invest in internally developed
	software and other technology initiatives.

	RISK FACTORS





	 


	You should carefully consider the risks
	described below before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the following events described as a
	company risk factor actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case,
	the trading price of our common stock could decline and our investors could lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks
	not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.



	 




	Risks Related to our Business




	 




	Our financial results are highly concentrated
	in the online search advertising business; if we are unable to grow online search advertising revenues and find alternative sources
	of revenue, our financial results will suffer.



	 


	Search advertising accounted for substantially
	all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our success depends upon search advertising customers choosing
	to use, and distribution network partners choosing to distribute, our search advertising networks products. Decisions by search
	advertising customers and distribution network partners not to adopt our products at projected rates, or changes in market conditions,
	may adversely affect the use or distribution of search advertisements. Because of our revenue concentration in the online search
	advertising business, such shortfalls or changes could have a negative impact on our financial results. Also, many of our products
	are offered to website publishers who use them to display or generate revenue from their online advertisements. If we are unable
	to generate significant revenue from our online advertising business or related business models under development, or if market
	conditions adversely affect the use or distribution of online advertisements generally, or for some of our larger customers specifically,
	our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity will suffer.



	 




	Our largest category of customers have
	historically been Intermediaries, the majority of whom purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search engine
	providers. In 2014, we experienced a further decrease in revenues due to loss of Intermediary business.



	 


	We operate in a large online search advertising
	ecosystem serving ads that target user queries on partner sites. We operate in the middle of this ecosystem, acquiring search queries
	from a variety of sources and matching them with the keywords of our search advertising customers. Our largest category of customers
	has historically been Intermediaries, the majority of which purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search
	engine providers. The Intermediary business model experienced a significant change in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Since then,
	we have seen our revenues from Intermediaries decreasing from prior levels, and have ceased business with a number of our Intermediary
	customers. We do not expect significant future revenue growth in this area. If we are unable to identify and exploit alternative
	sources of profitable revenue, our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity will suffer.



	 




	Our future success depends on sales
	to, and the management of, international customers.



	 


	A portion of our revenue is derived from
	sales to international customers who are headquartered internationally, however our business with them is primarily U.S. based
	and our transactions are primarily in U.S. dollars.

	Managing our growing group of customers

	our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business.




	  


	To date,
	foreign exchange exposure from sales has not been material to our operations. Our activities with customers outside the United
	States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting
	trade and investment, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments. In addition, the
	laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United
	States, which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies. Our business could be materially adversely affected
	if foreign markets do not continue to develop, if we do not receive additional traffic suitable for our foreign accounts or if
	regulations governing our international businesses change.



	 




	We rely primarily on our distribution
	network partners to generate quality search queries and display advertisements that generate paid clicks; if we are unable to maintain
	or expand the scope and quality of this network, our ability to generate revenue may be seriously harmed.



	 


	The success of our online search advertisement
	products depends in large part on the size and quality of our distribution network of search queries. We may be unable to maintain
	or add partners of satisfactory quality in our distribution network at reasonable revenue-sharing rates, if at all. If we lose
	any significant portion of our distribution network, we would need to find alternative sources of quality click traffic to replace
	the lost paid clicks. In the past, we have lost portions of our distribution network and chose to remove those with poor quality.
	Although alternate sources of click traffic are currently available in the market, they may not be available at reasonable prices
	or may be of unacceptable quality. There is significant competition among advertising networks to sign agreements with traffic
	providers. We may be unable to negotiate and sign agreements with quality traffic providers on favorable terms, if at all. In order
	to attract higher quality traffic, we may have to pay high traffic acquisition costs which may adversely affect our gross margin
	and other financial results. If we are unable to attract higher quality traffic, or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in maintaining
	and expanding our distribution network, then our ability to generate revenue may be seriously harmed.



	 




	We generated net losses in 2015 and
	2014, have had losses in the past, and may have further losses in the future. Failure to maintain operating profitability could
	harm our business and result in a decline in our stock price.



	 



	We
	had a net loss of $3.2 million in 2015 and $6.4 million in 201

	4. We may be unable to achieve profitability in the foreseeable
	future. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend on our ability to generate additional revenue and contain
	our expenses. In order to generate additional revenue, we will need to expand our network of distribution network partners, increase
	the amount our search advertising customers spend on our advertising network, expand our advertiser base, experience an increase
	in paid clicks across our network and publisher products and develop and implement successful new digital advertising revenue generating
	models. We may be unable to accomplish some or any of these goals because of the risks identified in this report or for unforeseen
	reasons. Also, we may be unable to contain our costs due to the need to make revenue sharing payments to our distribution network
	partners, to invest in product development and to market our products. Historically, our operating expenses have increased in proportion
	to our revenue. Operating expenses may increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that our revenue grows and as we increase
	headcount, particularly our sales and technology-related headcount, incur general and administrative expenses associated with being
	a public company and expand our facilities. Additionally, our acquisition-related costs may increase if we pursue additional acquisition
	opportunities. Although we expect to achieve operating efficiencies and greater leverage of resources as we grow, because of the
	foregoing factors, and others outlined in this report, we may be unable to achieve profitability in the future, which could result
	in a decline in our stock price.

	If we experience decreases to our match
	rate and/or revenue-per-click, or we are unable to rebuild our match rate, and/or revenue-per-click, our financial results may
	suffer.



	 


	We have experienced, and may continue to
	experience in the future, decreases in our average revenue-per-click (“RPC”) and average match rate, which is the rate
	at which our paid listings are matched against search queries from distribution network partners. Future decreases in RPC or average
	match rate may occur for a variety of reasons, including a change in customer mix, the erosion of our advertiser base, a reduction
	in average advertiser spend, a reduction in the number of listings purchased by search advertising customers, a lower number of
	bids on keywords, changes in the composition of our distribution network or for other reasons. If our RPC or average match rate
	falls for any reason, or if we are unable to grow our RPC and average match rate, then we may be unable to achieve our financial
	projections and our stock price would likely suffer.



	 




	Our growth depends on our ability to
	retain and grow our search advertising customer base; if our search advertising customer base and average search advertising customer
	spend falls, our financial results will suffer.



	 


	Our growth depends on our ability to build
	a search advertising customer base that corresponds with the characteristics of our distribution network. Our distribution network,
	which currently consists of a diversified set of distribution sources, may change as new distribution sources are added and old
	distribution sources are removed. Search advertising customers may view these changes to the distribution network negatively, and
	existing or potential search advertising customers may elect to purchase fewer or no advertisements for display on our distribution
	network. If this occurs, it is likely that our average RPC and average match rate may decline and our stock price would likely
	suffer.



	 




	We have launched a solution that is
	dependent on our customers’ use of search advertising. Any decrease in the use of search advertising or our inability to
	further penetrate mobile, social and display advertising channels would harm our business, growth prospects, operating results
	and financial condition.



	 


	We expect that search advertising will
	become a channel increasingly used by our customers in the foreseeable future. Should our customers lose confidence in the value
	or effectiveness of search advertising, the demand for our solutions may decline, which would harm our growth prospects, operating
	results and financial condition.



	 




	If we cannot increase the capacity of
	our advertising technology platform to meet advertiser demand, our business will be harmed.



	 


	We must be able to continue to increase
	the capacity of our technology platforms in order to support substantial increases in the number of advertisers, to support an
	increasing variety of advertising formats and to maintain a stable service infrastructure and reliable service delivery for advertising
	campaigns. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively increase the scale of our advertising platforms to support and manage
	a substantial increase in the number of advertisers, while also maintaining a high level of performance, the quality of our services
	could decline and our reputation and business could be seriously harmed. In addition, if we are not able to support emerging advertising
	formats or services preferred by advertisers, we may be unable to obtain new advertising clients or may lose existing advertising
	customers, and in either case our revenue could decline.



	 




	The market for digital advertising is
	relatively new and dependent on growth in various digital advertising channels. If this market develops more slowly or differently
	than we expect, our business, growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected.



	 


	The market for digital advertising products
	such as ours is relatively new and these products may not achieve or sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. While
	search and display advertising has been used successfully for several years, marketing via new digital advertising channels such
	as social media is not as well established. The future growth of our business could be constrained by the level of acceptance and
	expansion of emerging digital advertising channels, as well as the continued use and growth of existing channels, such as search
	and display advertising. Even if these channels become widely adopted, advertisers and agencies may not make significant investments
	in solutions such as ours that help them manage their digital advertising spend across publisher platforms and advertising channels.
	It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates, customer demand for our platform, the future growth rate and size of the digital
	advertising market or the entry of competitive products. Any expansion of the market for digital advertising management solutions
	depends on a number of factors, including the growth of the digital advertising market, the growth of social as an advertising
	channel and the cost, performance and perceived value associated with digital advertising management solutions. If our digital
	advertising products, including those in the social media space, do not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in
	demand for digital advertising caused by weakening economic conditions, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could
	result in reduced usage, which could decrease revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business.



	 




	Our business depends on our ability
	to maintain the quality of our advertiser and developer content.



	 


	We must be able to ensure that our customers’
	ads are not placed in publisher content that is unlawful or inappropriate. Likewise, publishers rely upon us not to distribute
	ads that are unlawful or inappropriate. If we are unable to ensure that the quality of our advertiser and publisher content does
	not decline as the number of advertisers and publishers we work with continues to grow, then our reputation and business may suffer.

	If we are unable to attract new advertising
	customers and sell additional offerings to our existing customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.



	 


	To sustain or increase our revenue, we
	must add new advertisers and encourage existing advertisers (both of which are often represented by advertising agencies or other
	Intermediaries), to purchase additional offerings from us. As the digital advertising industry matures and as competitors introduce
	lower cost or differentiated products or services that compete with or are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell
	our solution to new and existing advertisers based on our offerings, pricing, technology platform and functionality could be impaired.
	Some advertisers that are repeat users of our solution tend to increase their spend over time. Conversely, some advertisers that
	are newer to our solution tend to spend less than, and may not return as frequently as, advertisers who have used our solution
	for longer periods of time. If we fail to retain or cultivate the spending of our newer, lower-spending advertisers, it will be
	difficult for us to sustain and grow our revenue from existing advertisers. Even with long-time advertisers, we may reach a point
	of saturation at which we cannot continue to grow our revenue from those advertisers because of internal limits that advertisers
	may place on the allocation of their advertising budgets to digital media, to particular campaigns, to a particular provider, or
	for other reasons not known to us. If we are unable to attract new advertisers or obtain new business from existing advertisers,
	our revenue growth and our business may be adversely affected.



	  




	If we do not introduce new and upgraded
	products and services and successfully adapt to our rapidly changing industry, our financial condition may suffer.



	 


	The online search advertising industry
	continues to evolve and we will need to continue developing new and upgraded products and services, and adapt to new business environments
	and competition in order to maintain and grow revenue and reach our profitability goals. New search advertising technologies could
	emerge that make our services comparatively less useful or new business methods could emerge that divert web traffic away from
	our advertising network. In addition, competition from other web businesses may prevent us from attracting substantial traffic
	to our services. We may inaccurately predict trends in the online search advertising market, which could lead us to make investments
	in technologies and products that do not generate sufficient returns. We may face platform and resource constraints that prevent
	us from developing upgraded products and services. We may fail to successfully identify new products or services, or fail to bring
	new products or services to market in a timely and efficient manner. Rapid industry change makes it difficult for us to accurately
	anticipate customer needs for our products, particularly over longer periods.



	 




	We may not be able to compete successfully
	against current and future competitors because competition in our industry is intense, and our competitors may offer solutions
	that are perceived by our customers to be more attractive than ours. These factors could result in declining revenue, or inability
	to grow our business.



	 


	Competition for our advertiser customers’
	advertising budgets is intense. We also expect competition to increase as the barriers to enter our market are low. Increased competition
	may force us to charge less for our solution, or offer pricing models that are less attractive to us and decrease our margins.
	Our principal competitors include companies that offer demand side and data management platforms that allow advertisers to purchase
	inventory directly from advertising exchanges or other third parties and manage and analyze their own consumer data, traditional
	advertising networks and advertising agencies themselves. We compete with large companies that provide paid placement products,
	paid inclusion products, and other forms of search marketing as well as contextually-targeted advertising products and other types
	of online advertisements. We compete for search advertising customers on the basis of the quality and composition of our network,
	the price-per-click (“PPC”) charged to search advertising customers, the volume of clicks that we can deliver to search
	advertising customers, tracking and reporting of campaign results, customer service, and other factors. We also compete for distribution
	network partners and for ad placement on those partners’ sites on the basis of the relevance of our ads and the PPC charged
	to search advertising customers. We also experience competition in offering our publisher products to website publishers. Some
	of our competitors have larger distribution networks and proprietary traffic bases, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition,
	higher RPC, better relevance and conversion rates, or better products and services than we have.


	 


	We compete with companies, such as Google,
	which are significantly larger than us and have more capital to invest in their advertising businesses. We also compete with in-house
	solutions used by companies who choose to coordinate advertising across their own properties, such as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!
	and Pandora. They, or other companies that offer competing advertising solutions, may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships
	with their partners, brand advertisers, app developers or other parties, thereby limiting our ability to promote our services and
	generate revenue. Competitors could also seek to gain market share from us by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers or
	by introducing new technology tools for developers. Moreover, increased competition for online advertising space from developers
	could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to developers to acquire that advertising space.

	Our business will suffer to the extent
	that our Intermediary and advertiser customers purchase and sell advertising directly from each other or through other companies
	that are able to become Intermediaries. For example, we are aware of companies that have substantial existing platforms for developers
	who had previously not heavily used those platforms for advertising campaigns. These companies could compete with us to the extent
	they expand into advertising. Other companies, such as large app developers with a substantial advertising business, may decide
	to directly monetize some or all of their advertising space without utilizing our services. Other companies that offer analytics,
	mediation, exchange or other third party services may also become Intermediaries between advertisers and publishers and thereby
	compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our services and could result in increased
	pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.



	 




	We have previously derived a portion
	of our revenues from display advertising. A decrease in the use of display advertising, or our inability to further penetrate display,
	search, and social advertising channels would harm our business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.



	 


	Historically, we have had customers use
	our solution for display advertising. We expect that display advertising will continue to be a significant channel used by our
	customers. Recently, the market for display advertising, excluding social, has been declining as overall display advertising growth
	has been driven by mobile, social and video advertising. Should our customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of
	display advertising, the demand for our display solution could decline. In addition, our failure to achieve market acceptance of
	our solution for social advertising would harm our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations.



	 




	We do not have long-term commitments
	from our advertisers, and we may not be able to retain advertisers or attract new advertisers that provide us with revenue that
	is comparable to the revenue generated by any advertisers we may lose.



	 


	Most of our advertisers do business with
	us by placing insertion orders for particular advertising campaigns. If we perform well on a particular campaign, then the advertiser,
	or most often, the advertising agency representing the advertiser, may place new insertion orders with us for additional advertising
	campaigns. We rarely have any commitment from an advertiser beyond the campaign governed by a particular insertion order. As a
	result, our success is dependent upon our ability to outperform our competitors and win repeat business from existing advertisers,
	while continually expanding the number of advertisers for whom we provide services. In addition, it is relatively easy for advertisers
	and the advertising agencies that represent them to seek an alternative provider for their advertising campaigns because there
	are no significant switching costs. Agencies, with whom we do the majority of our business, often have relationships with many
	different providers, each of whom may be running portions of the same advertising campaign. Because we generally do not have long-term
	contracts, it may be difficult for us to accurately predict future revenue streams. We cannot provide assurance that our current
	advertisers will continue to use our solution, or that we will be able to replace departing advertisers with new advertisers that
	provide us with comparable revenue.



	 




	If we serve our advertisers’ advertisements
	on undesirable websites, our reputation will suffer, which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business,
	financial condition and results of operations.



	 


	Our business depends in part on providing
	advertisers with a service that they trust. We take action in an effort to prevent advertisements from appearing on undesirable
	websites. We may distribute advertising to inventory that is objectionable to advertisers, and we may lose the trust of our advertiser
	customers, which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 




	If our access to quality advertising
	inventory is diminished or if we fail to have access to new advertising inventory, our revenue could decline and our growth could
	be impeded.



	 


	We must maintain a consistent supply of
	attractive advertising inventory, meaning the digital space on which we place advertising impressions, including websites, proprietary
	social networks, such as Facebook, and mobile applications. Our success depends on our ability to secure quality inventory on reasonable
	terms across a broad range of advertising networks and exchanges, including real time advertising exchanges, such as Google’s
	DoubleClick Ad Exchange or AppNexus; suppliers of video and mobile inventory; and social media platforms, such as the Facebook
	Exchange, known as FBX.


	 


	The amount, quality and cost of inventory
	available to us can change at any time. Our suppliers are generally not bound by long-term contracts. As a result, we cannot provide
	any assurance that we will have access to a consistent supply of quality inventory. Moreover, the number of competing intermediaries
	that purchase advertising inventory from real-time advertising exchanges continues to increase, which could put upward pressure
	on inventory costs. If we are unable to compete favorably for advertising inventory available on real-time advertising exchanges,
	or if real-time advertising exchanges decide not to make their advertising inventory available to us, we may not be able to place
	advertisements at competitive rates or find alternative sources of inventory with comparable traffic patterns and consumer demographics
	in a timely manner. Furthermore, the inventory that we can access through real-time advertising exchanges may be of low quality
	or misrepresented to us, despite attempts by us and our suppliers to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks.

	Suppliers control the bidding process for
	the inventory they supply, and their processes may not always work in our favor. For example, suppliers may place restrictions
	on the use of their inventory, including restrictions that prohibit the placement of advertisements on behalf of certain advertisers.
	Through the bidding process, we may not win the right to deliver advertising to the inventory that we select and may not be able
	to replace inventory that is no longer made available to us.


	 


	If we are unable to maintain a consistent
	supply of quality inventory for any reason, our business, advertiser retention and loyalty, financial condition and results of
	operations would be harmed.



	 




	If our access to quality inventory in
	social media is diminished or if we fail to acquire new advertising inventory in social media, our growth could be impeded and
	our revenue could decline.



	 


	If we are unable to compete favorably for
	advertising inventory on Facebook’s FBX, our social media offering may not be successful. Also, we cannot provide assurance
	that Facebook will continue to make its advertising inventory available to us upon reasonable terms or at all, and we may not be
	able to replace the FBX advertising inventory with inventory that meets our advertisers’ specific goals with respect to social
	media. In addition, advertisers may prefer to work with companies that provide advertising on social media platforms other than
	FBX or that have a longer history of integration with social media platforms. If we are unable to run advertising campaigns on
	the FBX platform, integrate with social media platforms that may become available in the future or find alternative sources of
	quality social media inventory, our business could be harmed.



	 

	 



	If mobile connected devices, their operating
	systems or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent our advertising
	campaigns from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.



	 


	Our success in the mobile channel depends
	upon the ability of our technology platform to integrate with mobile inventory suppliers and provide advertising for most mobile
	connected devices, as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the thousands of applications that are downloaded
	onto them. The design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties with whom we do not have any formal
	relationships. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or
	modify existing ones. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices. If our solution
	were unable to work on these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because an operating
	system or app developer, device maker or carrier wished to impair our ability to purchase inventory and provide advertisements,
	our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed.



	 




	If we do not deliver quality traffic
	that delivers value for advertisers, then our advertisers and our advertising partners may pay us less for their listing or discontinue
	listing with us altogether.



	 


	For our services to be successful, we need
	to deliver consumers to advertisers’ websites that are valuable to such advertiser. If we do not meet advertisers’
	expectations by delivering quality traffic, then our advertising partners may pay us less per click or cease doing business with
	us altogether, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. We compete with other web search services, online
	publishers and high-traffic websites, as well as traditional media such as television, radio and print, for a share of our advertisers’
	total advertising expenditures. Many potential advertisers and advertising agencies have only limited experience advertising on
	the Internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to search advertising. Acceptance of
	our advertising offerings among our advertisers and advertising partners will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness
	and the continued growth of commercial usage of the Internet. If we experience downward pricing pressure for our services in the
	future, our financial results may suffer.



	 




	We depend on publishers for advertising
	space to deliver our advertiser customers’ advertising campaigns, and any decline in the supply of advertising inventory
	from these publishers could hurt our business.



	 


	We depend on publishers, both search and
	social media, to provide us with space (advertising inventory) into which to distribute advertisements. There is no contractually
	bound obligation to make advertising inventory available to us or our customers, or to provide us with a consistent supply of advertising
	inventory. Furthermore, there are tools that exist that parties could use which could result in pressure to increase the prices
	paid to publishers for that inventory or to otherwise block access to this inventory, without which we would be unable to facilitate
	the distribution of ads on behalf of our advertiser customers.

	advertising space available to our competitors who offer ads to them on more favorable economic terms. In addition, publishers
	may place significant restrictions on use of their advertising inventory. These restrictions may prohibit ads from specific advertisers
	or specific industries, or they could restrict the use of specified creative content or format. Publishers may also use a fee-based
	or subscription-based business model to generate revenue from their content, in lieu of or to reduce their reliance on ads.


	 


	If publishers decide not to make advertising
	inventory available to us for any of these reasons, decide to increase the price of inventory, or place significant restrictions
	on our use of their advertising space, we may not be able to replace this with inventory from other publishers that satisfy our
	requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. If this happens, our revenue could decline or our cost of acquiring inventory
	could increase.



	 




	We do not have long-term agreements
	with our advertiser customers, and we may be unable to retain key customers, attract new customers or replace departing customers
	with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us.



	 


	Our success requires us to maintain and
	expand our current advertiser customer relationships and to develop new relationships. Our contracts with our advertiser customers
	generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our services and are cancelable upon short or no notice
	and without penalty. As a result, we may have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams. We cannot assure
	you that our advertiser customers will continue to use our services or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective
	manner, departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue. If a major advertising customer representing a
	significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our platform or to cease using our platform altogether,
	our revenue could be significantly reduced. Advertisers in general may shift their business to a competitor’s platform because
	of new or more compelling offerings, strategic relationships, technological developments, pricing and other financial considerations,
	or a variety of other reasons, which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and harm our business.



	 




	Our acquisition of businesses and technologies
	may be costly and time-consuming; acquisitions may also dilute our existing stockholders.



	 


	From time to time we evaluate strategic
	corporate development opportunities and when appropriate, may make acquisitions of or significant investments in complementary
	companies or technologies to increase our technological capabilities expand our service offerings, or extend the operating scale
	of our network businesses. The pursuit of acquisitions, whether or not completed, as well as the completion of any acquisitions
	and their integration may be expensive and may divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of the company.
	It may be difficult to retain key management and technical personnel of the acquired company during the transition period following
	an acquisition. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in dilution to our existing stockholders if we issue
	additional equity securities or increase our debt to pay for such acquisitions. We may also be required to amortize significant
	amounts of intangible assets, record impairment of goodwill in connection with future acquisitions, or divest non-performing assets
	at below-market prices, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. Integration of acquired companies and technologies
	into the company is likely to be expensive, time-consuming, and strain our managerial resources. We may not be successful in integrating
	any acquired businesses or technologies and these transactions may not achieve anticipated business benefits.


	 



	If we fail to make the right investment
	decisions in our offerings and technology platform, we may not attract and retain advertisers and advertising agencies and our
	revenue and results of operations may decline.



	 


	We compete for advertisers, which are often
	represented by advertising agencies, who want to purchase digital media for advertising campaigns. Our industry is subject to rapid
	changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as in advertiser demands and expectations. We continuously
	need to make decisions regarding which offerings and technology to invest in to meet advertiser demand and evolving industry standards
	and regulatory requirements. We may make wrong decisions regarding these investments. For example, we expect advertisers to award
	us credit, or attribution, for impressions that generate specific consumer purchases or responses using certain criteria such as
	last ad clicked or viewed. Our technology considers these attribution models and if new attribution models are introduced by advertisers,
	we may need to make changes in our technology. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings, we may lose advertisers
	or advertisers may decrease their spending on our solution. New advertiser demands, superior competitive offerings or new industry
	standards could render our existing solution unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated
	changes to our technology platform or business model. Our failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or to anticipate advertiser
	demand could harm our business and our financial performance.

	Our acquisition of Syncapse and ShopWiki could have a negative
	impact on our business, or on our stock price.



	 


	On September 3, 2013, we purchased the
	assets of Syncapse, Inc. (“Syncapse”) and on December 17th, 2014, we acquired ShopWiki. This acquisition could disrupt
	our business in the following ways, any of which could negatively affect our stock price or could harm our financial condition,
	results of operations or business prospects:


	 







	●



	our customers and other third party business partners may seek to terminate or renegotiate their
	relationships as a result of our acquisition of Syncapse, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements or otherwise;




	 







	●



	the attention of our management may be directed toward the integration of our businesses and related
	matters and may be diverted from our current business operations, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial
	to us; and




	 







	●



	current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with
	our company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel. 




	 



	We may be unable to realize the benefits
	anticipated by the acquisition, including estimated cost savings and synergies, or it may take longer than we anticipate for us
	to achieve those benefits.



	 


	Our realization of the benefits anticipated
	as a result of the acquisition of the assets of Syncapse will depend in part on the integration and development of Syncapse’s
	assets with ours. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate a business using the Syncapse’s assets
	profitably or integrate it successfully into our operations in a timely fashion, or at all. Following the acquisition, the size
	of the combined company’s business is significantly larger than our business was prior to the acquisition. Our future success
	as a combined company depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges
	for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs
	and complexity. The dedication of management resources to this integration could detract attention from our current day-to-day
	business, and we cannot assure you that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or other negative
	consequences as a result of these integration efforts. These effects, including, but not limited to, incurring unexpected costs
	or delays in connection with integration of the two businesses, or the failure of the business created using Syncapse’s assets
	to perform as expected, could harm our results of operations.


	 



	If we fail to develop widespread brand
	awareness cost-effectively, our business may suffer.



	 


	We believe that developing and maintaining
	widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and
	attracting new customers. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a result of our marketing and brand promotion activities.
	We may not generate customer awareness or increase revenues enough to offset the increased expenses we incur in building our brand.
	If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial marketing and sales expenses, which are not offset
	by increased revenues, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building
	efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is essential for broad customer adoption of our solution.


	 



	Failure to adequately manage our growth
	may seriously harm our business.



	 


	We have in the past experienced, and may
	again in the future experience, significant growth in our business. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of
	our services may suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services. Our growth has placed, and is
	expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational and financial resources and
	our infrastructure. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively.
	This will require us to, among other things:


	 







	●



	implement additional management information systems;




	 







	●



	further develop our operating, administrative, legal, financial and accounting systems and controls;




	 







	●



	hire additional personnel;




	 







	●



	develop additional levels of management within our company;




	 







	●



	locate additional office space;




	 







	●



	maintain close coordination among our engineering, operations, legal, finance, sales and marketing
	and client service and support organizations; and

	●



	manage our expanding international operations. 




	 


	Moreover, as our sales increase, we may
	be required to concurrently deploy our services infrastructure at multiple additional locations or provide increased levels of
	customization. As a result, we may lack the resources to deploy our services on a timely and cost-effective basis. Failure to accomplish
	any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver our mobile advertising platform in a timely fashion, fulfill existing
	client commitments or attract and retain new clients.



	 




	Our success depends on our ability to
	attract and retain key personnel; if we were unable to attract and retain key personnel in the future, our business could be materially
	and adversely impacted.



	 


	Our success depends on our ability to identify,
	attract, retain and motivate highly skilled development, technical, sales, and management personnel. We have a limited number of
	key development, technical, sales and management personnel performing critical company functions, and the loss of the services
	of any of our key employees, particularly any of our executive team members or key technical personnel, could adversely affect
	our business. The combination of stock volatility of Company stock and the Company’s small market capitalization may not
	allow us to offer competitive equity based compensation to attract and retain key personnel.



	  




	If we do not attract additional sales
	and technology talent, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.



	 


	Our future success also depends on our
	ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled managers and employees, particularly employees with technical
	skills that enable us to deliver effective mobile advertising solutions and sales, and client support representatives with experience
	in mobile and other digital advertising and strong relationships with brand advertisers and app developers. Competition for these
	employees in our industry is intense. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain these management, technical, sales and
	client support personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our key client relationships, loss of key information,
	expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. The loss of the services of our senior management or other
	key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.



	 




	We face capacity constraints on our
	software and infrastructure systems that may be costly and time-consuming to resolve.



	 


	We use proprietary and licensed software
	and databases to receive and analyze advertisements, campaigns and budgets, match search queries to advertising, analyze webpage
	information to match advertising to relevant content, integrate third-party ads, detect invalid clicks, serve ads in high volume,
	and track, analyze and report on advertising responses and campaigns. Any of these software systems may contain undetected errors,
	defects or bugs, or may fail to operate with other software applications. The following developments may strain our capacity and
	result in technical difficulties with our service or the websites of our distribution network partners:


	 







	●



	customization of our matching algorithms and ad serving technologies,




	 







	●



	substantial increases in the number of queries to our database,

	substantial increases in the number of searches in our advertising databases, or




	 







	●



	the addition of new products or new features or changes to our products. 




	 


	If we experience difficulties with our
	software and infrastructure systems or if we fail to address these difficulties in a timely manner, we may lose the confidence
	of search advertisers and distribution network partners, our revenue may decline and our business could suffer. In addition, as
	we expand our service offerings and enter into new business areas, we may be required to significantly modify and expand our software
	and infrastructure systems. If we fail to accomplish these tasks in a timely manner, our business will likely suffer.

	Our inability to use software licensed
	from third parties, or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights, could disrupt
	our business.



	 


	Our technology platform incorporates software
	licensed from third parties, including some software, known as open source software, which we use without charge. Although we monitor
	our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S.
	or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions
	or restrictions on our ability to provide our platform to our clients. While we monitor our use of open source software and try
	to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms
	of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third
	parties in order to continue offering our platform, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or
	at all. Alternatively, we may need to re-engineer our platform or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by
	our platform. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using
	such software to others on unfavorable license terms. We may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for
	breach of contract, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial
	action that may divert resources away from our development efforts. Our inability to use third party software could result in disruptions
	to our business, or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings, which could impair our
	business.



	 




	If we fail to maintain adequate security
	and supporting infrastructure as we scale our systems, we may experience outages and disruptions of our services which could harm
	our brand and reputation and negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.



	 


	As we grow our business, we expect to continue
	to further invest in technology services, hardware and software, including data centers, network services, storage and database
	technologies. Creating the appropriate support for our technology platform, including Big Data and our computational infrastructure,
	is expensive and complex, and our execution could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability
	to cyber-attacks, which, in turn, could diminish the quality of our services and our performance for advertisers. The steps we
	take to increase the reliability, integrity and security of our systems as they scale may be expensive and may not prevent system
	failures or unintended vulnerabilities resulting from the increasing number of persons with access to our systems, complex interactions
	within our technology platform and the increasing number of connections with third party partners and vendors’ technology.
	Operational errors or failures or successful cyber-attacks could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and new
	advertisers and other business partners which could harm our business. In addition, we could be adversely impacted by outages and
	disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners, such as the real-time advertising exchanges, who we rely upon
	for access to inventory.


	 


	Our Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona
	is vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods,
	fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events.
	Moreover, while we have a disaster recovery plan in place, we do not maintain a “hot failover” instance of our software
	platform permitting us to immediately switch over in the event of damage or service interruption at our Data Center. The occurrence
	of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, any outages or vandalism or other misconduct, or a decision to close the facility
	without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.


	 


	Any changes in service levels at the facility
	or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to the facility that affect our services could
	harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues, subject
	us to potential liability, or result in reduced usage of our platform. In addition, some of our customer contracts require us to
	issue credits for downtime in excess of certain levels and in some instances give our customers the ability to terminate their
	subscriptions.



	 




	Our data and information systems and
	network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats. If our security measures are breached and an
	unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information, our information systems may be
	perceived as being unsecure, which could harm our business and reputation, and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated
	which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



	 


	In our operations, we store and transmit
	our proprietary information and information related to our customers. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity
	of our facilities and operations. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable
	to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure
	of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security
	measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Since techniques
	used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until
	launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance
	of such an attack on our systems. In addition, if we select a vendor that uses cyber or “cloud” storage of information
	as part of their service or product offerings, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary
	information may be misappropriated by third parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security
	of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer
	damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally,
	misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.

	Errors or failures in our software and
	systems could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.



	 


	We depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted
	performance of our technology platform to operate over 1,000 campaigns at any given time; manage our inventory supply; bid on inventory
	for each campaign; serve or direct a third party to serve advertising; collect, process and interpret data to optimize campaign
	performance in real time; and provide billing information to our financial systems. If our technology platform cannot scale to
	meet demand, or if there are errors in our execution of any of these functions on our platform, then our business could be harmed.
	Because our software is complex, undetected errors and failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. We
	do not have the capability to test new releases or updates to our code on a small subset of campaigns, which means that bugs or
	errors in code could impact all campaigns on our platform. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our software have in the past,
	and may in the future, not be found until the software is in our live operating environment. For example, we may experience failures
	in our bidding system to recognize or respond to budget restrictions for campaigns, resulting in overspending on media, and we
	may in the future have failures in our systems that cause us to buy more media than our advertisers are contractually obligated
	to pay for, which could be costly and harm our operating results. Errors or failures in our software could also result in negative
	publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solution, increased costs or loss of
	revenue, loss of competitive position or claims by advertisers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required
	or choose to expend additional resources to help mitigate any problems resulting from errors in our software. We may make errors
	in the measurement of our campaigns causing discrepancies with our advertisers’ measurements leading to a lack in confidence
	with us or, on occasion, the need for advertiser “make-goods,” the standard credits given to advertisers for campaigns
	that have not been delivered properly. Alleviating problems resulting from errors in our software could require significant expenditures
	of capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or the cessation of our business, any of which would adversely
	impact our financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.



	 




	Software and components that we incorporate
	into our advertising platform may contain errors or defects, which could harm our reputation and hurt our business.



	 


	We use a combination of custom and third
	party software, including open source software, in building our advertising platforms. Although we test software before incorporating
	it into our platforms, we cannot guarantee that all of the third party technology that we incorporate will not contain errors,
	bugs or other defects. We continue to launch enhancements to our mobile advertising platform, and we cannot guarantee any such
	enhancements will be free from these kinds of defects. If errors or other defects occur in technology that we utilize in our mobile
	advertising platform, it could result in damage to our reputation and losses in revenue, and we could be required to spend significant
	amounts of additional resources to fix any problems.



	 




	The recent global financial crisis,
	uncertainty in global economic conditions and out history of losses may have significant negative effects on our access to credit
	and our ability to raise capital.



	 


	The recent global financial crisis which
	has included, among other things, significant reductions in and heightened credit quality standards for available capital and liquidity
	from banks and other providers of credit, substantial reductions and/or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, and
	concerns that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period, may make it difficult for us to raise additional
	capital or obtain additional credit, when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We may need to enter into additional credit facilities
	in the future to operate the business. Our history of operating losses may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing
	for our operations, investing activities, or financing activities. This difficulty or inability could materially limit our business
	operations and adversely affect our business performance.



	 




	If we do not comply with the financial
	covenants in our credit agreements, our financial condition could be adversely affected.



	 


	Our credit facilities contain provisions
	that could limit our ability to, among other things, incur, create or assume additional debt, sell or otherwise dispose of our
	or any of our subsidiaries’ assets, or consolidate or merge with or into, or acquire the obligations or stock of, or any
	other interest in, another person. In addition, our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified
	levels of tangible net worth and liquid assets. Our ability to meet those financial covenants can be affected by events beyond
	our control, and we may be unable to satisfy these covenants. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we may be required to
	identify restricted cash equal to our outstanding capital lease balance, if any, plus our outstanding standby letter of credit
	(“SBLC”) or, in the event of default, we may be required to pay the lenders cash in an amount equal to the capital
	lease balance, if any is outstanding. Paying such cash balances could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
	condition.

	Risks Related to Operating in our Industry




	 




	Economic downturns and political and
	market conditions beyond our control could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 


	Our business depends on the overall demand
	for advertising and on the economic health of our current and prospective advertisers. Economic downturns or instability in political
	or market conditions may cause current or new advertisers to reduce their advertising budgets. Adverse economic conditions and
	general uncertainty about economic recovery are likely to affect our business prospects. In particular, uncertainty regarding the
	budget crisis in the United States may cause general business conditions in the United States and elsewhere to deteriorate or become
	volatile, which could cause advertisers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our solution, This could expose us to increased
	credit risk on advertiser orders, which, in turn, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
	In addition, concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the EU as well as continued geopolitical turmoil
	in many parts of the world have, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions, which could lead to reduced spending
	on advertising.



	 




	Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in
	the economy, in internet usage and in traditional retail shopping may have an effect on our business.



	 


	Both cyclical and seasonal fluctuations
	in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality may affect our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer
	months, and queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends may cause fluctuations
	in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.



	 




	Seasonal fluctuations in advertising
	activity could adversely affect our cash flows.



	 


	Our cash flows from operations could vary
	from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of our advertisers’ spending. For example, many advertisers devote the
	largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. To
	date, these seasonal effects have been masked by our rapid revenue growth. However, if and to the extent that seasonal fluctuations
	become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period as a result.



	 




	If we fail to prevent, detect and remove
	invalid search queries and clicks, we could lose the confidence of our search advertisers, thereby causing our business to suffer.



	 


	Invalid clicks are an ongoing problem for
	the Internet search advertising industry, and we are exposed to the risk of invalid clicks on customers’ text advertisements
	coming from within our distribution network. Invalid clicks occur when a person or robotic software causes a click on a paid listing
	to occur for some reason other than to view the underlying content. Invalid clicks are commonly referred to as “click fraud.”
	We continue to invest significant time and resources in preventing, detecting and eliminating invalid traffic from our distribution
	network. However, the perpetrators of click fraud have developed sophisticated methods to evade detection, and we are unlikely
	to be able to completely detect and remove all invalid traffic from our search network.


	 


	Currently and in the past we have been
	subject to advertiser complaints and litigation regarding invalid clicks, and we may be subject to search advertising customer
	complaints, claims, litigation or inquiries in the future. We have from time to time credited invoices or refunded revenue to our
	customers due to invalid traffic, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. If our systems to detect invalid traffic are
	insufficient, or if we find new evidence of past invalid clicks, we may have to issue credits or refunds retroactively to our search
	advertisers, and we may still have to pay revenue share to our distribution network partners. This could negatively affect our
	profitability and hurt our brand. If traffic consisting of invalid clicks is not detected and removed from our advertising network,
	the affected search advertising customers may experience a reduced return on their investment in our online advertising because
	the invalid clicks will not lead to conversions for the search advertising customers. This could lead the search advertisers to
	become dissatisfied with our products, which could lead to loss of search advertising customers and revenue and could materially
	and adversely affect our financial results.



	 




	We compete with many companies, some
	of whom are more established and better capitalized than us.



	 


	We compete with a variety of companies
	on a worldwide basis both through the Internet and in traditional markets. Many of these companies are larger and better capitalized
	than us. There are also few barriers to entry in our markets. Our competitors may develop services that are superior to, or have
	greater market acceptance than our services. For example, many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories,
	significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than us. These factors may
	allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.
	Our competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns
	and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger client bases. In addition, current and potential
	competitors are making, and are expected to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative, and, in some cases,
	exclusive relationships with significant companies or competitors to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive products
	and services.

	System failures could significantly
	disrupt our operations and cause us to lose advertiser customers or advertising inventory.



	 


	Our success depends on the continuing and
	uninterrupted performance of our own internal systems, which we utilize to distribute and place ads, monitor the performance of
	advertising campaigns and manage inventory of advertising space. Our revenue depends on the technological ability of our platforms
	to deliver ads and measure them on a per click basis. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide
	services to customers, including technological failures affecting our ability to deliver ads quickly and accurately and to process
	users’ responses to ads, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our services to advertisers and reduce our revenue.
	Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious
	human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may
	be expensive and may not ultimately be successful in preventing system failures.



	 




	Any failure in the performance of our
	key production systems could materially and adversely affect our revenues.



	 


	Any system failure that interrupts our
	hosted products or services, whether caused by computer viruses, software failure, power interruptions, intruders, hackers, or
	other causes, could harm our financial results. For example, our system for tracking and invoicing clicks is dependent upon a proprietary
	software platform. If we lose key personnel or experience a failure of software, this system may fail. In such event, we may be
	unable to track paid clicks and invoice our customers, which would materially and adversely affect our financial results and business
	reputation. Moreover, our services are governed by Service Level Agreements that, if not met, require the payment of credits to
	our customers depending upon the level of service interruption.


	 


	The occurrence of a natural disaster or
	unanticipated problems at our principal headquarters or at a third-party data center could cause interruptions or delays in our
	business. A loss of data could render us unable to provide some services. Our California facilities exist on or near known earthquake
	fault zones and a significant earthquake could cause an interruption in our services. An interruption in our ability to serve advertisements,
	track paid clicks, bill and collect invoices, and provide customer support would materially and adversely affect our financial
	results.



	 




	Our business and operations depend on
	Internet service providers and third party technology providers, and any failure or system downtime experienced by these companies
	could materially and adversely affect our revenues.



	 


	Our distribution network partners and search
	advertising customers depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other third parties for access to our
	services. These service providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages, delays and other
	operating difficulties in the future. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our reputation, brand
	and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.


	 


	We have agreements with third-party click
	tracking and ad-serving technology providers. We do not presently maintain fully redundant click tracking, customer account, and
	web serving systems at separate locations. Accordingly, our operations depend on the ability of our Data Center to protect the
	systems in their data centers from system failures, earthquake, fire, power loss, water damage, telecommunications failure, hacking,
	vandalism, and similar events. We cannot guarantee that our Internet access will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Although
	we maintain property insurance and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not protect against some risks and we cannot
	guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of a catastrophic system
	failure. Also, if our third-party click tracking or ad-serving technology providers experience service interruptions, errors or
	security breaches, our ability to track, realize, and record revenue would suffer.



	 




	We may face liability for claims related
	to our products and services, and these claims may be costly to resolve.



	 


	Internet users, search advertisers, other
	customers, and companies in the Internet, technology and media industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations
	related to defamation, negligence, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair advertising, unfair competition, invasion of privacy,
	patent infringement or other claims. Lawsuits are filed against us from time to time. As we enter foreign markets, our potential
	liability could increase. In addition, we are obligated in some cases to indemnify our customers or distribution network partners
	in the event that they are subject to claims that our services infringe on the rights of others.


	 


	Litigating these claims could consume significant
	amounts of time and money, divert management’s attention and resources, cause delays in integrating acquired technology or
	releasing new products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required,
	may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our insurance may not adequately cover claims of this type, if at all. If
	a court were to determine that some aspect of our services infringed upon or violated the rights of others, we could be prevented
	from offering some or all of our services, which would negatively impact our revenue and business. For any of the foregoing reasons,
	litigation involving our listings business and technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results
	and financial condition.

	Our failure to protect our intellectual
	property rights could diminish the value of our services, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.



	 


	We regard the protection of our intellectual
	property, which includes trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and patent applications, as critical to our
	success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual
	restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality
	agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our intellectual
	property and proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our
	intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar
	technologies by others.


	 


	We seek patent protection for certain of
	our technologies and currently have 3 issued U.S. patents. We are also pursuing the registration of our domain names, trademarks
	and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark,
	domain name and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements
	and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions,
	a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase
	our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and time-consuming.


	 


	We have licensed in the past, and expect
	to license in the future, some of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees
	may take unauthorized actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.


	 


	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual
	property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation
	of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce,
	our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many
	countries, such as China and India, do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of European countries
	and the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely
	affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors
	offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our mobile
	advertising services. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether
	we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial
	personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us.
	In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual
	property rights.



	 




	We could be subject to infringement
	claims that may be costly to defend, result in the payment of settlements or damages or cause us to change the way we conduct our
	business.



	 


	Internet, technology and media companies,
	as well as patent holding companies often possess a significant number of patents. Further, many of these companies and other parties
	are actively developing online advertising, search, indexing, electronic commerce and other Web-related technologies, as well as
	a variety of online business models and methods. We believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies,
	including, but not limited to, seeking patent protection. As a result, we may face claims of infringement of patents and other
	intellectual property rights held by others. Also, as we expand our business, acquire and maintain our customer base, and develop
	new technologies, products and services, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement claims. In the
	event that there is a claim or determination that we infringe third-party proprietary rights such as patents, copyrights, trademark
	rights, trade secret rights or other third party rights such as publicity and privacy rights, we could incur substantial monetary
	liability, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements or be prevented from using the rights, which could
	require us to change our business practices in the future and limit our ability to compete effectively. We may also incur substantial
	expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims. The occurrence of any of
	these results could harm our brand and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers,
	partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims or determinations,
	which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages.

	Litigation, regulation, legislation
	or enforcement actions directed at or materially affecting us may adversely affect the commercial use of our products and services
	and our financial results.



	 


	New lawsuits, laws, regulations and enforcement
	actions applicable to the online industry may limit the delivery, appearance and content of our advertising or our publisher customers’
	advertisers or otherwise adversely affect our business. If such laws are enacted, or if existing laws are interpreted to restrict
	the types and placements of advertisements we or our publishers’ customers can carry, it could have a material and adverse
	effect on our financial results. For example, in 2002, the Federal Trade Commission, in response to a petition from a private organization,
	reviewed the way in which search engines disclose paid placement or paid inclusion practices to Internet consumers and issued guidance
	on what disclosures are necessary to avoid misleading consumers about the possible effects of paid placement or paid inclusion
	listings on the search results. In 2003, the United States Department of Justice issued statements indicating its belief that displaying
	advertisements for online gambling might be construed as aiding and abetting an illegal activity under federal law. In 2004, the
	United States Congress considered new laws regarding the sale of pharmaceutical products over the Internet and the use of adware
	to distribute advertisements on the Internet. In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission proposed new regulations relating to online
	behavioral targeting. Moreover, as we enter into foreign markets, we may become subject to additional regulation and legislation.
	If any new law or government agency were to require changes in the labeling, delivery or content of our advertisements, or if we
	are subject to legal proceedings regarding these issues, it may reduce the desirability of our services or the types of advertisements
	that we can run, and our business could be materially and adversely harmed. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers,
	partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain claims related to online advertising laws, regulations and enforcement
	actions, which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages.


	 


	In addition, legislation or regulations,
	including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”), present ongoing compliance
	risks, and a failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could materially harm our business. As we continue our Section
	404 compliance efforts we may identify significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses, in the design and operation of our internal
	control over financial reporting. We may be unable to remediate any of these matters in a timely fashion, and/or our independent
	registered public accounting firm may not agree with our remediation efforts. Such failures could impact our ability to record,
	process, summarize and report financial information, and could impact market perception of the quality of our financial reporting,
	which could adversely affect our business and our stock price.


	 


	The Company is involved, from time to time,
	in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although the results of litigation and
	claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters to have a material adverse impact
	on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise. However, an unfavorable resolution
	of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations, cash flows or financial position
	in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense costs, diversion
	of management resources and other factors.


	 



	Activities of our advertiser customers
	could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.



	 


	Our advertiser customers’ promotion
	of their products and services may not comply with federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations
	relating to mobile communications. Failure of our customers to comply with federal, state or local laws or our policies could damage
	our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads we deliver
	if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties
	or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. Although we generally receive
	assurance from our advertisers that their ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other
	intellectual property included in an ad, and although we are normally indemnified by the advertisers, a third party or regulatory
	authority may still file a claim against us. Any such claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt our
	reputation. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability as a result of the activities of our advertiser clients, we could be
	required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend
	significant resources.



	  




	Our business practices with respect
	to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry
	standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.



	 


	In the course of providing our services,
	we transmit and store information related to the ads we place. Federal, state and international laws and regulations can govern
	the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect across our advertising platform. We strive to comply
	with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible
	that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may
	conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international
	laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or
	actions against us by governmental entities or others. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our
	industry alleging various violations of privacy-related laws. Any such proceedings could hurt our reputation, force us to spend
	significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect
	the demand for our services and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable
	to indemnify and hold harmless our clients from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of data that
	we store or handle as part of providing our services.

	The regulatory framework for privacy issues
	worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and
	changes in industry practices. For example, in early 2012, the State of California entered into an agreement with several major
	mobile app platforms under which the platforms have agreed to require mobile apps to meet specified standards to ensure consumer
	privacy. Subsequently, in January 2013, the State of California released a series of recommendations for privacy best practices
	for the mobile industry. In January 2014, a California law also became effective amending the required disclosures for online privacy
	policies. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws
	and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect our business.


	 


	As we expand our operations globally, compliance
	with regulations that differ from country to country may also impose substantial burdens on our business. In particular, the European
	Union has traditionally taken a broader view as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations
	under data privacy regulations. In addition, individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation
	and implementation of the regulations, which has resulted in variation of privacy standards from country to country. In January
	2012, the European Commission announced significant proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, including
	changes in obligations of data controllers and processors, the rights of data subjects and data security and breach notification
	requirements. The EU proposals, if implemented, may result in a greater compliance burden if we deliver ads to mobile device users
	in Europe. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our
	business practices in a manner that could compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.



	 




	Privacy-related regulation of the Internet
	could limit the ways we currently collect and use personal information, which could decrease our advertising revenues or increase
	our costs.



	 


	Internet user privacy has become an issue
	both in the United States and abroad. The United States Congress and Federal Trade Commission are considering new legislation and
	regulations to regulate Internet privacy. The Federal Trade Commission and government agencies in some states and countries have
	investigated some Internet companies, and lawsuits have been filed against some Internet companies, regarding their handling or
	use of personal information. Any laws imposed to protect the privacy of Internet consumers may affect the way in which we collect
	and use personal information. We could incur additional expenses if new laws or court judgments, in the United States or abroad,
	regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if any agency chooses to investigate our privacy practices.


	 


	We, along with some of our distribution
	network partners or search advertising customers, retain information about our consumers. If others were able to penetrate the
	network security of these user databases and access or misappropriate this information, we and our distribution network partners
	or search advertising customers could be subject to liability. These claims may result in litigation, our involvement in which,
	regardless of the outcome, could require us to expend significant time and financial resources. In addition, many of our agreements
	with our customers, partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain claims related to privacy laws, regulations
	and enforcement actions which could increase our costs in defending such claims and damages.



	 




	Legislation and regulation of online
	businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for
	compliance failures, or cause us to change our technology platform or business model, which could have a material adverse effect
	on our business.



	 


	Government regulation could increase the
	costs of doing business online. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering legislation related to online advertising
	and we expect to see an increase in legislation and regulation related to advertising online, the use of geo-location data to inform
	advertising, the collection and use of anonymous Internet user data and unique device identifiers, such as IP address or unique
	mobile device identifiers, and other data protection and privacy regulation. Recent revelations about bulk online data collection
	by the National Security Agency, and news articles suggesting that the National Security Agency may gather data from cookies placed
	by Internet advertisers to deliver interest based advertising, may further interest governments in legislation regulating data
	collection by commercial entities, such as advertisers and publishers and technology companies that serve the advertising industry.
	Such legislation could affect the costs of doing business online, and could reduce the demand for our solution or otherwise harm
	our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international
	laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal
	data. While we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, address, phone
	numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial or health data, we may obtain information that are or may be considered
	personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. Evolving and changing definitions
	of personal data, within the EU, the United States and elsewhere, could cause us in the future, to change our business practices,
	or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. Data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are
	evolving and could result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.
	While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use and disclose in the operation of our business,
	and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to such information, such measures may not always be effective. In addition,
	while we take steps to avoid collecting personally identifiable information about consumers, we may inadvertently receive this
	information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of delivering advertising. Our failure to comply with
	applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment
	of our officers and public censure, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and
	loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
	Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, could harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solution by
	current and future advertisers and advertising agencies.

	Advertisers and our partners use “cookies”
	(small text files) to gather important data in the delivery of advertisements. These cookies are placed through an Internet browser
	on an Internet user’s computer and correspond to a data set. These cookies are known as “third party” cookies
	because of a lack of a direct relationship with the Internet user. These cookies collect anonymous information, such as when an
	Internet user views an ad, clicks on an ad, or visits one of our advertiser customer’s websites. On mobile devices, there
	may also be location based information about the user’s device. These cookies are used to help achieve our advertiser customer’s
	campaign goals, to help ensure that the same Internet user does not unintentionally see the same advertisement too frequently,
	to report aggregate information to advertisers regarding the performance of their advertising campaigns and to detect and prevent
	fraudulent activity throughout our network of inventory. Data from cookies are also used to help decide whether to bid on, and
	how much to bid on, an opportunity to place an advertisement in a certain location, at a given time, in front of a particular Internet
	user. A lack of data associated with cookies may detract from the ability to make decisions about which inventory to purchase for
	an advertiser’s campaign, and undermine the effectiveness of our solution.


	 


	Cookies may easily be deleted or blocked
	by Internet users. All of the most commonly used Internet browsers (including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari) allow
	Internet users to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Internet users can also delete cookies from their computers
	at any time. Some Internet users also download “ad blocking” software that prevents cookies from being stored on a
	user’s computer. If more Internet users adopt these settings or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently
	do, our business could be harmed. In addition, the Safari browser blocks cookies by default, and other browsers may do so in the
	future. Unless such default settings in browsers were altered by Internet users, we would be able to set fewer of our cookies in
	browsers, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, companies such as Google have publicly disclosed their intention
	to move away from cookies to another form of persistent unique identifier, or ID, to indicate Internet users in the bidding process
	on advertising exchanges. If companies do not use shared IDs across the entire ecosystem, this could have a negative impact on
	our ability to find the same anonymous user across different web properties, and reduce the effectiveness of our solution.


	 


	In addition, in the European Union, or
	EU, Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the “Cookie Directive,” directs EU member states to ensure that
	accessing information on an Internet user’s computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has
	given his or her consent. We may not be able to develop or implement additional tools that compensate for the lack of data associated
	with cookies. Moreover, even if we are able to do so, such additional tools may be subject to further regulation, time consuming
	to develop or costly to obtain, and less effective than our current use of cookies.


	 



	Potential “Do Not Track”
	standards or government regulation could negatively impact our business by limiting access to the anonymous user data that informs
	the advertising campaigns we facilitate, and as a result could degrade our performance for our customers.



	 


	As the use of cookies has received ongoing
	media attention over the past three years, some government regulators and privacy advocates have suggested creating a “Do
	Not Track” standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their web
	browser, not to have their website browsing recorded. All the major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a “Do
	Not Track” setting. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 10 includes a “Do Not Track” setting that is selected
	“on” by default. However, there is no definition of “tracking,” no consensus regarding what message is
	conveyed by a “Do Not Track” setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a “Do Not Track”
	preference. It is possible that we could face competing policy standards, or standards that put our business model at a competitive
	disadvantage to other companies that collect data from Internet users, standards that reduce the effectiveness of our solution,
	or standards that require us to make costly changes to our solution. The Federal Trade Commission has stated that it will pursue
	a legislative solution if the industry cannot agree upon a standard. The “Do-Not-Track Online Act of 2013” was introduced
	in the United States Senate in February 2013. If a “Do Not Track” web browser setting is adopted by many Internet users,
	and the standard either imposed by state or federal legislation, or agreed upon by standard setting groups, requires us to recognize
	a “Do Not Track” signal and prohibits the use of non-personal data as currently done, then that could hinder growth
	of advertising and content production on the web generally, and limit the quality and amount of data we are able to store and use,
	which would cause us to change our business practices and adversely affect our business.

	Our business involves the use, transmission
	and storage of confidential information, and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational
	harm and monetary damages.



	 


	We may at times collect, store and transmit
	information of, or on behalf of, our clients that may include certain types of confidential information that may be considered
	personal or sensitive, and that are subject to laws that apply to data breaches. We believe that we take reasonable steps to protect
	the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent
	or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our
	efforts to protect this information. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons
	whose information was disclosed or accessed. Most states have enacted data breach notification laws and, in addition to federal
	laws that apply to certain types of information, such as financial information, federal legislation has been proposed that would
	establish broader federal obligations with respect to data breaches. We may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for
	such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed.
	The unauthorized disclosure of information may result in the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships or a reduction
	in client confidence and usage of our services. We may also be subject to litigation alleging the improper use, transmission or
	storage of confidential information, which could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients, require significant
	expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue.



	 




	Online commerce security risks, including
	security breaches, identity theft, service disrupting attacks and viruses, could harm our reputation and the conduct of our business,
	which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.



	 


	A fundamental requirement for online commerce
	and communications is the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we have developed
	and use systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions
	and other security breaches, our security measures may not prevent security breaches or identity theft that could harm our reputation
	and business. Currently, a significant number of our customers provide credit card and other financial information and authorize
	us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication
	technology to provide the security and authentication to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including customer
	credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may
	result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to
	illicitly obtain a user’s password could access the user’s transaction data. An increasing number of websites have
	reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of litigation
	and possible liability. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by
	security breaches.


	 


	Additionally, our servers are vulnerable
	to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, and we have experienced “denial-of-service”
	type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend
	significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Disruptions in our services
	and damage caused by viruses and other attacks could cause a loss of user confidence in our systems and services, which could lead
	to reduced usage of our products and services and materially adversely affect our business and financial results.



	 




	Our data and information systems and
	network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats. If our security measures are breached and an
	unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information, our information systems may be
	perceived as being unsecure, which could harm our business and reputation, and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated
	which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



	 


	In our operations, we store and transmit
	our proprietary information and information related to our customers. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity
	of our facilities and operations. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable
	to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure
	of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security
	measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Since techniques
	used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until
	launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance
	of such an attack on our systems. In addition, if we select a vendor that uses cyber or “cloud” storage of information
	as part of their service or product offerings, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary
	information may be misappropriated by third parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security
	of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer
	damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally,
	misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.

	New tax treatment of companies engaged
	in Internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our search service and our financial results.



	 


	Tax authorities at the international, federal,
	state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce. New or
	revised state tax regulations may subject us or our search advertising customers to additional state sales, income and other taxes.
	We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised
	taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness
	of advertising and selling goods and services over the Internet. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business
	and results of operations.



	 




	Risks Related to the Capital Market




	  




	Our quarterly revenues and operating
	results may fluctuate for many reasons, which may make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results
	to fall below investors’ and analysts; expectations, negatively affecting our stock price.



	 


	Our revenues and operating results have
	fluctuated in the past, and will likely fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, many
	of which are beyond our control. Because our business is changing and evolving rapidly, our historical operating results may not
	be useful in predicting our future operating results. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, without
	limitation:

	the demand for, and prevailing prices of, Internet advertising and marketing services;




	 






	●


	changes to our traffic acquisition costs related to our Advertiser Network, including changes to
	the economic prospects of our advertisers generally, which could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities
	and increase the time or costs required to complete sales with advertisers;

	Due to the above factors, we believe that
	period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful, and you should not rely on past financial
	results as an indicator of our future performance. If our financial results in any future period fall below the expectations of
	securities analysts and investors, the market price of our securities would likely decline.



	 




	Our stock price is extremely volatile,
	and such volatility may hinder investors’ ability to resell their shares for a profit or avoid a loss.



	 


	The stock market has experienced significant
	price and volume fluctuations in recent years, and the stock prices of Internet companies have been extremely volatile. The low
	trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect its liquidity and reduce the number of market makers and/or large investors
	willing to trade in our common stock, making wider fluctuations in the quoted price of our common stock more likely to occur. You
	should evaluate our business in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays and difficulties associated with managing and
	growing a business in a relatively new industry, many of which are beyond our control.


	 


	Our stock price may fluctuate, and you
	may not be able to sell your shares for a profit, as a result of a number of factors, including, without limitation:

	In the past, securities class action litigation
	has often been instituted after periods of volatility in the market price of a Company’s securities. A securities class action
	suit against us could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources, regardless of
	the merits or outcome of the case.



	 




	We may need additional capital in the
	future to support our operations and, if such additional financing is not available to us, on reasonable terms or at all, our liquidity
	and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted.



	 


	Although we believe that our working capital
	will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements for the foreseeable future, unanticipated
	developments in the short term, such as the entry into agreements which require large cash payments or the acquisition of businesses
	with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We may seek to raise additional capital through public or private
	debt or equity financings in order to:


	 






	●


	fund the additional operations and capital expenditures;




	 






	●


	take advantage of favorable business opportunities, including geographic expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses
	or technologies;




	 






	●


	develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure beyond current plans;

	develop new product and service offerings;

	take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets; or




	 






	●


	respond to competitive pressures.




	 


	The capital markets, and in particular
	the public equity market for Internet companies, have historically been volatile. It is difficult to predict when, if at all, it
	will be possible for Internet companies to raise capital through these markets. We cannot assure you that the additional financing
	will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our existing
	stockholders may experience substantial dilution.



	 




	We do not anticipate paying any cash
	dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.



	 


	We have not declared or paid cash dividends
	on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our
	business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. There is no guarantee
	that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares
	will be able to be maintained.



	 




	We will incur costs and demands upon
	management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the United States.



	 


	As a public company listed in the United
	States we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating
	to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and stock exchanges, may increase legal
	and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject
	to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
	regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this
	investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention
	from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations
	and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.


	 


	Failure to comply with these rules might
	also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we
	might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar
	coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve
	on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management



	 




	If our estimates or judgments relating
	to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could
	fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could result in a decline in our stock price.

	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical
	experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances (as described in the section
	entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”), the results
	of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that
	are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results could be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if
	actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions. If, as a result, our operating results fall below the expectations of
	investors and securities analysts, our stock price could decline. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated
	financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, accounting
	for internal use software and income taxes.



	 




	Concentration of ownership of our common
	stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant
	corporate decisions.



	 


	As of December 31, 2015, our executive
	officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate,
	beneficially owned approximately 68% of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly
	influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant
	corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other
	stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring, delaying or preventing a change of control of our
	company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our
	company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.



	 




	We depend on key persons and
	the loss of any key person could adversely affect our operations

	.


	 


	The future success of our business is dependent
	on our management team, including Michael Onghai, our Chief Executive Officer, and our professional team and employees. If one
	or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily
	replace them, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel. The loss of our key personnel
	could severely disrupt our business and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
	Furthermore, since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher
	compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure investors
	that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel needed to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we
	do not have in place “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of key members
	of our professional team or employees could negatively affect our financial performance. 



	 




	Provisions of Delaware corporate law
	and provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt.



	 


	Our charter and bylaws and provisions of
	Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including an attempt that might result in a premium over the market price
	for our common stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights,
	preferences and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.
	The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate
	purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
	In addition, our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors. These provisions, along with Section 203 of the
	Delaware General Corporation Law, prohibiting certain business combinations with an interested stockholder, could discourage potential
	acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control.



	 




	If we fail to maintain proper and effective
	internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.



	 


	We are subject to the reporting requirements
	of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
	Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that
	we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and perform system and
	process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness
	of our internal controls over financial reporting. This requires that we incur substantial professional fees and internal costs
	related to our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts.

	We may in the future discover areas of
	our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting
	will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
	reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations
	in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will
	not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.


	 


	If we are unable to maintain proper and
	effective internal controls in the future, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude
	that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could
	decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.



	 




	If securities or industry analysts do
	not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our
	share price and trading volume could decline.



	 


	The trading market for our common stock
	will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.
	We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change
	their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage
	of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause
	our share

	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS





	  


	On October 3, 2013, 4Media S.R.L., a Societa
	responsabilita (“WeBoost”) filed a complaint against the Predecessor with the Superior Court of California for the
	County of San Francisco. The matter was subsequently removed to the United States District Court, Northern District of California.
	WeBoost’s complaint asserted claims for breach of contract and extra-contractual tort and punitive damages related to “click
	fraud”.  The parties agreed to a $42,500 settlement at an April 21, 2015 mediation. This amount was subsequently paid
	by the Predecessor on April 24, 2015. WeBoost’s complaint and cross claim was dismissed with prejudice on May 4, 2015. 


	 


	The Company is involved, from time to time,
	in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims
	cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect resolution of these matters to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
	results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could, depending on its
	amount and timing, materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a future period. Regardless
	of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other
	factors.

	LookSmart Group, Inc.
	(“LookSmart” or the “Company”) was organized in 2015 and is incorporated in the State of Nevada. LookSmart
	Group was spun-off from its predecessor, LookSmart Limited (“Predecessor”), as a result of a reverse merger and spin-off
	transaction (the “Transaction”) with Pyxis Tankers(“Pyxis”).


	 


	The Predecessor completed
	the Transaction on October 28

	th

	 2015. For year to year comparisons, when we refer to the year 2014, we are referring
	to the Predecessor since the Company was organized in 2015.


	 


	Prior to the execution
	of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company in anticipation
	of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and the liabilities
	of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s shares of the common
	stock shall be cancelled and Company shall be 100% owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record date
	set for said distribution. As a result of the Spin-off, each share of the Predecessor received one share of LookSmart Group common
	stock. Following the merger, LookSmart Group had a total of 5,768,851 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company’s
	stock is traded in the OTCMarkets Pinksheets.


	 


	In addition, in connection
	with the reverse merger with Pyxis, the Predecessor consummated a 1 to .1512 reverse split, thereby reducing the number of its
	shares outstanding from 5,768,851 to 872,036. Each post-split share of the Predecessor was cancelled and exchanged for the right
	to receive 1.0667 shares of Pyxis common stock. Following the reverse merger, Pyxis had a total of 18,244,671 shares (giving effect
	to rounding up on fractional shares) of common stock issued and outstanding. (See

	Merger/Spin-off Reorganization Transaction

	LookSmart is a digital
	advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search and display advertising customers, organized along five
	lines of business: (i) Clickable, (ii) LookSmart AdCenter, (iii) Novatech.io, (iv) ShopWiki and (v) web searches. In addition,
	LookSmart formed a partnership with Conversion Media Holdings, LLC, which supports the Company’s other lines of business
	through the creation of content sites directed at ecommerce verticals. The Company operates its partnership and each line of business,
	while being related to the others in terms of shared resources, as separate business lines with their own core management, profits
	and losses, and the ability to operate independently as separate businesses. As a result, this separation of business lines allows
	Looksmart to operate effectively as a holding company and as a capital allocator to each of the Company’s separate businesses
	with the goal of finding mispriced assets in the public and private markets and subsequently taking those assets to create scalable
	and sustainable businesses that may then be monetized for the ultimate benefit of Looksmart’s stockholders.

	Clickable Inc., is
	a subsidiary of LookSmart and incorporated in Delaware. In September 2013, LookSmart Limited (“Predecessor”), through
	its wholly owned subsidiary LookSmart Canada Ltd., purchased the assets related to its Syncapse Inc. (“Syncapse”) technology
	for $3 million from MNP Ltd., a receiver appointed by Ontario Superior Court of Justice under an appointment order.  As a
	result of this transaction, the Predecessor acquired a social media platform that the Company believes has allowed it to quickly
	scale into social media analytics, publishing, and moderation. This, in turn, should allow our enterprise customers the ability
	to publish, monitor and analyze their social media presence on paid, owned and earned media.  In January 2014, LookSmart re-branded
	Syncapse as “Clickable.”


	 


	Clickable helps brands
	and agencies measure marketing ROI through a customer’s lifetime by connecting critical marketing and advertising products
	and services into one platform that gives customers the ability to analyze, publish, moderate, social media and search marketing.
	Clickable also offers its platform as a white label solution to agencies who use it to save hours of time creating reports,
	increase transparency to clients, increase stickiness of clients, increase recurring revenue streams, and upsell other tools and
	services. The Company has begun to work with large international brands to assist them in creating, maintaining and analyzing their
	social media presence online. The Company’s goal is to partner with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest
	and YouTube, as well as others, to provide vertically integrated solutions that will offer customers the ability to maximize their
	ad spend in all relevant ad categories.


	 


	In addition, Clickable
	allows customers to manage paid, owned and earned media by providing a suite of solutions for social media marketers that include
	publishing, monitoring, data storage, compliance, management, ad placement and analytics.  The “Clickable Analytics”
	dashboard provides customers with the ability to easily put all of their cross channel marketing (search, display, social, email,
	video, offline) and audience data from various sources into one unified, flexible and customizable platform.  The platform
	allows the customer to better understand and utilize the data for the customizing and layering of customer specific key performance
	indicators.  The Company believes that this platform will allow customers to combine data in a way that better suits their
	particular marketing, financial and operational goals both with standard and customized dashboards and analytics.  This platform
	allows companies to gather and manage Application Programming Interface (“API”) data from many data providers that
	LookSmart aims to partner with, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, as well as analyze such data in the “Clickable”
	proprietary platform and within a company’s own data warehouse.


	 



	LookSmart AdCenter



	 


	We have developed a proprietary web-based
	advertising auction platform, the “AdCenter”, that allows us to create, track, analyze, report and optimize customers’
	advertising campaigns. Through the AdCenter platform, our customers are provided with search, social, display, mobile and video
	advertising solutions as well as analytic, moderation and publishing workflow solutions across the entire social media marketing
	ecosystem. The AdCenter indexes ads, analyzes webpage information to match advertising to relevant content, matches search queries
	to advertising and utilizes advanced fraud detection techniques in a high-volume ad serving environment. The platform also collects
	impression and click data for each listing that we manage for our customers and provides us with billing information. In addition,
	we provide each of our advertising customers with a password-protected online account that enables them to track, analyze and optimize
	their search marketing campaigns using online reports. The platform also includes an interface for publishers to access ad syndication
	feed reports and revenue information.


	 


	The advertisers that comprise the Company’s
	customer network include intermediaries, direct advertising customers and their agencies, as well as self-service customers in
	the United States and certain other countries. These AdCenter customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to large Fortune
	50 companies. Self-service advertisers are customers that sign-up directly online with the Company and pay by credit card. Direct
	advertisers (and their agencies) include customers whose main objective is to obtain conversions or sales from clicks. Intermediary
	customers do not directly advertise on our platform but sell into the affiliate networks of the large search engine providers.


	 


	Through a web interface or our proprietary
	API, LookSmart’s AdCenter allows multiple search advertising customers to upload keywords, manage daily budgets, set rates
	and view reports-including spend data that is updated hourly. Search advertising customers can also access keyword suggestions,
	price and traffic estimates, online help and frequently asked questions (“FAQ”). The AdCenter API is also available
	for search advertising customers and related agencies that use third-party or in-house systems to analyze and manage their search
	campaigns.

	LookSmart's search advertising network
	generates advertisements that target search intent queries on Looksmart.com and partner publisher sites.  The network offers
	search advertising customers targeted search capability through a monitored search advertising distribution network.  LookSmart
	also offers advertisers the ability to buy graphical display advertising. LookSmart’s trading desk personnel utilize Demand
	Side Platform (“DSP”) technology and licensed data from third party providers to purchase targeted advertising on a
	real-time bid basis. By leveraging our extensive historical search marketing network data along with performance data from a
	conversion pixel, LookSmart constructs models of the highest performing audiences and targets those audiences via the Company’s
	exchange inventory. LookSmart offers its trading desk as a managed service.


	 


	Further, LookSmart offers publishers licensed
	private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher Solutions”).
	Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers and portals
	to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	LookSmart offers a suite of customizable
	search advertising management tools and solutions that help publishers grow their audience, control advertiser relationships, and
	enhance and optimize the monetization of their sites. Our Publisher Solutions can be branded and configured according to publishers’
	needs. We offer publishers:

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	Our financial condition and results of
	operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies, which include estimates, assumptions, and judgments on the part
	of management. We base our estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and
	prior experience, experience of other enterprises in the same industry, new related events, current economic conditions and information
	from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance, the results of which form the basis for
	making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates,
	judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,
	as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.


	 


	The following discussion highlights those
	policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions, which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information
	in this report.



	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	The Consolidated Financial Statements have
	been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). This requires
	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue, expenses, and
	contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. We base our estimates on various factors and information which may
	include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience, experience of other enterprises in the same industry, new related
	events, and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under
	the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 




	Investments



	 


	We invest our excess cash primarily in
	debt instruments of high-quality corporate and government issuers. All highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of
	purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments. All instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance
	sheet date are considered long-term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating
	cycle. Such securities are classified as short-term investments. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried
	at fair value.


	 


	Changes in value of these investments are
	primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature. Except for declines in fair value
	that are not considered temporary, net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated
	other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. We recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the
	specific identification method.



	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	Our estimates of fair value for assets
	and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority
	to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure
	of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level
	of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
	and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. The three levels of the hierarchy
	are as follows:


	 




	Level 1:


	Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access.




	 




	Level 2:


	Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, default rates, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.




	 






	 



	35



	 







	 




	 




	Level 3:


	Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use.





	 




	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Our online search advertising revenue is
	composed of per-click fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with Intermediaries. The per-click
	fee charged for keyword-targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content, up
	to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer. The Company has profit-sharing agreements with several customers
	that call for the sharing of profits and losses. Profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreement. Revenue from
	these profit-sharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit.


	 


	Revenue also includes revenue share from
	licensing of private-labeled versions of our AdCenter Platform.


	 


	Revenues associated with online advertising
	products, including Advertiser Networks, are generally recognized once collectability is established, delivery of services has
	occurred, all performance obligations have been satisfied, and no refund obligations exist. We pay distribution network partners
	based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners. These payments
	are called TAC and are included in cost of revenue. The revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by
	distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners. This revenue is reported gross
	due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service.


	 


	We also enter into agreements to provide
	private-labeled versions of our products, including licenses to the AdCenter platform technology. These license arrangements may
	include some or all of the following elements: revenue-sharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue
	generated through the AdCenter application; upfront fees; minimum monthly fees; and other license fees. We recognize upfront fees
	over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance, other license fees over the term of the license, and revenue-sharing
	portions over the period in which such revenue is earned. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable,
	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably
	assured.


	 


	We provide a provision against revenue
	for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds. The amounts of these provisions are evaluated
	periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends.


	 


	Deferred revenue is recorded when payments
	are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements. Customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments
	for online advertising.


	 


	The Company evaluates individual arrangements
	with customers to make a determination under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
	(“ASC”) 605-45

	Revenue Recognition

	. We test and record revenue accordingly.



	 




	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts



	 


	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts
	for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments. This valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted
	on a periodic basis. The review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables
	and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in past
	due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer-specific circumstances, such as bankruptcy.



	 




	Concentrations, Credit Risk and Credit Risk Evaluation





	 





	Concentration of Credit Risk



	 


	Financial instruments that potentially
	subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts
	receivable. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial
	institution, City National Bank (“CNB”), and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits
	on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument. The Company also invests
	in fully collateralized funds with maturities of less than two years. These amounts exceed federally insured limits at December
	31, 2015 and 2014. The Company has not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does
	not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation
	based on market prices.

	Credit Risk, Customer and Vendor Evaluation



	 


	Accounts receivable are typically unsecured
	and are derived from sales to customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated
	credit losses. We apply judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on our evaluation of the
	customer’s financial condition and past collection history and record a specific allowance. In addition, we record an allowance
	based on the length of time the receivables are past due. Historically, such losses have been within our expectations.

	that accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable:

	Property and equipment are stated at cost,
	except when an impairment analysis requires use of fair value, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets as follows:

	Leasehold improvements are amortized on
	a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term.


	 


	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed
	of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on
	such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures
	that substantially increase an asset’s useful life are capitalized.


	 


	In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company
	acquired a 10,000 square foot Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. This facility has allowed the Company to consolidate its
	data needs in a company-owned Data Center, and should allow for the expansion of its cloud-based offerings to its customers.



	 




	Internal Use Software Development Costs



	 


	We capitalize external direct costs of
	materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal-use computer software and the payroll and payroll-related
	costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internal-use computer software. These
	costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a three-year period once the project
	is placed in service.


	 


	Management exercises judgment in determining
	when costs related to a project may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and in determining
	the amortization period for the capitalized costs, which is generally three years. The Company expects to continue to invest in
	internally developed software and to capitalize such costs in the future, although no such costs were capitalized in the year ended
	December 31, 2015.



	 




	Restructuring Charges



	 


	In 2015, the Predecessor completed the
	transaction with Pyxis on October 28

	th

	 2015. Restructuring costs associated with the transaction totaled $0.43
	million in the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.


	 


	In 2012, the Company entered into an agreement
	to sublease its office space in San Francisco under terms generally equivalent to its existing commitment. Restructuring costs
	associated with the sub-lease of the San Francisco office, totaling $0.04 in the year ended 2014 are being amortized over the remaining
	term of the underlying lease which ended in 2014.

	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	The Company reviews long-lived assets held
	or used in operations, including property and equipment and internally developed software, for impairment in accordance with ASC
	360-10 “

	Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

	”.


	 


	The Company reviews assets for evidence
	of impairment annually at year-end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
	The impairment review requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows, as well as
	other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions,
	changes in business operations and changes in competition.


	 



	Traffic Acquisition Costs



	 


	The Company enters into agreements of varying durations with
	its distribution network partners that display the Company’s listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the
	revenue-per-click that the Company receives when the ads are clicked on those partners’ sites.


	 


	The Company also enters into agreements of varying durations
	with third party affiliates. These affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage of the Company’s
	revenue or based on a certain metric, such as number of searches or paid clicks.


	 


	TAC expense is recorded in cost of revenue.


	 



	Advertising Costs



	 


	Advertising costs are charged to sales
	and marketing expenses as incurred and were insignificant and $0.05 million


	in the year ended December
	31, 2015, respectively. Advertising costs were insignificant in both the year ended December 31, 2014.


	 



	Product Development Costs



	 


	Research of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products
	are charged to expense as incurred.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes using
	the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between
	the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
	are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected
	to be realized. The Company records liabilities, where appropriate, for all uncertain income tax positions. The Company recognizes
	potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense.


	 



	Comprehensive Loss



	 


	Other comprehensive loss as of December
	31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale
	and foreign currency translation adjustments.


	 



	Net Loss per Common Share



	 


	Basic net loss per share is calculated
	using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, excluding treasury stock. Diluted net loss per share is calculated
	using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding, excluding treasury stock, during
	the period, using the treasury stock method for stock options. As a result of the Company’s net loss position at both December
	31, 2015 and 2014, there is no dilution.


	 



	Segment Information



	 


	The Company has one operating segment,
	online advertising. While the Company operates under one operating segment, management reviews revenue under five lines of business:
	(i) Clickable, (ii) LookSmart AdCenter, (iii) Novatech.io, (iv) ShopWiki and (v) web searches.

	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31,
	2014, the Company’s accounts receivable and deferred revenue are primarily related to the online advertising segment. All
	long-lived assets are located in the United States and Canada.


	 



	Adoption of New Accounting Standards



	 


	On January 2, 2014 we adopted guidance
	issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), ASU 2013-04, “

	Liabilities – Obligations
	Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation is Fixed at the Reporting
	Date

	”, an amendment providing guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from
	joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. Adoption
	of this new guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.


	 






	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements






	 





	The FASB
	has issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-01 about Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating
	the Concept of Extraordinary Items. The objective is to reduce the cost and complexity of income statement presentation by eliminating
	the concept of extraordinary items while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial
	statements. The extraordinary items must met two criteria’s: unusual nature and infrequency of occurrence. If an event or
	transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from
	the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing
	operations. The entity also is required todisclose applicable income taxes. This amendment will be effective for annual periods,
	and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The board decided to permit early adoption
	provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued ASU No. 2015-03 about Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The objective is to require that debt issuance
	costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
	that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected
	by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
	issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal year. For all other entities,
	the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015,
	and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption of the amendments in the Update
	is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued ASU No. 2015-05 about Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software. The objective is to provide a guidance about
	whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license,
	then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software
	licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement
	as a service contract. The amendment will not change GAAP for a customer’s accounting for service contracts. In addition,
	the guidance in this Update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16. Consequently, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic
	350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. For public business entities, the Board decided
	that the amendments will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
	December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the amendment will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
	and interim periods in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all entities.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued ASU No. 2015-06 about Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, which contains guidance that addresses master limited partnerships
	that originated from Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-4. This amendment in this Update specify that for purposes
	of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before
	the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported
	earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements)
	would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses)
	differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method
	also are required. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim
	periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued ASU No. 2015-07 about Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient,
	to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. The amendments in this
	Update remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using
	the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all
	investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those
	disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient.
	The amendments in this Update apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment within the related
	scope by using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued No. 2015-10 “Technical Corrections and Improvements”, which aims to address feedback received from stakeholders
	on the Codification and make improvements to GAAP. The amendments in this update represent changes to clarify the Codification,
	correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
	effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Some of the amendments will
	make the Codification easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving
	the presentation of guidance in the Codification. The amendments in this update will apply to all reporting entities within the
	scope of the affected accounting guidance. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim
	periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued No. 2015-11“Topic 330, Inventory”, which aims to simplify the measurement of inventory by changing the subsequent
	measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory within the scope
	of this Update. The amendments in this update do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the
	retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in,
	first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net
	realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public
	business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.

	The FASB
	has issued No. 2015-14“Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which aims to respond to stakeholders’
	requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in Update 2014-09 and to consider feedback received through extensive outreach
	with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements. The amendments in this update defer the effective date of Update
	2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans
	should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
	reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued No. 2015-15“Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest”: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement
	of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement
	at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting. This amendment adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement on June 18, 2015, Emerging
	Issues Task Force meeting about the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit
	arrangements.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued No. 2015-16“Topic 805, Business Combinations”: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,
	which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving
	the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update require that an acquirer
	recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which
	the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period’s
	financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result
	of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments
	in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion
	of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the
	adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments
	in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal
	years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
	and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.




	 




	The FASB
	has issued No. 2015-17“Topic 740, Income Taxes”: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which aims to identify,
	evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while
	maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this update
	require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The
	amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement
	that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not
	affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this update will align the presentation of deferred income tax assets
	and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
	are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
	those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
	Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.




	 



	Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies
	that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements upon adoption.

	Asset Impairment Charge



	 


	The Company reviews assets for evidence
	of impairment annually at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
	The impairment review requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows, as well as
	other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions,
	changes in business operations and changes in competition. At December 31, 2014, the Company determined that continuing losses
	associated with the use of long-lived assets and a projection of associated future cash flows required the adjustment of long-lived
	assets to fair market value at December 31, 2014. The lower projected operating results reflect changes in assumptions related
	to revenue growth rates, market trends, business mix, cost structure, and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and
	long-term operating results. Accordingly, long-lived assets including capitalized software, computer equipment, furniture and fixtures,
	software and leasehold improvements with a recorded net book value of $2.7 million were reduced to fair market value of $0.4 million
	at December 31, 2014.


	 


	The fair value of the long-lived assets
	was derived based on Level 3 inputs, which are based on significant inputs that are not observable.  The fair value of the
	capitalized software long-lived assets was determined using an income approach, based on expected future cash flows and market
	considerations.  The fair value of the computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, software and leasehold improvements long-lived
	assets was determined using a market approach, based on comparable fair values of similar assets.



	 




	Restructuring Charges



	 .


	In 2015, the Predecessor completed the
	transaction with Pyxis on October 28

	th

	 2015. Restructuring costs associated with the transaction totaled $0.43
	million in the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.


	 


	In 2012, the Company entered into an agreement
	to sublease its office space in San Francisco under terms generally equivalent to its existing commitment. Restructuring costs
	associated with the sub-lease of the San Francisco office, totaling $0.04 in the year ended 2014 are being amortized over the remaining
	term of the underlying lease which ended in 2014.

	At December 31, 2015,
	we had $0.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable investments. Cash equivalents, short- and long-term
	marketable investments are comprised primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government, commercial paper, time
	deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. corporate securities and collateralized debt obligations. We actively monitor the depository
	institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and the institutions of whose debt instruments we hold. Our investment policy,
	which is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors, primarily emphasizes safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield
	on those funds. We can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse
	conditions in the financial markets.  These balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
	While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could
	be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.
	Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements below, further describes the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and short-
	and long-term investments.


	 


	Cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term
	investments decreased $0.2 million in 2015 primarily due to operating losses.


	 


	Our primary source
	of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flow from operations. We believe that our existing
	cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current anticipated cash
	requirements through at least the next 12 months, if not longer. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand
	for our services beyond the current quarter, and changes in customer buying behavior. Also, if the banking system or the financial
	markets continue to remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could
	be adversely affected. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings
	in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures, take advantage of favorable business opportunities, develop and upgrade
	our technology infrastructure, develop new product and service offerings, take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets
	or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments, including
	the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We cannot be assured that additional
	financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities,
	our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution.

	Operating Activities



	 


	Cash used in operating activities in the
	year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization,
	provision for doubtful accounts, share-based compensation expense, and deferred lease incentive, as well as the effect of changes
	in working capital and other activities. Cash used in operations in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.8 million and consisted
	of a net loss of $3.2 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $1 million, and cash used in working capital and other activities
	of $0.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property
	and equipment. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of $0.6 million decrease in accounts receivable
	offset by $0.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in accounts receivable is primarily attributed
	to change in mix of revenue while the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily attributed to a reduction
	in expenditures.


	 


	Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December
	31, 2014, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, provision for doubtful
	accounts, share-based compensation expense, and deferred lease incentive, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and
	other activities. Cash used in operations in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $4.1 million and consisted of a net loss of $6.4
	million, adjustments for non-cash items of $1.5 million, and cash used in working capital and other activities of $0.8 million.
	Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment,
	$0.08 million in deferred lease incentive, $0.03 million of restructuring charge expense and $0.06 million of bad debt expense.
	In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of $0.3 million decrease in accounts receivable offset by
	$0.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in accounts receivable is primarily attributed
	to reduced revenue while the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily attributed to decrease in cash flow.



	 




	Investing Activities



	 


	Cash used in investing activities during
	the year ended December 31, 2015 of $0.3 million was primarily attributed to the purchase of intangible assets.


	 


	Cash provided by investing activities during the year ended
	December 31, 2014 of $2.1 million was primarily attributed to $3.1 million net sale of investments. Capital expenditures for the
	year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $1.0 million for property, software and equipment acquired during 2014.



	 




	Financing Activities



	 


	Cash provided by financing activities in
	the year ended December 31, 2015 of $3 million is primarily attributed to increases in log-term liabilities and notes payable,
	as well as proceeds from additional paid-in capital.


	 


	Cash used in financing activities in the year ended December
	31, 2014 of $0.3 million is primarily attributed to $0.17 million in scheduled capital lease payments and $0.17 million in repurchases
	of treasury stock.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
	as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4), investments in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. Additionally,
	we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.



	 




	Operating Leases



	 


	The Company entered into a 30-month operating lease agreement
	for various network operating equipment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014.



	 




	Purchase Obligations



	 


	The Company had no outstanding purchase
	obligations as of December 31, 2015. The Company had outstanding purchase obligations of an insignificant amount relating to an
	open purchase order for which the Company had not received the related services or goods.

	Indemnification



	 


	We have agreements whereby we indemnify
	our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving, at our request, in
	such capacity, to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. The maximum potential amount of future
	payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. However, we maintain directors and officers
	insurance coverage that may contribute, up to certain limits, a portion of any future amounts paid for indemnification of directors
	and officers. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage
	is minimal. Historically, we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types
	of indemnities.


	 


	Additionally, in the normal course of business,
	we have made certain guarantees, indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain
	transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to our customers and distribution network partners
	in connection with the sales of our products, and indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain
	claims arising from such facility or lease. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these guarantees,
	indemnities and commitment due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved
	in each particular provision.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of


	LookSmart Group, Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated
	balance sheets of LookSmart Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements
	of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial
	statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
	financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with


	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting.


	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on
	a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial

	Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies






	 




	Nature of Business



	 


	LookSmart Group, Inc. (“LookSmart”
	or the “Company”) is a digital advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search and display
	advertising customers. LookSmart was organized in 1996 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware.


	 


	LookSmart operates in a large online advertising
	ecosystem serving ads that target user queries on partner sites.


	 


	LookSmart offers search advertising customers
	targeted search via a monitored search advertising distribution network using the Company’s “AdCenter” platform
	technology. The Company’s search advertising network includes publishers and search advertising customers, including intermediaries
	and direct advertising customers and their agencies as well as self-service customers in the United States and certain other countries.


	 


	LookSmart also offers advertisers the ability
	to buy graphical display advertising. LookSmart’s trading desk personnel utilize DSP technology and licensed data from third
	party providers to buy targeted advertising on a real-time bidded basis. By leveraging our extensive historical search marketing
	network data along with performance data from a conversion pixel, LookSmart constructs models of the highest performing audiences,
	and targets them via exchange inventory. LookSmart offers its trading desk as a managed service.


	 


	In addition, Looksmart, under its “Clickable”
	and “Syncapse” brands, allows customers to manage paid, owned and earned media by providing a suite of solutions for
	social media marketers that include publishing, monitoring, data storage, compliance, management, ad placement and analytics.


	 


	Further, LookSmart offers publishers licensed
	private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher Solutions”).
	Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers and portals
	to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2013 the
	Company began to make available a LookSmart-branded search engine.  For parties submitting search queries, the Company offers
	free-of-charge search results ranked and presented based on proprietary algorithms.   While early in its evolution,
	part of the Company's current search engine monetization strategy is to generate sponsored search results as a part
	of overall search results and provide links to paying advertisers’ websites.


	 


	Our largest category of customers is Intermediaries,
	the majority of which sell into the affiliate networks of the large search engine providers. Another category of customers is
	Direct Advertisers and their agencies whose objective is to obtain conversions or sales from the clicks, while others want unique
	page views. The last category of customers is Self-Service advertisers that sign-up online and pay by credit card.


	 


	In 2013, the Company made the decision to
	decrease the amount of revenue that it received from Intermediaries compared to 2012. Current Management believes that this decision
	is in the best interests of the Company on a go-forward basis. Decreasing Intermediary revenue represented a continued trend from
	2012 and was the primary driver of the Company's overall 2013 revenue decreases. The Company believes its revenue trends are tied
	to market-wide changes in the search ecosystem that have had a severe impact on Intermediary business models and consequently
	the business Intermediaries conduct with us. In both 2013 and 2012, we ceased business with a number of Intermediaries. Intermediaries
	continue as our largest category of customer.


	 


	In September 2013, LookSmart purchased the
	Syncapse Technology Assets for $3 million from MNP Ltd., a Receiver appointed by Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Appointment
	Order. Upon the completion of this transaction, the Company acquired a social media platform that allows enterprise customers
	the ability to publish, monitor and analyze their social media presence on paid, owned and earned media. The Company has begun
	to work with large international brands to assist them in creating, maintaining and analyzing their social media presence online.
	As a result of the Syncapse asset purchase, the Company is expanding its offerings to our current customer base. Our expanded
	offering allows LookSmart’s traditional customers the ability to manage ad spend in both search and social platforms. The
	Company intends to partner with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube, as well as others, to
	offer customers the ability to maximize their ad spend in all relevant ad categories.

	In November of 2013, LookSmart acquired an
	approximate 10,000 square foot Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona.  This facility will allow the Company to consolidate
	its data needs in a company-owned Data Center, as well as expand its cloud based offerings to our customers.  Looksmart is
	in the process of consolidating its cloud services in its newly occupied wholly owned secure Data Center.


	 


	In addition, LookSmart offers publishers licensed
	private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher Solutions”).
	Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers and portals
	to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.



	 




	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The Consolidated Financial Statements include
	the accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated
	in consolidation.



	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	The Consolidated Financial Statements have
	been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). This requires
	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue, expenses, and
	contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information
	which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience, experience of other enterprises in the same industry,
	new related events, and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable
	under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 




	Investments



	 


	The Company invests its excess cash primarily
	in debt instruments of high-quality corporate and government issuers. All highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date
	of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments. All instruments with maturities greater than one year from the
	balance sheet date are considered long-term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current
	operating cycle. Such securities are classified as short-term investments. These securities are classified as available-for-sale
	and carried at fair value.


	 


	Changes in the value of these investments
	are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature. Except for declines in fair value
	that are not considered temporary, net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported in the Consolidated Statements
	of Comprehensive Loss. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification
	method.



	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s estimate of fair value
	for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the
	highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available.
	The disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining
	the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active
	markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. The three levels of the
	hierarchy are as follows:


	 






	Level 1:


	Unadjusted
	quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have
	the ability to access.




	 






	Level 2:


	Quoted
	prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical
	or similar assets in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant
	inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, default rates, etc.) or can
	be corroborated by observable market data.




	 






	Level 3:


	Valuations
	based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs
	reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use.

	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Our online search advertising revenue is composed
	of per-click fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with Intermediaries. The per-click fee charged
	for keyword-targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content, up to a maximum
	cost per keyword or page content set by the customer. The Company has profit-sharing agreements with several customers that call
	for the sharing of profits and losses. Profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreements. Revenue from these
	profit-sharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit.


	 


	Revenue also includes revenue share from licensing
	of private-labeled versions of our AdCenter Platform.


	 


	Revenues associated with online advertising
	products, including Advertiser Networks, are generally recognized once collectability is established, delivery of services has
	occurred, all performance obligations have been satisfied, and no refund obligations exist. We pay distribution network partners
	based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners. These
	payments are called TAC and are included in cost of revenue. The revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic
	supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners. This revenue
	is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising
	service.


	 


	We also enter into agreements to provide private-labeled
	versions of our products, including licenses to the AdCenter platform technology. These license arrangements may include some
	or all of the following elements: revenue-sharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue generated through
	the AdCenter application; upfront fees; minimum monthly fees; and other license fees. We recognize upfront fees over the term
	of the arrangement or the expected period of performance, other license fees over the term of the license, and revenue-sharing
	portions over the period in which such revenue is earned. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or
	determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable
	is reasonably assured.


	 


	We provide a provision against revenue for
	estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds. The amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically
	based upon customer experience and historical trends. The allowance included in trade receivables, net is insignificant at both
	December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.


	 


	Deferred revenue is recorded when payments
	are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements. Customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments
	for online advertising.


	 


	The Company evaluates individual arrangements
	with customers to make a determination under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
	(“ASC”) 605-45

	Revenue Recognition

	. We test and record revenue accordingly.



	 




	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts



	 


	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
	accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments. This valuation allowance is reviewed
	on a periodic basis. The review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables
	and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in
	past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company anticipated or for customer-specific circumstances,
	such as bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in trade accounts receivable, net is $ .84 million for each of
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense is insignificant and
	$0 and $ .12 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.



	 




	Concentrations, Credit Risk and Credit Risk Evaluation




	 




	Concentration of Credit Risk



	 


	Financial instruments that potentially subject
	the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable.
	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial institution,
	City National Bank (“CNB”), and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum
	portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument. The Company also invests in fully
	collateralized funds with maturities of less than two years. These amounts exceed federally insured limits at December 31, 2015
	and 2014. The Company has not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe
	it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based
	on market prices.

	Credit Risk, Customer and Vendor Evaluation



	 


	Accounts receivable are typically unsecured
	and are derived from sales to customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances
	for estimated credit losses. The Company applies judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily
	on management’s evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and records a specific
	allowance. In addition, the Company records an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due. Historically,
	such losses have been within management’s expectations.

	Property and Equipment



	 


	Property and equipment are stated at cost,
	except when an impairment analysis requires use of fair value, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets as follows:


	 




	Computer equipment


	 


	3 to 4 years




	Furniture and fixtures


	 


	5 to 7 years




	Software


	 


	2 to 3 years




	Building Improvements


	 


	10 years




	Building


	 


	39 years





	 


	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
	straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term.


	 


	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed
	of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on
	such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures
	that substantially increase an asset’s useful life are capitalized.


	 


	In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company
	acquired a 10,000 square foot Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. This facility will allow the Company to consolidate its
	data needs in a company-owned Data Center, as well as expand its cloud-based offerings to our customers.



	 




	Internal Use Software Development Costs



	 


	The Company capitalizes external direct costs
	of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal-use computer software and the payroll and payroll-related
	costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internal-use computer software. These
	costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a three year period once the project
	is placed in service.


	 


	Management exercises judgment in determining
	when costs related to a project may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and in determining
	the amortization period for the capitalized costs, which is generally three years. The Company expects to continue to invest in
	internally developed software, although no such costs were capitalized in 2013.



	 




	Restructuring Charges



	 


	In 2015, the Predecessor completed the transaction
	with Pyxis on October 28

	th

	 2015. Restructuring costs associated with the transaction totaled $0.43 million in
	the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.


	 






	 



	58



	 







	 




	 


	In 2012, the Company entered into an agreement
	to sublease its office space in San Francisco under terms generally equivalent to its existing commitment. Restructuring costs
	associated with the sub-lease of the San Francisco office, totaling $0.04 in the year ended 2014 are being amortized over the
	remaining term of the underlying lease which ended in 2014.


	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	The Company reviews long-lived assets held
	or used in operations, including property and equipment and internally developed software, for impairment in accordance with ASC
	360-10 “

	Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

	”


	 


	The Company reviews assets for evidence of
	impairment annually at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
	The impairment review requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows, as well
	as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions,
	changes in business operations and changes in competition.


	 


	The fair value of the long-lived assets was
	derived based on Level 3 inputs, which are based on significant inputs that are not observable.  The fair value of the capitalized
	software long-lived assets was determined using an income approach, based on expected future cash flows and market considerations. 
	The fair value of the computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, software and leasehold improvements long-lived assets was determined
	using a market approach, based on comparable fair values of similar assets.



	 




	Traffic Acquisition Costs



	 


	The Company enters into agreements of varying
	durations with its distribution network partners that display the Company’s listings ads on their sites in return for a
	percentage of the revenue-per-click that the Company receives when the ads are clicked on those partners’ sites.


	 


	The Company also enters into agreements of
	varying durations with third party affiliates. These affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage
	of the Company’s revenue or based on a certain metric, such as number of searches or paid clicks.


	 


	TAC expense is recorded in cost of revenue.



	 




	Share-Based Compensation



	 


	The Company recognizes share-based compensation
	costs for all share-based payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock awards,
	and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, over the requisite service period based on their relative
	fair values. We estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
	Our assumptions about stock-price volatility are based on the actual volatility of our publicly traded stock. The risk-free interest
	rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the
	grant. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity. The value of the portion of the award that is
	ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite
	service periods. Share-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $0.04 million
	and $0.2 million, respectively, which was related to stock grants, options and employee stock purchases.


	 


	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant
	in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is determined at the end
	of each fiscal quarter, based on historical rates.


	 


	The Company elected to adopt the alternative
	transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional
	paid-in capital pool (“APIC pool”) related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, and to determine
	the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee share-based compensation
	awards.



	 




	Advertising Costs



	 


	Advertising costs are charged to sales and
	marketing expenses as incurred and were insignificant in both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.



	 




	Product Development Costs



	 


	Research of new product ideas and enhancements
	to existing products are charged to expense as incurred.

	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes using
	the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between
	the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
	are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected
	to be realized. The Company records liabilities, where appropriate, for all uncertain income tax positions. The Company recognizes
	potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense.



	 




	Comprehensive Loss



	 


	Other comprehensive loss as of December 31,
	2015 and 2014 consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale and foreign currency
	translation adjustments.



	 




	Net Loss per Common Share



	 


	Basic net loss per share is calculated using
	the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, excluding treasury stock. Diluted net loss per share is calculated using
	the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding, excluding treasury stock, during the
	period, using the treasury stock method for stock options. As a result of the Company’s net loss position at December 31,
	2015 and 2014, there is no dilution.



	 




	Segment Information



	 


	The Company has one operating segment, online
	advertising. While the Company operates under one operating segment, management reviews revenue under two product offerings—Advertiser
	Networks and Publisher Solutions.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of the
	Company’s accounts receivable, intangible assets, and deferred revenue are related to the online advertising segment. All
	long-lived assets are located in the United States and Canada.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 





	The FASB has
	issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-01 about Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating
	the Concept of Extraordinary Items. The objective is to reduce the cost and complexity of income statement presentation by eliminating
	the concept of extraordinary items while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial
	statements. The extraordinary items must met two criteria’s: unusual nature and infrequency of occurrence. If an event or
	transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from
	the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing
	operations. The entity also is required todisclose applicable income taxes. This amendment will be effective for annual periods,
	and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The board decided to permit early adoption
	provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued ASU No. 2015-03 about Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The objective is to require that debt issuance
	costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
	that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected
	by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
	issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal year. For all other entities,
	the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015,
	and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption of the amendments in the Update
	is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued ASU No. 2015-05 about Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software. The objective is to provide a guidance about
	whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license,
	then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software
	licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement
	as a service contract. The amendment will not change GAAP for a customer’s accounting for service contracts. In addition,
	the guidance in this Update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16. Consequently, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic
	350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. For public business entities, the Board decided
	that the amendments will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
	December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the amendment will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
	and interim periods in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all entities.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued ASU No. 2015-06 about Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, which contains guidance that addresses master limited partnerships
	that originated from Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-4. This amendment in this Update specify that for purposes
	of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before
	the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported
	earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements)
	would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses)
	differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method
	also are required. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim
	periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued ASU No. 2015-07 about Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to
	measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. The amendments in this Update
	remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the
	net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments
	that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures
	are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments
	in this Update apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment within the related scope by using
	the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued No. 2015-10 “Technical Corrections and Improvements”, which aims to address feedback received from stakeholders
	on the Codification and make improvements to GAAP. The amendments in this update represent changes to clarify the Codification,
	correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
	effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Some of the amendments will
	make the Codification easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving
	the presentation of guidance in the Codification. The amendments in this update will apply to all reporting entities within the
	scope of the affected accounting guidance. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim
	periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.

	The FASB has
	issued No. 2015-11“Topic 330, Inventory”, which aims to simplify the measurement of inventory by changing the subsequent
	measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory within the scope
	of this Update. The amendments in this update do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the
	retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in,
	first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net
	realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public
	business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued No. 2015-14“Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which aims to respond to stakeholders’
	requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in Update 2014-09 and to consider feedback received through extensive outreach
	with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements. The amendments in this update defer the effective date of Update
	2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans
	should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
	reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued No. 2015-15“Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest”: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of
	Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at
	June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting. This amendment adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement on June 18, 2015, Emerging
	Issues Task Force meeting about the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit
	arrangements.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued No. 2015-16“Topic 805, Business Combinations”: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,
	which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving
	the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update require that an acquirer
	recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which
	the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period’s
	financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result
	of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments
	in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion
	of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the
	adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments
	in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal
	years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
	and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.




	 




	The FASB has
	issued No. 2015-17“Topic 740, Income Taxes”: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which aims to identify,
	evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while
	maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this update
	require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The
	amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement
	that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not
	affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this update will align the presentation of deferred income tax assets
	and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
	are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
	those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
	Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.

	The contractual maturities of cash equivalents

	The Company typically invests in highly-rated
	securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. When evaluating the investments for
	other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews such factors as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been
	below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely
	than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis. During the
	years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on outstanding investments. As of
	December 31, 2015, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

	From December 2014 to March 2015, Snowy August
	Management LLC advanced certain funds to the Company in the aggregate amount of $0.6 million. The Company incorrectly stated the
	amount of the funds advanced as $0.75 million in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, but does
	not consider such misstatement material. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Michael Onghai is the manager of Snowy August
	Management LLC. The Company intends to repay in full such funds to Snowy August Management LLC.


	 


	From April 2015 to June 2015, Snowy August
	Management LLC advanced certain funds to the Company in the aggregate amount of $0.1 million.


	 


	On June 5, 2015, LookSmart Ltd. obtained a 12 month loan from Inca
	Capital in the amount of $0.6 million collateralized by our data center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The interest-only loan carries
	an interest rate of 10.5%. The loan’s maturity date is May 30, 2016.


	 


	From July 2015 to September 2015, Snowy August Management LLC advanced
	certain funds to the Company in the aggregate of $0.25 million


	 


	From September 2015 to December 2015, Snowy August Management LLC
	advanced certain funds to the Company in the aggregate of $0.95 million

	Income
	Taxes





	 


	In accordance with ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	(“ASC 740”), the Company accounts for uncertainty in tax positions and recognizes in its financial statements
	the largest amount of a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of
	the position.


	 


	The Company files income tax
	returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Canada and various state jurisdictions. The Company remains subject to U.S. federal
	tax examinations for years 2012-present and Canadian examinations for 2012 to present. The tax years that remain subject to examination
	in state jurisdictions include 2012-present. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be
	sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s
	financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been
	recorded at December 31, 2015.


	 


	The Company’s policy is to recognize
	interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company did not have
	any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, nor were any interest expenses or penalties recognized
	during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.


	 


	The Company was in a net taxable loss position
	in 2015 and 2014. The income tax provision for all years includes minimum state tax and revisions of prior years’ estimated
	taxes.

	According to U.S. Code
	Chapter 26, Section 382, the Company may carryover the NOL from Looksmart Corp. to Looksmart Group, Inc. if the successor company
	is continuing the business enterprise of the predecessor company for two years. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had Net Operating
	Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $75.4 million for federal purposes. The Company also has Alternative Minimum
	Tax (“AMT”) credit carryforwards of $110 thousand for federal purposes. The NOL carryforwards will expire at various
	dates beginning in 2015 through 2032 if not utilized. The AMT tax credit carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. Both
	federal and state NOL carryforwards will be significantly limited. The Company is currently assessing the amount of the limitation.
	A valuation allowance fully offsets the deferred tax asset associated with these NOL carryforwards.


	 


	A valuation allowance existed as of December
	31, 2015 and 2014, due to the uncertainty of net operating loss utilization based on the Company’s history of losses. The
	valuation allowance increased by $1.5 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

	effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is reconciled below:

	Guarantees and Indemnities



	 


	During its normal course of business, the
	Company has made certain guarantees, indemnities and commitments under which it may be required to make payments in relation to
	certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to the Company’s customers and
	distribution network partners in connection with the sales of its products, and indemnities to various lessors in connection with
	facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease.



	 




	Officer and Director Indemnification



	 


	Further, the Company has agreements whereby
	it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving,
	at the Company’s request, in such capacity, to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Nevada. The maximum
	potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
	However, the Company maintains directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute, up to certain limits, a portion
	of any future amounts paid, for indemnification of directors and officers. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these
	indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. Historically, the Company has not incurred any
	losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities.



	 




	Legal Proceedings



	 


	The Company is involved, from time to time,
	in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims
	cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters to have a material adverse impact
	on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise. However, an unfavorable resolution
	of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations, cash flows or financial position
	in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense costs,
	diversion of management resources and other factors.

	Investments



	 


	For investments that have quoted market prices
	in active markets, the Company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed
	in Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service
	(“pricing service”). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes a pricing service to determine
	a single estimate of fair value, which is mainly for its fixed maturity investments. The fair value estimates provided from this
	pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The Company bases all of its estimates of fair
	value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm’s
	length transaction.


	 


	The Company validates the prices received
	from the pricing service using various methods including, applicability of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other national
	government insurance or guarantees, comparison of proceeds received on individual investments subsequent to reporting date, prices
	received from publicly available sources, and review of transaction volume data to confirm the presence of active markets. The
	Company does not adjust the prices received from the pricing service unless such prices are determined to be inconsistent. At
	December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not adjust prices received from the pricing service.

	Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches these contributions in cash up to 5% of annual salary up to a total match of $3
	thousand per year per employee. Employees vest 100% immediately in their own contributions and 50% per year in Company matching
	contributions. Any employer contributions that are not vested are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company, but are reinstated
	if the employee returns to service within five years.

	Going

	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
	going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
	As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a loss from operations of $3.2 million and accumulated deficit
	of $263 million. As of year ended December 31, 2015, the working capital was $1.2 million; the cash used in operating activities
	was $3 million. The Company intends to fund operations through debt and equity financing arrangements. 

	The
	ability of the Company to survive is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations,
	and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to cut expenses, raise revenues, raise
	additional funds through public or private placement offerings, and related party loans. These factors, among others, raise substantial
	doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 


	The Company’s management, with the participation
	of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer has evaluated the effectiveness
	of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
	Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive
	Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information that it is required to disclose
	in reports that the Company files with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
	by the Exchange Act rules and regulations.




	 






	Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting




	 


	The Company’s management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
	and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, provide reasonable assurance regarding
	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:


	 







	●



	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
	the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;




	 







	●



	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
	and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and




	 







	●



	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
	use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on
	the financial statements.




	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all material misstatements arising from time to time. Therefore,
	even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
	and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
	inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Our management assessed the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
	set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

	Internal Control-Integrated
	Framework

	. Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
	were effective as of December 31, 2015.


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation
	report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting
	because this is not required of the Company pursuant to Regulation S-K Item 308(b).




	 






	Changes in internal control over financial reporting




	 


	There have been no changes in the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(e)
	promulgated under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, that have materially affected, or
	are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

	Audit Fees represent fees

	statements. All Other Fees consist of fees for the audit of our 401(k) plan. Our audit committee considered whether the provision

	it was.



	 




	Policy on Pre-Approval by Audit Committee of
	Services Performed by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms



	 


	The policy of the audit committee
	is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent public accounting firm during
	the fiscal year. The audit committee pre-approves services by authorizing specific projects within the categories outlined above.
	The audit committee's charter delegates to its Chair the authority to address any requests for pre-approval of services between
	audit committee meetings, and the Chair must report any pre-approval decisions to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.
	All of the services related to the fees described above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the pre-approval provisions
	set forth in the applicable SEC rules and the audit committee's charter.

	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 




	Nature of Business



	 


	LookSmart Group, Inc.
	(“LookSmart” or the “Company”) is a digital advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions
	for search and display advertising customers. LookSmart operates in a large online advertising ecosystem serving ads that target
	user queries on partner sites.


	 


	LookSmart offers search
	advertising customers targeted search via a monitored search advertising distribution network using the Company’s “AdCenter”
	platform technology. The Company’s search advertising network includes publishers and search advertising customers, including
	intermediaries and direct advertising customers and their agencies as well as self-service customers in the United States and certain
	other countries.


	 


	LookSmart also offers
	advertisers the ability to buy graphical display advertising. LookSmart’s trading desk personnel utilize DSP technology and
	licensed data from third party providers to buy targeted advertising on a real-time bidded basis. By leveraging our extensive historical
	search marketing network data along with performance data from a conversion pixel, LookSmart constructs models of the highest performing
	audiences, and targets them via exchange inventory. LookSmart offers its trading desk as a managed service.


	 


	In addition, Looksmart,
	under its “Clickable” and “Syncapse” brands, allows customers to manage paid, owned and earned media by
	providing a suite of solutions for social media marketers that include publishing, monitoring, data storage, compliance, management,
	ad placement and analytics.


	 


	Further, LookSmart offers
	publishers licensed private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher
	Solutions”). Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers
	and portals to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	Lastly, in the fourth
	quarter of 2013 the Company began to make available a LookSmart-branded search engine.  For parties submitting search queries,
	the Company offers free-of-charge search results ranked and presented based on proprietary algorithms.   While
	early in its evolution, part of the Company's current search engine monetization strategy is to generate sponsored search
	results as a part of overall search results and provide links to paying advertisers’ websites.


	 


	In September 2013, LookSmart
	purchased the Syncapse Technology Assets for $3 million from MNP Ltd., a Receiver appointed by Ontario Superior Court of Justice
	under the Appointment Order. Upon the completion of this transaction, the Company acquired a social media platform that allows
	enterprise customers the ability to publish, monitor and analyze their social media presence on paid, owned and earned media. The
	Company has begun to work with large international brands to assist them in creating, maintaining and analyzing their social media
	presence online. As a result of the Syncapse asset purchase, the Company is expanding its offerings to our current customer base.
	Our expanded offering allows LookSmart’s traditional customers the ability to manage ad spend in both search and social platforms.
	The Company intends to partner with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube, as well as others,
	to offer customers the ability to maximize their ad spend in all relevant ad categories.


	 


	In November
	of 2013, LookSmart acquired an approximately 10,000 square foot Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The Company had acquired
	the facility intending to use the Data Center to support its technology platforms. At present the Company does not need the Data
	Center for its core businesses and is evaluating other uses for the property. The Company may sell the property if that can occur
	on terms acceptable to management.

	In addition, LookSmart
	offers publishers licensed private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher
	Solutions”). Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers
	and portals to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	On June 3, 2015, LookSmart
	Group, Inc. (“LookSmart” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada. LookSmart Group, Inc.
	was set-up to effect the spun-off from its predecessor, LookSmart Limited (“Predecessor”), as a result of a reverse
	merger and spin-off transaction (the “Transaction”) with Pyxis Tankers(“Pyxis”).


	 


	The Predecessor completed
	the Transaction on October 28, 2015. For year to year comparisons, when we refer to the year 2015, we are referring to the Predecessor.


	 


	Prior to the execution
	of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company in anticipation
	of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and the liabilities
	of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s shares of the common
	stock were cancelled and the Company is 100% owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record date set
	for said distribution. As a result of the Spin-off, each share of the Predecessor received one share of LookSmart Group common
	stock. Following the merger, LookSmart Group had a total of 5,768,851 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company’s
	stock is traded in the OTCMarkets Pinksheets.


	 


	On April 5,
	2016 the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Talkwheel.com, Inc. (“Talkwheel”) into the Company’s
	subsidiary Clickable, Inc. (“Clickable”). Talkwheel had established a community analytics platform of web activity
	to unify and analyze a brand’s social media through a visually interactive community platform. During the three months ended
	September 30, 2016, the Company determined that Talkwheel had breached materially representations and warranties in the Asset Purchase
	Agreement dated February 11, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”) governing the purchase of Talkwheel’s assets. As
	a result Clickable terminated the Purchase Agreement and rescinded the transaction.


	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The Unaudited Consolidated
	Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015, include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
	eliminated in consolidation.



	 




	Unaudited Interim Financial Information



	 


	The accompanying Unaudited
	Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, reflect
	all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair representation
	of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the periods shown. These Unaudited
	Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
	Notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Consolidated
	Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include
	all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)
	for complete financial statements. The results of operations for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 is not necessarily
	indicative of results to be expected for the full year.



	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	The Unaudited Consolidated
	Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
	This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue,
	expenses, and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on various factors
	and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience, experience of other enterprises in the
	same industry, new related events, and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed
	to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
	assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In management’s
	opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement are reflected in the interim periods presented.

	Investments



	 


	The Company invests its
	excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high-quality corporate and government issuers. All highly liquid instruments with
	maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments. All instruments with maturities greater
	than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long-term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities
	in the current operating cycle. Such securities are classified as short-term investments. These securities are classified as available-for-sale
	and carried at fair value.


	 


	Changes in the value of
	these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature. Except for declines
	in fair value that are not considered temporary, net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported in the Unaudited
	Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using
	the specific identification method.



	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s estimate
	of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and
	gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when
	available. The disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable.
	In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted
	prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. The three
	levels of the hierarchy are as follows:


	 






	Level 1:




	Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
	that we have the ability to access.




	 




	Level 2:




	Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
	identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,
	interest rates, yield curves, default rates, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.




	 




	Level 3:




	Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable
	inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use.




	 

	 




	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Our online search advertising
	revenue is composed of per-click fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with Intermediaries. The
	per-click fee charged for keyword-targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content,
	up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer. The Company has profit-sharing agreements with several customers
	that call for the sharing of profits and losses. Profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreements. Revenue from
	these profit-sharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit.


	 


	Revenue also includes revenue share from licensing
	of private-labeled versions of our AdCenter Platform.


	 


	Revenues associated with
	online advertising products, including Advertiser Networks, are generally recognized once collectability is established, delivery
	of services has occurred, all performance obligations have been satisfied, and no refund obligations exist. We pay distribution
	network partners based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network
	partners. These payments are called Traffic Acquisition Costs (“TAC”) and are included in cost of revenue. The revenue
	derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment
	to the distribution network partners. This revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligors to the advertisers
	who are the customers of the advertising service.


	 


	We also enter into agreements
	to provide private-labeled versions of our products, including licenses to the AdCenter platform technology. These license arrangements
	may include some or all of the following elements: revenue-sharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue
	generated through the AdCenter application; upfront fees; minimum monthly fees; and other license fees. We recognize upfront fees
	over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance, other license fees over the term of the license, and revenue-sharing
	portions over the period in which such revenue is earned. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable,
	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably
	assured.

	We provide a provision
	against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds. The amounts of these provisions
	are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends. The revenue allowance included in trade receivables,
	net is insignificant at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 


	Deferred revenue is recorded
	when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements. Customer deposits are recorded when customers make
	prepayments for online advertising.


	 


	The Company evaluates
	individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605-45

	Revenue Recognition

	. We test and record revenue accordingly.



	 




	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts



	 


	The Company maintains
	an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments. This valuation
	allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis. The review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates
	to current receivables and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there
	is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company anticipated or for customer-specific
	circumstances, such as bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in trade accounts receivable, net is $0.8 million
	at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense was insignificant
	for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



	 




	Concentrations, Credit Risk and Credit Risk Evaluation




	 




	Concentration of Credit Risk



	 


	Financial instruments
	that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts
	receivable. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through
	one financial institution, City National Bank (“CNB”), and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage
	limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument. The Company has
	not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant
	credit risk on these funds. The fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices.



	 




	Credit Risk, Customer and Vendor Evaluation



	 


	Accounts receivable are
	typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
	maintains allowances for estimated credit losses. The Company applies judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables
	based primarily on management’s evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and records
	a specific allowance. In addition, the Company records an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due. Historically,
	such losses have been within management’s expectations.

	accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable:

	Leasehold improvements
	are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term.


	 


	When assets are retired
	or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts, and
	any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
	incurred. Expenditures that substantially increase an asset’s useful life are capitalized.


	 


	In the fourth quarter
	of 2013, the Company acquired a 10,000 square foot data center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. This facility has allowed the Company
	to consolidate its data needs in a company-owned data center, and should allow for the expansion of its cloud-based offerings to
	its customers.



	 




	Internal-Use Software Development Costs



	 


	The Company capitalizes
	external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal-use computer software and the payroll
	and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internal-use computer
	software. These costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a three-year period
	once the project is placed in service.


	 


	Management exercises judgment
	in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and
	in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs, which is generally three years. The Company expects to continue
	to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs in the future, although no such costs were capitalized
	in the three months ended September 30, 2016.



	 




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	The Company reviews long-lived
	assets held or used in operations, including property and equipment and internally developed software, for impairment in accordance
	with ASC 360-10 “

	Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

	”.


	 


	The Company reviews assets
	for evidence of impairment annually at year-end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may
	not be recoverable. The impairment review requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash
	flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry
	or market conditions, changes in business operations and changes in competition.

	Traffic Acquisition Costs



	 


	The Company enters into
	agreements of varying durations with its distribution network partners that display the Company’s listings ads on their sites
	in return for a percentage of the revenue-per-click that the Company receives when the ads are clicked on those partners’
	sites.


	 


	The Company also enters
	into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates. These affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based
	on a percentage of the Company’s revenue or based on a certain metric, such as number of searches or paid clicks.


	 


	TAC expense is recorded in cost of revenue.



	 




	Share-Based Compensation



	 


	The Company recognizes
	share-based compensation costs for all share-based payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options,
	restricted stock awards, and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, over the requisite service period
	based on their relative fair values. We estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
	option valuation model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility are based on the actual volatility of our publicly traded
	stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve
	in effect at the time of the grant. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity. The value of the
	portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements
	of Operations over the requisite service periods. In the first quarter of 2015, all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered,
	therefore there was no share-based compensation expense in the three or Nine Months ended September 30, 2016. Share-based compensation
	expense, related to stock option grants and employee stock purchases, recognized were zero for the three months ended September
	30, 2016, and were not significant for the three months ended September 30, 2015.


	 


	Forfeitures are estimated
	at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is determined
	at the end of each fiscal quarter, based on historical rates.


	 


	The Company elected to
	adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation to establish the beginning
	balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC pool”) related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation,
	and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee
	share-based compensation awards.



	 




	Advertising Costs



	 


	Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as
	incurred and were insignificant and $0.01 in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016. Advertising costs were insignificant
	and $0.01 in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2015, respectively

	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for
	income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on
	the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
	year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
	assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The Company records liabilities, where appropriate, for all uncertain income tax
	positions. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations
	as income tax expense.



	 




	Comprehensive Loss



	 


	Other comprehensive loss
	as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
	available-for-sale and foreign currency translation adjustments.

	Net Loss per Common Share



	 


	Basic net loss per share
	is calculated using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, excluding treasury stock. Diluted net loss per share
	is calculated using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding, excluding treasury
	stock, during the period, using the treasury stock method for stock options. As a result of the Company’s net loss position
	at both September 30, 2016 and 2015, there is no dilution.



	 




	Segment Information



	 


	The Company has one operating
	segment, online advertising. While the Company operates under one operating segment, management reviews revenue under two product
	offerings—Advertiser Networks and Publisher Solutions.


	 


	As of September 30, 2016
	and December 31, 2015, the Company’s accounts receivable and deferred revenue are primarily related to the online advertising
	segment. All long-lived assets are located in the United States and Canada.



	 




	Adoption of New Accounting Standards



	 


	On January 2, 2014 we
	adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), ASU 2013-04, “

	Liabilities –
	Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation is Fixed at the
	Reporting Date

	”, an amendment providing guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting
	from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. Adoption
	of this new guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.


	 


	On January 2, 2015, we
	adopted the guidance issued by the FASB, ASU 2015-08, “

	Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property,
	Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360):

	 

	Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an
	Entity.

	" ASU 2015-08 raised the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures
	of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Adoption
	of this new guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In May 2014, the FASB
	issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-09 (“ASU 2015-09”) "

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	."
	ASU 2015-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities
	to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
	which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-09 is effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted.
	We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-09 on our consolidated financial statements.


	 



	2. Merger/Spin-off
	Reorganization Transaction



	 



	The Transaction



	 


	On
	April 23, 2015, LookSmart, Ltd. (the “Predecessor”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
	Agreement”) by and among the Company; LookSmart Group, (the “Company”) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Predecesssor
	; Pyxis Tankers Inc. (“Pyxis”); and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxis (“Merger Sub”). If the transactions
	contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which are subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company at a special meeting (the
	“Meeting”) of the Company, are completed:



	 








	·



	The Company will further amend its Amended Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock
	split (the “Reverse Split”) of its issued and outstanding common stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-two and
	not more than one-for-ten, with the exact ratio to be determined by the Predecessor’s board of directors in its sole discretion;




	 







	·



	All of the business, assets and liabilities of the Predecessor will have been transferred to Company,
	and holders of record of the Predecessor’s common stock will receive a pro rata distribution of one share of Company’s
	common stock for each share of the Predecessor’s common stock held as of the record date set for said distribution (the “Spin-Off”);




	 







	·



	The Predecessor will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger and being
	a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxis (the “Merger”); and




	 





	14

	 





	 




	  







	·



	Each share of the Predecessor’s common stock held by holders of record at the close of business
	on the date of the closing of the Merger will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive the number of share(s) of Pyxis
	common stock equal to $4,000,000 divided by a denominator equal to (i) the final closing price of a share of the Predecessor’s
	common stock (post-Reverse Split) on the date of the closing of the Merger, multiplied by (ii) the number of issued and outstanding
	shares of the Predecessor’s common stock (post-Reverse Split) as of the date that the Merger becomes effective.




	   


	In addition, the Predecessor
	and Pyxis have each agreed to take such actions as are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and have made certain
	other customary covenants in the Merger Agreement. Among other things, the Predecessor has agreed to the preparation and filing
	by Pyxis of a registration statement on Form F-4 in connection with the registration of the Pyxis’ common stock to be issued
	as result of the Merger, which registration statement will contain a joint proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the stockholders
	of the Predecessor.


	 


	The joint proxy statement/prospectus
	for the shareholder vote on the Merger has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and
	the Staff of the SEC has returned comments thereon to the Predecessor and Pyxis, which are preparing responses to these comments.
	A special meeting of the Predecessor’s shareholders to vote on the Merger transactions was held on October 26

	th

	,
	2015.


	 


	As
	a result of the Merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Pyxis is expected to become a public company.
	Pyxis intends to apply to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE MKT under the symbol “PXS.”


	 


	For additional information
	regarding Pyxis and the Merger transaction, see the Predecessor’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 23, 2015.


	 




	Pyxis
	Tankers Inc.






	 




	Pyxis Tankers Inc. is
	a newly formed international maritime transportation company with a focus on the tanker sector. At the consummation of the Merger
	with the Predecessor, Pyxis’ fleet will be comprised of six double hull product tankers with an average current age of four
	years and that are employed under a mix of short- and medium-term time charters and spot charters. Pyxis will acquire these six
	vessels prior to the Merger from an affiliate of its founder and chief executive officer, Mr. Valentis (“Eddie”) Valentis.
	Four of the vessels in the fleet will be medium-range, or MR, product tankers, three of which have eco-efficient or eco-modified
	designs and two will be short-range tanker sister ships. Each of the vessels in the fleet is capable of transporting refined petroleum
	products, such as naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil, as well as other liquid bulk items, such as vegetable
	oils and organic chemicals.


	 



	Spin-Off




	 



	Prior
	to the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company
	in anticipation of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and
	the liabilities of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries, and has agreed to indemnify Pyxis for losses relating to all of
	the liabilities of the Predecessor and its former subsidiaries.


	 


	Upon
	completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s shares of the common stock shall be cancelled and Company shall be 100%
	owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record date set for said distribution.


	 



	The Make Whole
	Record Date



	 


	In
	the event that subsequent to the Merger, Pyxis completes a financing which results in gross proceeds to Pyxis of at least $5,000,000
	(a “

	Future Pyxis Offering

	”) at a valuation lower than the valuation ascribed to the shares of common stock received
	by the Predecessor’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “

	Consideration Value

	”), Pyxis
	will be obligated to make “whole” the Predecessor’s stockholders as of April 29, 2015 (the “

	Make Whole
	Record Date

	”) by offering the Predecessor’s stockholders the right to receive additional shares of Pyxis common
	stock to compensate the Predecessor’s stockholders for the difference in value of their Pyxis common stock.


	 


	In
	addition, should Pyxis fail to complete a Future Pyxis Offering within a date which is 3 years from the date of the closing of
	the Merger, each holder of the Predecessor’s common stock who has held such stock continuously from the date of the Make
	Whole Record Date until the expiration of such 3 year period (the “

	Legacy LS Stockholders

	”) will have a 24-hour
	option beginning at the end of the 3 year period to require Pyxis to purchase from such Legacy LS Stockholders a pro rata amount
	of Pyxis common stock that would result in aggregate gross proceeds to the Legacy LS Stockholders in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000;
	provided that in no event shall a Legacy LS Stockholder receive an amount per share greater than the Consideration Value.

	Voting Agreement



	 


	In
	connection with their entry into the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor, Pyxis and Michael Onghai, entered into a voting agreement,
	which is referred to herein as the “

	Voting Agreement

	.” The Voting Agreement generally requires that Mr. Onghai,
	in his capacity as a stockholder of the Predecessor, vote all of his shares of the Predecessor’s common stock in favor of
	the reverse split proposal, the spin-off proposal and the merger proposal, unless doing so would violate his fiduciary duties as
	an executive officer and member of the board of directors of the Company. Mr. Onghai beneficially holds 3,123,047 shares of the
	Predecessor’s common stock, representing approximately 54.1% of the outstanding shares of the Predecssor’s common stock
	over which he possesses voting rights and are therefore subject to the Voting Agreement.



	 




	Closing



	 


	The Predecessor completed
	the Transaction with Pyxis on October 28

	th

	 2015.


	 


	Prior
	to the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company
	in anticipation of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and
	the liabilities of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s
	shares of the common stock shall be cancelled and Company shall be 100% owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record
	as of the record date set for said distribution. As a result of the Spin-off, each share of the Predecessor received one share
	of LookSmart Group common stock. Following the merger, LookSmart Group had a total of 5,768,851 shares of common stock issued and
	outstanding. The Company is in the process of applying to be traded in the OTC Markets or the Pinksheets.


	 


	In
	addition, in connection with the reverse merger with Pyxis, the Predecessor consummated a 1 to .1512 reverse split, thereby reducing
	the number of its shares outstanding from 5,768,851 to 872,036. Each post-split share of the Predecessor was cancelled and exchanged
	for the right to receive 1.0667 shares of Pyxis common stock. Following the reverse merger, Pyxis had a total of 18,244,671 shares
	(giving effect to rounding up on fractional shares) of common stock issued and outstanding.

	The contractual maturities

	no long-term investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 


	The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its
	policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary
	impairment, the Company reviews such factors as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
	financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required
	to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis. During the three months ended September
	30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on outstanding investments. As of September 30, 2016, the
	Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

	The company had an outstanding
	standby letter of credit issued by City National Bank (CNB) of approximately $0.1 million at December 30, 2014, related to security
	of the subleased corporate office lease and secured by a money market account held at CNB. In February 2015, the Company cancelled
	this letter of credit upon release by the Lessor.



	 




	Guarantees and Indemnities



	 


	During its normal course
	of business, the Company has made certain guarantees, indemnities and commitments under which it may be required to make payments
	in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to the Company’s
	customers and distribution network partners in connection with the sales of its products, and indemnities to various lessors in
	connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease.



	 




	Officer and Director Indemnification



	 


	The Company has agreements
	whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving,
	at the Company’s request, in such capacity, to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
	maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
	However, the Company maintains directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute, up to certain limits, a portion of
	any future amounts paid, for indemnification of directors and officers. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these
	indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. Historically, the Company has not incurred any
	losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities.



	 




	Legal Proceedings




	 



	The Company is otherwise
	involved, from time to time, in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although
	the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters
	to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise.
	However, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations,
	cash flows or financial position in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company
	because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

	Stock Option Plans



	 


	In December 1997, the
	Company approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan (the “1998 Plan”). In June 2007, the stockholders approved the LookSmart
	2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Under the 2007 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified
	stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock rights to employees, directors and consultants. Share-based incentive awards
	are provided under the terms of these two plans (collectively, the “Plans”).


	 


	The Compensation Committee
	of the Board of Directors administers the Company’s Plans. Awards under the Plans principally include at-the-money options
	and fully vested restricted stock. Outstanding stock options generally become exercisable over a four-year period from the grant
	date and have a term of seven years. Grants can only be made under the 2007 Plan. The 1998 Plan is closed to further share issuance
	and all options have expired or been forfeited as of March 31, 2015. The number of shares issued or reserved for issuance under
	the 2007 Plan was 1.2 million and 1.4 million shares of common stock as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

	The aggregate intrinsic

	stock on the last trading day of the period and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would
	have been received by the option holder had all option holders exercised their options at quarter-end. The intrinsic value amount
	changes with changes in the fair market value of the Company’s stock.


	 


	In the first quarter of
	2015, all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered. There are no stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2016.



	 




	Stock Awards



	 


	The Company did not issue restricted stock
	during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Employee Stock Purchase Plan



	 


	On July 14, 2009,
	the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) was approved by the shareholders and authorized to issue up to 500 thousand
	shares of Common Stock to employees. Substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll
	deductions at 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or end of the offering period. Each offering and
	purchase period is Nine Months. ESPP contributions are limited to a maximum of 15% of an employee’s eligible compensation,
	and ESPP participants are limited to purchasing a maximum of 5,000 shares per purchase period. On February 15, 2013, the ESPP was
	suspended pending a review by the Company’s Board of Directors of all equity incentive arrangements. Share-based compensation
	expense for the ESPP was zero in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and insignificant in the three months ended March 31,
	2015. As of September 30, 2016, 28 thousand shares (adjusted for the 3:1 reverse split in November 2013) have been issued
	under the 2009 Plan. In the first quarter of 2015, all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered,



	 




	Share-Based Compensation Valuation Assumptions



	 


	We estimate the fair value
	of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility
	are based on the actual volatility of our publically traded stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual
	life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. We estimate the expected term based
	upon the historical exercise activity.


	 


	No options were granted
	in the first Nine Months of 2016 or 2015, therefore no weighted average assumptions are included here.


	 


	Share-based compensation
	expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced
	for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from those estimates.



	 




	Exercise of Employee and Director Stock Options and Purchase
	Plans



	 


	There were no options
	exercised in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise
	of stock options. No income tax benefits have been realized from exercised stock options.



	 




	Repurchase of Equity Securities by the Company



	 


	There were no shares repurchased
	during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Approximately 98,000 shares were purchased at an average price of $1.78 per share
	under the program in the year ended December 31, 2014, and recorded as Treasury Stock at cost totaling approximately $0.17 million.

	Additional Paid-in Capital




	 



	Paid-in Capital increased
	by $0.6 million. This increase is due to the $0.6 million the Predecessor received from privately-held Pyxis Tankers Inc. (“Pyxis”)
	associated with the announcement in April 2015 that LookSmart, Ltd. (the “Predecessor”) and privately-held Pyxis Tankers
	Inc. ("Pyxis") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby Pyxis will become
	a publicly listed company as a result of the merger between LookSmart, Ltd. ("Predecessor") and into Pyxis' wholly-owned
	subsidiary, Maritime Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation. On the effective date of the merger, in addition, LookSmart will
	spin off its existing business into a new entity called LookSmart Group, Inc. (“LookSmart” or "Company").

	Investments



	 


	For investments that have
	quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the
	amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized
	pricing service (“pricing service”). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes a pricing service
	to determine a single estimate of fair value, which is mainly for its fixed maturity investments. The fair value estimates provided
	from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The Company bases all of its estimates
	of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an
	arm’s length transaction.


	 


	The Company validates
	the prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, applicability of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
	or other national government insurance or guarantees, comparison of proceeds received on individual investments subsequent to reporting
	date, prices received from publicly available sources, and review of transaction volume data to confirm the presence of active
	markets. The Company does not adjust the prices received from the pricing service unless such prices are determined to be inconsistent.
	At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not adjust prices received from the pricing service.



	 




	Trade accounts receivable,
	net:

	The carrying value reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value and is net of allowances for doubtful
	accounts and returns which estimate customer non-performance risk.



	 




	Trade accounts payable
	and accrued liabilities:

	The carrying value reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these items approximates their
	fair value, which is the likely amount that the liability with short settlement periods would be transferred to a market participant
	with a similar credit standing as the Company.

	The following discussion
	should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to those statements, which appear
	elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
	of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We
	use words such as “believes,” “intends,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,”
	“may,” “will” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Discussions containing forward-looking
	statements may be found in the material set forth under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations” and in other sections of this report. All forward-looking statements, including, but not limited
	to, projections, expectations or estimates concerning our business, including demand for our products and services, mix of revenue
	sources, ability to control and/or reduce operating expenses, anticipated gross margins and operating results, cost savings, product
	development efforts, general outlook of our business and industry, future profits or losses, competitive position, share-based
	compensation, adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements, are inherently uncertain as they
	are based on our expectations and assumptions concerning future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous
	known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual
	results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including but not limited
	to, the possibility that we may fail to maintain or grow our listings advertiser base and/or distribution network, that existing
	and potential distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable
	products or pricing terms, that we may be unable to grow our online search advertising revenue and/or find alternative sources
	of revenue, that we may be unable to attain or maintain customer acceptance of our publisher solutions products, that changes in
	the distribution network composition may lead to decreases in query volumes, that we may be unable to maintain or improve our query
	volume, match rate, number of paid clicks, average revenue per click, conversion rate or other ad network metrics, that we may
	be unable to achieve or maintain profitability, that we may be unable to retain our existing credit facilities or obtain new credit
	facilities, that we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses,
	that we may be unable to remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or that one or more of the other risks described elsewhere in
	this report may occur.



	 


	All forward-looking statements
	in this report are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and except as required
	by applicable law; we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	The discussion and analysis
	of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
	requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
	related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates.
	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
	the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical
	accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September
	30, 2016, there had been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.

	The decrease in Advertiser
	Networks revenue for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 is the result of
	a reduction in revenues from all categories: Intermediaries, Direct Advertisers and Self Service Advertisers. We experienced a
	continuing decrease in Advertising Network revenue in the Nine Months of 2016 following a trend that began in late 2011.

	2016, revenue from Intermediaries decreased compared to the Nine Months of 2015.

	At September 30, 2016,
	we had approximately $0.27 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments. Cash equivalents and short-term
	marketable investments are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government, commercial paper, time deposits,
	money market mutual funds, U.S. corporate securities, collateralized debt obligations and other commodities. We actively monitor
	the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and the institutions of whose debt instruments we hold. Our
	investment policy, which is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors, primarily emphasizes safety of principal while secondarily
	on maximizing yield on those funds. We can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not
	be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. These balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
	insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these
	cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in
	the financial markets. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, “Cash and Available for Sale Securities,”
	which describes further the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.


	 


	Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term
	investments increased $0.03 million to $0.27 million at September 30, 2016, from $0.24 million at December 31, 2015, primarily
	due to financing activities, offset by operating losses. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we generated a minimal positive
	cash flow from operations.


	 


	Our primary source of
	liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our current primary use of cash is to fund operating losses
	and investment in software development. . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our services
	beyond the current quarter, and changes in customer buying behavior. Also, if the banking system or the financial markets continue
	to remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely
	affected. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to
	fund our operations and capital expenditures, take advantage of favorable business opportunities, develop and upgrade our technology
	infrastructure, develop new product and service offerings, take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond
	to competitive pressures. In addition, unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments, including the acquisition
	of businesses with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We cannot be assured that additional financing will
	be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders
	may experience substantial dilution.

	Cash used in operating activities in the Nine
	Months ended September 30, 2016, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization,
	provision for doubtful accounts, and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and
	other activities. Cash used in operations in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.386 million and consisted of a net
	loss of $1.071 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.631 million and cash generated by working capital and other activities
	of $0.08 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.682 million of depreciation and amortization expense
	on property and equipment, $0.008 amortization of deferred rent, and $0.043 million in other non-cash charges. In addition, changes
	in working capital activities primarily consisted of a $0.326 million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
	a decrease of $0.249 million in accounts receivable and a $0.009 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The decrease in
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to decreased TAC and operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable
	is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.

	due to the increase in operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.


	 



	Investing Activities



	 


	Cash provided by investing
	activities in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 was zero.


	 


	Cash used in investing activities in the nine
	months ended September 30, 2015 of $0.3 million was attributed to $0.4 million purchase of intangible assets partially offset by
	$0.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments.


	 



	Financing Activities



	 


	Cash provided by financing
	activities in the Nine Months of 2016 of $0.43 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities from Snowy
	August Management, LLC. (See Other Obligations)


	 


	Cash provided by financing activities in the
	first nine months of 2015 of $2.1 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities and notes payable, as well
	as proceeds from additional paid-in capital.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance
	sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4), investments in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings
	or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.



	 




	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments



	 


	In comparison with our
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that there have been no material changes in contractual
	obligations or commercial commitments outside the ordinary course of business, during the three months ended September 30, 2016.




	 








	ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
	RISK



	 


	Pursuant to Section 229.305(e)
	of Regulation S-K, as a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide information regarding quantitative and qualitative
	disclosures about market risk.

	ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Our management, with the
	participation of our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure
	controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”),
	as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on From 10-Q.


	 


	In designing and evaluating
	our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
	operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
	controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
	judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.


	 


	Based on this evaluation,
	our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure
	controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
	information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules and
	forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and principal
	financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes
	in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	ITEM 1.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	The Company is otherwise
	involved, from time to time, in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although
	the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters
	to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise.
	However, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations,
	cash flows or financial position in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company
	because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
