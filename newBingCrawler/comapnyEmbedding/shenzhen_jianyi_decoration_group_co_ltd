P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Dividend Quality Score (Peer Median)
58






                          The Dividend Quality score is calculated based on the quality of the company's current dividend, the trend in dividend quality over the last five years, and the existing dividend coverage. Each of these components is company-specific and not relative to peers. Dividend Quality is not scored for companies that did not pay out a cash dividend in the last twelve months

Company numbers are TTM (trailing twelve months) or latest available. Share price data is previous day's close unless otherwise stated.OverviewShenzhen Jianyi Decoration Group Co., Ltd. Class A currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (5.93) than its peer median (1.57).002789-CN's earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P/E or Price/EBITDA are not meaningful to make this analysis between operating advantage (ROE) and growth expectations (as suggested by P/E or P/EBITDA).002789-CN's median net profit margins and relatively high asset efficiency give it some operating leverage.Changes in annual earnings are in line with its chosen peers but lags in terms of revenue, implying the company is cost conscious and selective about spending for growth.002789-CN's return on assets currently and over the past five years is around the peer median and suggest that it does not have any particular operational advantages versus peers.The company's relatively low gross and pre-tax margins suggest a non-differentiated product portfolio and not much control on operating costs relative to peers.002789-CN's earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P/E or Price/EBITDA are not meaningful for an analysis between historical growth (using annualized three-year revenue growth) and investor growth expectations (as suggested by P/E or Price/EBITDA) .The company is likely overinvesting in a business with only median returns.002789-CN has some amount of debt capacity available.
