China Ting Group Holdings Ltd.


A public company listed on the Main Hong Kong Stock Exchange â€“since 2005 (HKSE code 3398)





 Founded in 1992, China Ting Group Holdings Limited is a vertically-integrated garment manufacturer, exporter and retailer with global offices and design facilities in Paris, New York, Shanghai and Hong Kong.











 
A winning combination of factories equipped with latest technology, expert management, financial stability, and strong business acumen has gained the Group a reputation as a partner of choice.
 








 
Initially considered one of the largest silk groups in China in terms of export volume and value (China Silk Association), China Ting Group has, since, reinforced its position by diversifying into other categories of products and qualities in line with market demand.
 







Headquartered in Hong Kong and supported by a strong manufacturing base in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shenzhen (PRC), China Ting Group is principally engaged in three core sectors:

 Total garment manufacturing : vertically integrated design and production facilities under one roof

Retailing in China: a diverse portfolio of fashion brands for men and women, fully-owned or in collaboration with joint venture partners

Home textile product manufacturing: a jacquard specialist from design to fabrics to finished products
