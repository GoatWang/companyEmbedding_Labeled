 TOP CONTRIBUTORSMichael MitchellBulgaria, the world's 74th largest country by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) joined the European Union on June 1, 2007.[1]  Bulgaria's currency is the Bulgarian Lev (BGN), which was exchanged at 1.3 Lev per U.S. Dollar (USD) in 2008.[1]  Since 2004, Bulgaria's economy has averaged more than 6% annual growth, attracting significant amounts of new foreign direct investment  investment.[1]  Between 2004 and 2008, foreign direct investment grew by 19.6% driven primarily by increased investments in Bulgaria's Real Estate, Energy, and Manufacturing sectors.[2][3]
Bulgaria's agriculture, industry, and services sectors account for 4.6%, 28.7%, and  66.7% of its GDP, respectively.[1]  Bulgaria's primary agricultural crops include wheat, corn, barley, sugar beats, sunflowers and various fruits.[1]  The country's dominant industries are Mining and Energy.  Bulgaria's abundant natural resources like copper, lead, zinc, and  coal are Bulgaria's main exports, accounting for 11.4% of Bulgaria's exports in 2008.[3]  Additionally, over 40% of Bulgaria's energy is generated from coal.[4]  Bulgaria's energy production industry accounts for 18.2% of the country's overall industrial GDP as its Southeast Europe's primary exporter of electricity.[5] Bulgaria's services sector is mainly comprised of financial services and tourism.[5]  In particular, Bulgaria's natural landscapes attract almost 6 million visitors annually which contribute significantly to Bulgaria's economic growth.[6]
However, corruption in Bulgaria's public administration and the presence of organized crime remain challenges to Bulgaria's economic development.[1]  Furthermore, Bulgaria's relatively high  inflation rate (7.8% in 2008) and dependence on foreign direct investment impedes its economic growth.[1]

 Stock Exchange
The Bulgarian Stock Exchange or Sofia had a market capitalization of BGN 12.46 billion at the end of 2008, down 57% from a year earlier because of the global economic downturn.[22]

 Trends and Forces
 Cheap, Well-Educated Labor and Bargain Real Estate Provide Investment Advantages
Bulgaria's cheap labor and resources, coupled with favorable corporate tax rates render Bulgaria as somewhat of an investment haven.  The average Bulgarian monthly salary is $165, compared to the EU average of $2,396.[23]  Additionally, Bulgarians spend 14 years on average in school and 98.2% of the country's population is literate.[23]  This cheap, well-educated labor helps minimize companies' labor costs without compromising the education and productivity of its employees.  Furthermore, Bulgaria's corporate tax rate reaches 0% in some regions, maintaining higher profit margins for firms.[23]

 Bulgaria's Heavy Dependence on Foreign Direct Investment Jeopardizes Economic Growth
Because of its reliance on foreign investment to foster economic growth, Bulgaria's economy is vulnerable to any downturns in the global economy that would reduce lending.  In 2008, foreign investments accounted for 18% of Bulgaria's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), ranking highest in the European Union in amount of foreign investments as share of GDP[24]  In January 2009 foreign direct investments dropped 37% from a year earlier because of credit constraints associated with the 2008 Financial Crisis.[25]  In particular, foreign investment in Bulgaria's Real Estate industry declined 66% in January 2009.[25]  Stoyan Stalev, chief of Bulgaria's association of investments expects that the global financial crisis may reduce foreign direct investment in Bulgaria by up to 50% in 2009.[26]  As a result, The Economist believes that Bulgaria's GDP growth will decrease by 3.8% during the year.[3]
Compounding Bulgaria's investment woes is its large Current account deficit- in 2008, Bulgaria's current-account deficit totaled $11.7 billion or 23.4% of GDP, up from 22% of GDP in 2007.[3]  A high current-account deficit is bad for Bulgaria because it exacerbates their preexisting financial needs and may decrease foreign investor confidence.  However, the 2008 Financial Crisis has reduced imports to Bulgaria and as a result, Bulgaria's current-account deficit has decreased as well- in 2009 the IMF expects that Bulgaria's deficit will shrink to 13.9% of GDP.[3]

 High Corruption Rates Stifle Investment and Economic Growth in Bulgaria
Bulgaria's corruption issues throughout its judicial and financial institutions continue to impede its economic growth.  Significant amounts of foreign aid and investment is lost or stolen each year due to corruption and fraud.[3]  For example, 54% of respondents in a 2009 Transparency International survey indicated their beliefs that Bulgarian businesses pay bribes to secure favorable legislative decisions.[27]  Because of these issues, the European Commission froze €800 million or about $1.1 billion in aid in 2009, with options of canceling the aid entirely.[28]

"With HUGE volume on AAPL and RIMM for 2 days, everyone in a trading room was whining about freezes, crashes and lag with *******, RealTick, TS and Cyber.  InvestorRT with IQFeed was rock solid.  I mean SOLID!" - Comment from Public IRC Chat
"IQFeed version 4 is a real screamer compared to anything else I have seen." - Comment from Tom
"I was with ******* for 4 years at $230 a month, this is a huge savings for me, GOD BLESS YOU PEOPLE," - Comment from T.S. via Email
"I am very happy I changed.  I love the product, but more so I am thrilled with Tech Support.  You are knowledgeable, polite,  pleasant and professional." - Comment from Pat
"I noticed that ******* quotes locked up shortly after the interest rate announcement yesterday while yours stayed stable." - Comment from Ron in Utah
"I just wanted to tell you what a fine job you have been doing.  While *******, from what I hear, has been down and out, off and on,  IQ feed has held like a champ this week." - Comment from Shirin
"You have an excellent product !!!!!!" - Comment from Arely
"There is no doubt that IQFeed is the best data provider. I am very satisfied with your services. And IQFeed is the only one that I would recommend to my friends. Now, most of them are using your product in China." - Comment from Zhezhe
"I'm satisfied with IQFeed. It's the most reliable and fastest quote feed I have ever used. Although I'm a resident in China, it's still very fast!" - Comment from Xiaofei
"My broker in Davenport suggested I give you a try as he uses your service and says its the best." - Comment from Bill via RT Chat
"You are much better than lawyers or the phone company because you answer the phone when I call!  I just love your customer service." - Comment from Isreal
"Awesome response, as usual.  It is a sincere and refreshing pleasure to do business with DTN, compared to your competition." - Comment from Ryan
"I started a trial a few weeks back before the market went wild. DTN.IQ didn’t miss anything and beat my other provider. I decided to stay with you because of the great service through all the volatility." - Comment from Mike
"If you want customer service that answers the phone, your best bet is IQFeed. I cannot stop praising them or their technical support. They are always there for you, and they are quick.  I have used ****** too but the best value is IQFeed." - Comment from Public Forum
"If you are serious about your trading I would not rely on IB data for serious daytrading.  Took me a while to justify the cost of IQ Feed and in the end, it's just a 2 point stop on ES.   Better safe than sorry" - Comment from Public Forum
"Thanks for the great product and support. During this week of high volume trading, my QuoteTracker + IQ Feed setup never missed a beat. Also, thanks for your swiftness in responding to data issues. I was on ******* for a few years before I made the switch over early this year, and wish I had done it a long time ago." - Comment from Ken
"Thank God for your Data Feed as the only Zippers I see are on my pants (LOL), and no more 200 pip spikes to mess up charts." - Comment from Spiro via Email
"This is an excellent value, the system is generous (allowing for 500 stocks) and stable (and really is tick-by-tick), and the support is fantastic." - Comment from Shirin via Email
"As a past ******* customer(and not a happy one), IQ Feed by DTN is a much better and cheaper product with great customer support. I have had no problems at all since switching over." - Comment from Public Forum
"I had always used ******* but for the past 2 weeks have been trying DTN IQFeed. Customer support has been extraordinary. They call just to make sure your problem hasn't recurred." - Comment from Public Forum
"I just wanted to let u know that your data feed/service is by far the best!!! Your unfiltered tick data is excellent for reading order flow and none of your competitors delivers this quality of data!" - Comment from Peter via Email
"I was on the phone with a friend who uses CQG and right after the Fed announcement, CQG was as much as 30 seconds behind DTN.IQ.  Some quotes were off by as much as 15-18 cents.  Your feed never missed a beat." - Comment from Roger
"Interactive Brokers tick data was inconsistent, so I have switched to using DTN exclusively.  It is great to no longer have to worry about my datafeed all day long." - Comment from Philippe
"I've been using IQFeed 4 in a multi-threaded situation for the last week or two on 2600 symbols or so with 100 simultaneous daily charts, and I have had 100% responsiveness." - Comment from Scott
"This beats the pants off CQG,  I am definitely switching to the ProphetX 3.0!" - Comment from Stephen
"I have to tell you though that using the IQFeed API is about the easiest and cleanest I have seen for some time." - Comment from Jim
"I am enjoying the feed very much - so superior to the broker provided feed I was previously using." - Comment from George
"I "bracket trade" all major news releases and I have not found one lag or glitch with DTN.IQ feed. I am very comfortable with their feed under all typical news conditions (Fed releases, employment numbers, etc)." - Comment from Public Forum
"If someone needs the best quality data and backfill beyond what their broker provides at a rate that is the best in the industry, I highly recommend IQFeed." - Comment from Josh via Public Forum
"I used to have *******, but they are way more money for the same thing.  I have had no probs with data from DTN since switching over." - Comment from Public Forum Post
"I am a hedge fund manager here. It’s funny, I have a Bloomberg terminal and a Bridge feed, but I still like having my DTN feed!" - Comment from Feras
"Version 4.0.0.2 has been working well for me and I appreciate that it is now a much tighter client to work with.  I feel I can go to press with my own application and rely on a stable platform" - Comment from David in IA.
"I will tell others who want to go into trading that DTN ProphetX is an invaluable tool, I don't think anyone can trade without it..." - Comment from Luther
"Boy, probably spent a thousand hours trying to get ******* API to work right. And now two hours to have something running with IQFeed. Hmmm, guess I was pretty stupid to fight rather than switch all this time. And have gotten more customer service from you guys already than total from them… in five years." - Comment from Jim
"I am very pleased with the DTNIQ system for quotes and news." - Comment from Larry
"It’s so nice to be working with real professionals!" - Comment from Len
"Everything is working great ! Very impressive client. The news refreshes better and is more pertinent than the ******* feed I paid $ 100/month for. I Also like the charts a lot." - Comment from Leon
"I would just like to say that IQFeed version 4 is running very well and I am very happy with its performance.  I would also like to extend a big thanks for the fast and efficient help that I always receive.  My questions and concerns are always addressed promptly.  Way to go!" - Comment from Josh in CO.
"After all the anxiety I had with my previous data provider it is a relief not to have to worry about data speed and integrity." - Comment from Eamonn
"DTN feed was the only feed that consistently matched Bloomberg feed for BID/ASK data verification work these past years......DTN feed is a must for my supply & demand based trading using Cumulative Delta" - Comment from Public Forum Post
"I've never had DTN go out on me since switching.  ******* would go down a couple times every month when I was using them." - Comment from Bryce in AL.
"DTN has never given me problems. It is incredibly stable. In fact I've occasionally lost the data feed from Interactive Brokers, but still been able to trade because I'm getting good data from DTN." - Comment from Leighton
"I'm very glad I switched to IQFeed.  It's working perfectly with no lag, even during fast market conditions." - Comment from Andy via Email
"I ran your IQFeed DDE vs. my broker vs. a level II window for some slow-moving options.  I would see the level II quote change, then your feed update instantaneously.  My broker's DDE, however, would take as much as 30 seconds to update.  I am not chasing milliseconds, but half a minute is unacceptable." - Comment from Rob
"The service is great, I see a noticeable improvement in my volume profiles over [broker]'s data feed" - Comment from Larry
"I like you guys better than *******...much more stable and a whole lot fewer issues." - Comment from Philip
"Just a quick one to say I'm very impressed so far :) The documentation for developers is excellent and I've quickly managed to get an app written to do historical downloads. The system is very robust and pretty quick considering the extent of data that's available. The support guys have been very helpful too, in combination with the forums it's been plain sailing so far!" - Comment from Adam
"IQ feed is brilliant. The support is mind-bending.  What service!" - Comment from Public Forum Post
"Its working FABULOUSLY for me!!  Holy cow...there has been so much I've been missing lately, and with this feed and Linnsoft software...I'm in the game now." - Comment from Chris R.
"Can I get another account from you?  I am tired of ******* going down so often" - Comment from George
"IQ feed works very well, does not have all of the normal interruptions I have grown used to on *******" - Comment from Mark
"Thanks for all of your help. Great customer service deserves to be recognized which one the reasons I've been a customer of DTN for over 10 years!" - Comment from Stuart
"I just wanted to say how happy I am with your service.  I was able to download the API docs last week and I was able to replicate Interactive Brokers historical bar queries and realtime bar queries over the weekend.  That was about one of the fastest integrations that I've ever done and it works perfectly!!!!" - Comment from Jason via Email
"And by the way, have to say this. I love the IQFeed software. It's rock solid and it has a really nice API." - Comment from Thomas via RT Chat
"I cannot believe what a difference it makes trading with ProphetX!" - Comment from Bruce in Los Angeles
"I just wanted to let you know how fast and easy I found it to integrate IQFeed into our existing Java code using your JNI client.  In my experience, such things almost never go so smoothly - great job!" - Comment from Nate
"I've been using Neoticker RT with IQFeed for two months, and I'm very happy with both of the products (I've had IQFeed for two years with very few complaints). The service from both companies is exceptional." - Comment from Public Forum
"Everything is working great with the API. I love it." - Comment from Calvin
"Just a thank you for the very helpful and prompt assistance and services.  You provided me with noticeably superior service in my setup compared to a couple of other options I had looked at." - Comment from John
"For anyone considering using DTN.IQ for a data feed, my experience with the quality of data and the tech support has been very positive." - Comment from Public Forum
"I have been using IQFeed now for a few years in MultiCharts and I have zero complaints. Very, very rare to have any data hiccups or anything at all go wrong." - Comment from Public Forum
"Thank you so much - awesome feed, awesome service!" - Comment from Greg via Email
"Everything is working amazing now. I'm already impressed with the true-tick feed of IQFeed and it's ability to support my 480 symbol layout." - Comment from Tyler via Email
"Very impressed with the quality of your feed - ******* is a real donkey in comparison." - Comment from A.C. via Email
"You are either overstaffed or people just don't have problems with your feed because customer support always answers the phone quickly." - Comment from Jay via Email
"Excellent datafeed !!!" - Comment from Arely
"I use IQ Feed,  Great stuff as far as data analysis information, storage and retrieval is concerned." - Comment from Public Forum
"I am keeping IQFeed, much better reliabilty than *******.  I may refer a few other people in the office to switch as well." - Comment from Don
"Thanks for following up with me.  You guys do a great job in tech support." - Comment from Phelps
"You have an excellent feed.  Very few spikes for Spot Forex." - Comment from Public Forum Post
"Previously I was using *******. IQFeed is WAY more economical, and for my charting needs is just as good, if not better." - Comment from Public Forum Post
"The people at Nirvana have very nice things to say about your company and I can see why!  Price and service is a potent combination." - Comment from Ed
