1 The latest income date allowed is age 95, which is the required age to annuitize or take a lump sum. Please see the prospectus for important information regarding the annuitization of a contract.
2 Annual asset-based charges include a mortality and expense charge of 0.85% and an administration charge of 0.15% as an annual percentage of the average daily net asset value of the variable investment options, plus a $50 ($30 in New York) annual contract maintenance charge, waived for contract anniversary values and surrender values of $50,000 or more. (Administration charge is waived if the contract value on the later of the issue date or the most recent contract quarterly anniversary is greater than or equal to $1 million.)
3 Withdrawal charges are expressed as a percentage of premium payments and are based on the number of completed years since each premium payment. Upon a full or partial withdrawal taken on or after age 88 of the owner, withdrawal charge percentages applied will be less than those in the normal duration of the schedule. (Not applicable in New York.)
4 If the liquidity option is elected, the fixed account options are not available. The optional liquidity benefit is available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity. It is important to note that the charges for this optional benefit are charged for the life of the contract.
5 The range is based on the estimated expenses reflected for each of the portfolios in the current prospectus and subsequent prospectus supplements. Please see the prospectus to determine the charge associated with a specific investment option.
6 There may be periods when Jackson restricts the amount of premium payments into, and the amount and frequency of transfers between, into and from any fixed account option; to close any fixed account option; and to require transfers from a fixed account option. If the transfer restriction is imposed, then transfers from the 1-Year Fixed Account in the first contract year may not exceed one-third of the value of the fixed account; if the maximum transfer amount has been transferred in the previous contract year, in the following contract year transfers may not exceed one-half of the value of the fixed account. If the maximum transfer amount has been transferred in both of the two prior contract years, the remaining value of the fixed account may be transferred the next contract year. Transfers may not begin until 12 months after the last transfer. If the restrictions are imposed, you may elect automatic rebalancing, but the 1-Year Fixed Account may not be included in the allocation. The interest rates credited to the fixed accounts are backed by the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company® or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York®. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency from which this annuity is purchased or any affiliates of those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company and Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York. Withdrawals from a fixed account prior to the end of the fixed period may be subject to withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York), where applicable, which may reduce the contract value. The 1- and 3-Year Fixed Account options are currently not available.
7 Systematic investment programs do not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. They involve continuous investing regardless of fluctuating price levels. You should consider your ability to continue investing through periods of fluctuating market conditions. May not be available in all states.
8 To prevent abusive trading practices, Jackson restricts the frequency of transfers among variable investment options.
9 If fixed account restrictions are imposed, the owner may elect automatic rebalancing, but the 1-Year Fixed Account may not be included in the allocation.
10 Withdrawals that exceed the free withdrawal may be subject to withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York), where applicable, which may reduce the contract value. Although free withdrawals reduce the contract value, they do not reduce remaining premium. As a result, you will not receive the benefit of a free withdrawal if you take a full withdrawal.
State variations may apply.




What is a Variable Annuity?
Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.

Before investing, investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses, which are contained in the same document, provide this and other important information. Please contact your representative or the Company to obtain the prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money.

The latest income date allowed is age 95, which is the required age to annuitize or take a lump sum. Please see the prospectus for important information regarding the annuitization of a contract.
The standard death benefit is equal to contract value on the date of the claim and does not include any additional guarantees.
Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and may be found at a lower cost in other investment products. It also may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.
The investment companies (subaccounts) offered in Elite Access are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"), and their shares are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. There are many differences among 1940 Act registered subaccounts and unregistered hedge funds, including but not limited to liquidity, restrictions on leverage and diversification, fund reporting and transparency, fees, and availability.
Elite Access Variable and Fixed Annuity (VA650, VA660) is issued by Jackson National Life Insurance Company® (Home Office: Lansing, Michigan) and in New York (VA650NY, VA660NY) by Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® (Home Office: Purchase, New York). Variable annuities are distributed by Jackson National Life Distributors LLC, member FINRA. May not be available in all states and state variations may apply. This product has limitations and restrictions, including withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York) where applicable. Jackson issues other variable annuities with similar features, benefits, limitations and charges. Discuss them with your representative or contact Jackson for more information.
Jackson® is the marketing name for Jackson National Life Insurance Company® and Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York®.
Certain contract terms, such as maximum issue age, liquidity, and nonqualified premium may vary by firm.
