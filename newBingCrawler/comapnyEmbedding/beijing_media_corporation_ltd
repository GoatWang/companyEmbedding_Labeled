	Beijing Media Corporation Limited operates in the Advertising agencies sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Beijing Media Corporation Limited with three other
	
			companies in this sector in China:
		
	Dahe Media Company Limited
	
		(2016
	sales of 596.37 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$88.30  million]
		),
	
	Chinanet Online Holdings, Incorporation
	
		(231.20 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$34.23  million]
		), and
	
	Branding China Group
	
		(160.37 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$23.75  million]
		of which 94%
		was Traditional Advertising).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	Beijing Media Corporation Limited reported sales of 475.15 million Chinese Renmimbi (US$70.35 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 5.3%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 501.81 million Chinese Renmimbi.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 53.0% decline
		in Distribution, from 4.56 million Chinese Renmimbi to 2.15 million Chinese Renmimbi.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Advertising (down 15.2% to 211.05 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Trading of Print-Related Materials (down 13.4% to 172.71 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Printing (down 37.3% to 11.37 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Network Technical Services (up 266.5% to 25.23 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Unallocated (up 93.5% to 60.80 million Chinese Renmimbi)
