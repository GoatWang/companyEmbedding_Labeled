The Most Reliable Latching Relays in the Market
            
For more than a decade, KG Technologies has specialized in the development and manufacturing of high-powered, high-quality latching relays. We offer a line of latching relays spanning from 5A to 200A for both single-phase and polyphase switching purposes. Designed, built, and tested to meet the industry's highest performance standards, KG Technologies' relays offer the best value in the energy management market. 
We develop technology using innovative ways to save energy and money for both producers and 
              consumers of electricity. We take pride in having one of the lowest failure rates              in the industry. For the customer, this
              translates into a significant savings in
              costs and minimizes the number of
              costly field service trips.

Product Listings: Review our product listings  using the menus on the left and see how KG Technologies can meet your switching needs. 
Data Sheet Glossary: Each of the KG Technologies' latching relays has its own specific data sheet available for download by searching our product listings (available in the menus on the left).   KG Technologies' engineering  team provides a helpful Data Sheet Glossary of terms for understanding the various technical aspects of our informative data sheets. 

 
Switching To A Greener Tomorrow™

Success Story
"Smaller Yet More Powerful"

 
Challenge:
            Our latest challenge required delivering more performance from a smaller and safer latching relay for the multi-year, multi-million smart meter rollouts in two major European markets.

Solution:
            To meet the stricter short circuit and dielectric requirements of the French and UK markets, our team designed the smaller, yet more powerful K125—a fully-certified UC3 100A latching relay.
Rated at 277VAC, the K125 remains functional even after a 6000A short circuit and exceeds all safety standards. The K125 is just one example of how KG Technologies achieves cost-to-performance balance within its design methodology.

Results:
            We were able to reduce the size of our latching relays while also improving relay performance at a advantageous price point – all with fully compliant UC3 relays. 
This achievement has positioned us well to support both the French and UK metering market demands over the next 10 years.

Data Call Technologies, Inc. - New Product Release 



FRIENDSWOOD, TX--(Marketwired - Mar 22, 2016) -  Data Call Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: DCLT) (the "Company" or "Data Call") is a company specializing in the production, curation, aggregation and delivery of news and information content for the Digital Signage and Corporate Communication industries. The Company has been recognized by its peers as a pioneer with the wide range of its product offerings for the Digital Signage space since the early part of this decade. 
Last week the Company displayed its core content offerings of News, Sports and Weather at the 2016 Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. As promised earlier, Data Call followed through and released a sizeable amount of new products qualifying to part of their tag line "...and a whole lot more" at the Expo. All of the added products are playlist ready video and/or motion graphics, formatted for full screen viewing. 
In the General Interest category http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/general-interest/, the company added "Travel", "Animal Facts", "Picture Trivia", and an "HD Quote of the day".
In the Video category, the company introduced a Video in Demand editorial product "DCFlix ViD" http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/video/ 
The Company has also added a completely new category -- Health and Wellness. http://www.datacalltech.com/health-and-wellness/. This is an evidence based category including "Healthy Eating", "Wellness Top 10s", "Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables", "Healthy Workforce", and "Did you Know?" content.
Tim Vance, the company's CEO, stated, "I am extremely happy with the activity resulting from this year's expo. Our timing is on point with the addition of these latest products. The DS networks are now built and running. Networks and end users alike are in search of engaging content. Relevant, dynamic content. Check! We've got it. As we have been preaching -- Feed the Beast! Over the last couple of years, we have seen DS integration with smart phones. We are now witnessing the full circle between of both Digital Signage and Mobile products. It is not a battle of devices, yet a special harmony of the two. Our content keeps the DS screens fresh and vibrant while the network operators focus on their direct message to their audiences and integration with smart devices for rewards programs, recognition, and full viewer engagement. We empower the DS operators to leave the bulk of the content to us while they focus on other initiatives within their network's reach. The addition of this latest content has immediately opened doors to sectors that we have in the past struggled for presence in. It is a very exciting time for the company."
