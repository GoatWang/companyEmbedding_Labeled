		The rise of network-based, automated services in the past decade has definitely changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.

Fortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as "identity management architecture" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.

Author Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.

How does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.

Identity-Related Products and Services
Convenient, Professional Nationwide Locations
 
MorphoTrust has been providing fingerprinting services for well over a decade, building a nationwide network of enrollment centers in support of many state and federal agency contracts. Over the years, we have seen the need for a broader range of identity-related products and services to better serve the millions of customers that come to our centers. To meet this need, MorphoTrust launched the IdentoGO Centers to serve a growing number of consumers through professional, trained staff in comfortable, convenient environments. Gone are the days of  having to be fingerprinted in a police station to apply for a job or professional certification.
 
With our primary goal of excellent service, we have been adding new products and services to our Centers, helping customers cross more items off their lists in one trip. Offerings vary by location. Please visit www.identogo.com to find a location near you and check out the services provided.

 The rise of network-based, automated services in the past decade has definitely changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.Fortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as "identity management architecture" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.Author Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.How does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsConfusing technology with delivery managementBySeetharama Rao V. Durbhaon January 6, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThough this book covers some basic issues surrounding identity management, the architecture part is very weak. What I felt is that the author is confusing delivery management with the technology itself. Major sections of the book (under the guise of governance) are devoted to people and expectation management and politics rather than technology. Majority of what is discussed is applicable universally to execution of any project in any decent sized organization. Not that this books has nothing to offer on IMA itself - but it is too generic and very little on actual technology.Read more0Comment|

Complete and easy to understandByMauricio Nuneson November 15, 2012Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThe book presents all the characteristics, goals and challenges when we think on Identity Management.I work in a IM project and this book made clear a lot of gaps I had in my knowledge. Also, it helped me to understand the real importance of a good identity management infrastructure for the organization as a whole, not only for IT.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsIncomplete, and lacks the practical sideByCeSingeon July 4, 2013Format: Kindle EditionI selected this book based on an upcoming IAM project I'd be involved in, and on Amazon reader recommendations (overly positive, as it turns out). The book, written around 2003 is a bit outdated in some points, but this is not too much of an issue given its focus: governance, broad principles of identity management, high level theoretical guidelines of architecture. Sure, it is a good refresh of the high level governance principles that should guide identity management projects from a managerial perspective.But the book clearly lacks substance when it comes to the practical implementation. While it is of some help during the planning phase of IM projects, it essentially stops where one wants to start. Conceptual approach, theoretical design, planning are one thing. Implementing is another, totally absent here. The book will not help in areas like dimensioning, practical issues and pitfalls, product evaluation, actual design and architecture, ROI, cost vs benefit and such. It is totally lacking any How To?The book starts the traditional way: explaining what digital identity is. This is followed by about 8 chapters about the constituents of identity management, including authentication, trust, integrity, non-repudiation, and even digital rights management. Except for a very brief refresher, I think these have no place here and they should have been summarized in one single chapter. Other books treat this much better, and many readers will find this part to be a somewhat boring given it is background knowledge for any CISSP-level security person. The DRM chapter (Chapter 10), and some other parts in this area are even irrelevant, in my view.This first part is followed by two chapters on (11) Interoperability Standards and (12) Federating Identity. Here again, the Interoperability Standards goes into unneeded technical details and misses the point. It is not giving the reader an understanding of the real issues: interoperability for what purpose? What are the issues? How can we go about them?On the other hand, the Federating Identity chapter should probably be substantially expanded, as it is the meat of what identity management is about today. Three or four chapters should probably be devoted to this, and they should include practical examples of scenarios, architectures. It should be shown why identity federation is key, but again, the chapter does not go beyond very high-level and theoretical principles.Finally, the book concludes with about eight chapters on architecture, governance, policies and such. While these give an idea of what is required in a well governed enterprise with an advanced maturity model, once again, these chapters lack real practical usability. In addition, this part is really not specific to identity management, but is rather a short summary of what has to be done in terms of governance, enterprise and reference architectures, and policy management.Having read the book, I'm kind of disappointed. Facing a real project on identity management, the reader will surely think. Good, and now, what do we do? Possibly, it may make happy the high-level manager only seeking to understand what identity management is about, with no intention to get involved in the project.This other reader, Prasad Reddy, summarizes it very well: "The book absolutely fails and falls short on explaining the identity management standards and technologies related to single sign-on, federation, provisioning and assurance. From a real-world IDMS deployment perspective the book is truly misleading !". Why so many gave it 4 or 5 stars is unclear. I'd hesitate between 2 and 3.Useless, no, but I will still have to look out for something more useable in real life.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood introduction to IMAByBen Rothkeon November 15, 2005Format: PaperbackMany people who review their credit report for the first time are shocked to learn how many identities are linked to them. Even when there is no problem of identity theft, it is not uncommon for people to have 10 or more names linked to their credit reports due to various errors, including permutation of their name.Just as it is difficult to maintain and manage identities in the real world, it is difficult to maintain and manage digital identities. As the digital economy is becoming more ubiquitous, the need for a single federated identity is becoming more critical. In Digital Identity, Phillip Windley details the steps needed to develop an identity management architecture (IMA).Identity management has become a pressing need in the past few years. This has come about because networks and systems are no longer geared around a single infrastructure, and businesses have become increasingly virtual and decentralized. In previous years, there were simply internal users. Today, systems have internal users, along with external users such as consultants, contractors, third-parties, customers, collaborators, and many more. Such requirements necessitate a well-designed and planned IMA.So what is this thing called IMA? Windley defines an IMA as the coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications, and management activities that enable an organization to effectively manage digital identities.IMA is also known as federated identity. The book notes that the real challenge in developing a federated identity infrastructure is dealing with the various different hardware and software platforms where user accounts reside, and working with different organizations and departments, including the ever-increasing amount of outsourcing. When all of that is put together, a single federated identity is not easy to come by if there is not an IMA in place.The beauty of an IMA is that it allows an organization to securely link and exchange identity information across partner, supplier, and customer organizations, while having a single architecture. This makes identity management seamless.The first 11 chapters of Digital Identity do a good job of introducing the underlying concepts of an IMA, including security, trust, authentication, access control, and names and directories. Without an effective security infrastructure in place, any IMA deployed will not be fully effective.One oddity, though, is that in Chapter 6, the author defines cryptography as the science of making the cost of discovery of hidden information greater than the value of the information itself. This is the author's own characterization of cryptography and while interesting, is not how it is used in mainstream security.Chapter 12 starts to get into the internals of federated identities. This and the rest of the chapters do not deal with the deep technical details of an IMA, rather it shows how to design and deploy the IMA in a context of a corporate environment under a single set of policies and procedures. Windley emphasizes that an IMA is not so much a technical issue, but rather a business issue that must be deployed in a business context.This idea of a business context is manifest in Chapter 18, which deals with identity policies. The book creates what it calls an IMA policy stack, which is the interoperability framework for the IMA. The stack includes all of the elements necessary for the IMA, and comprises an identity management architecture, framework, and set of standards. The standards include all protocols and applications, from SSL, XML, LDAP, DNS, and much more. The framework includes policy issues such as naming, passwords, encryption, provisioning, and more. Finally, the architecture details the specific high-level controls (procurement, contracts, licensing, etc.) around the IMA.The book itself is worth it solely for the information in this chapter. Anyone attempting to deploy an IMA without first getting a handle on the issues details in Chapter 18 will find that their IMA will likely be seriously deficient.The only negatives to the book are a few too many editing mistakes that should have been caught during the editing process. Also, the author frequently discusses his own trials and tribulations of using an IMA during his short stint as CIO of the State of Utah and with previous employers. Depending on the readers' specific tastes, some my find the heavy use of the first-person anecdotes to be a negative.Overall, Digital Identity provides the reader with a good introduction to the various areas necessary to develop a productive identity management infrastructure. Anyone planning to deploy an IMA or any sort of federated identity solution in a corporate environment will find Digital Identity a valuable reference.Read more0Comment|

Help! I can’t access the Verisign Customer Center.
                                



The Verisign Customer Center is an online portal for partners to find technical details on implementation, including SDKs. Access to this portal is subject to NameStore credentials and access restrictions. If you are unable to connect to the Verisign Customer Center, please email customer support. 




Help! My domain name expired.
                                



Verisign operates several domain name registries; however, we are not a registrar. If your domain name expired, you need to contact your registrar about renewing. If you don’t know who your registrar is, you may search the Whois database for your domain name. The results will show the registrar responsible for registering your domain name so that you can contact them.




How do I become a registrar?
                                



To become a registrar, you’ll need to go through a certification process. Different top-level domains (TLDs) have different requirements and processes and some TLDs require ICANN accreditation. Get all the details about certification for Verisign supported gTLDs in our Become a Registrar section. 




What are these new generic top-level domains I’ve been hearing about?
                                



With the ICANN New gTLD Program, the number of top-level domains (TLDs) will grow to nearly 2000.  Verisign applied for 14 new gTLDs and has been selected to serve as the Back End Registry Services (BERS) provider for approximately 200 other new gTLDs that have or will launch in the near future. Learn more about new gTLDs.




How do I register an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)?
                                



If you own a website or provide other Internet-based services and would like to use Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) to help your customers, you may register an IDN in available characters through participating ICANN-accredited and Verisign-certified registrars. A registrant requests an IDN from a registrar that supports IDNs. The registrar converts the local language characters into a sequence of supported characters using ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE). The registrar submits the ACE string to the Verisign® Shared Registration System (SRS) where it is verified and encoded. The IDN is added to the appropriate TLD zone files and propagated across the Internet. Find a Registrar.

How do I know if I’m experiencing a DDoS attack?
                                



A denial of service (DoS) attack occurs when traffic is sent from one host to another computer with the intent of disrupting an online application or service. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple hosts (such as compromised PCs that are part of a “botnet”) are used to carry out and amplify an attack. Attackers usually create the denial-of-service condition by either consuming server bandwidth or impairing the server itself. Typical targets include Web servers, DNS servers, application servers, routers, firewalls and Internet bandwidth.

The operational challenge of securing this information, without negatively impacting efficiency, was of utmost concern," said PXInfosec General Manager Eric Ren. "With this innovative network folder encryption solution, we not only secure their key data and intellectual property, but we do so in a cost-efficient, non-invasive manner. It’s an invaluable tool."
As part of the agreement, PXInfosec will purchase 20,000 licenses of Entrust Entelligence Group Share. The innovative network folder encryption solution, which was launched in 2007, offers organizations a seamless method of implementing easy-to-use encryption for group files or folders. As a transparent and persistent solution, the contents remain encrypted regardless if copied or moved to another drive, network or device.
"As information loss and data breach become an alarmingly frequent occurrence, it’s reassuring to know that security-conscious organizations like PXInfosec are enabling customers to protect their sensitive assets or intellectual property," said Entrust Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Conner. "As a key component of a layered security approach, this network folder encryption solution provides organizations with one-of-a-kind capabilities that not only secure information, but increase productivity and efficiency in a cost-effective manner."
