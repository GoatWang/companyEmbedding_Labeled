		The rise of network-based, automated services in the past decade has definitely changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.

Fortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as "identity management architecture" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.

Author Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.

How does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.

In a marketing, a product is anything that can be offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need.[1] In retailing, products are called merchandise. In manufacturing, products are bought as raw materials and sold as finished goods. A service is another common product type.
Commodities are usually raw materials such as metals and agricultural products, but a commodity can also be anything widely available in the open market. In project management, products are the formal definition of the project deliverables that make up or contribute to delivering the objectives of the project. In insurance, the policies are considered products offered for sale by the insurance company that created the contract. In economics and commerce, products belong to a broader category of goods. The economic meaning of product was first used by political economist Adam Smith.[citation needed]
A related concept is that of a sub-product, a secondary but useful result of a production process.
Dangerous products, particularly physical ones, that cause injuries to consumers or bystanders may be subject to product liability.

Product classification[edit]
A product can be classified as tangible or intangible. A tangible product is a physical object that can be perceived by touch such as a building, vehicle, gadget, or clothing. An intangible product is a product that can only be perceived indirectly such as an insurance policy. Services can be broadly classified under intangible products which can be durable or non durable.
By use[edit]
In its online product catalog, retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company divides its products into "departments", then presents products to potential shoppers according to (1) function or (2) brand.[2] Each product has a Sears item-number and a manufacturer's model-number. Sears uses the departments and product groupings with the intention of helping customers browse products by function or brand within a traditional department-store structure.[3]
By association[edit]
A product line is "a group of products that are closely related, either because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same types of outlets, or fall within given price ranges."[4] Many businesses offer a range of product lines which may be unique to a single organization or may be common across the business's industry. In 2002 the US Census compiled revenue figures for the finance and insurance industry by various product lines such as "accident, health and medical insurance premiums" and "income from secured consumer loans".[5] Within the insurance industry, product lines are indicated by the type of risk coverage, such as auto insurance, commercial insurance and life insurance.[6]
National and international product classifications[edit]
Various classification systems for products have been developed for economic statistical purposes. The NAFTA signatories are working on a system that classifies products called NAPCS as a companion to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).[7] The European Union uses a "Classification of Products by Activity" among other product classifications.[8] The United Nations also classifies products for international economic activity reporting.[9]
The Aspinwall Classification System [10][11] classifies and rates products based on five variables:

Replacement rate (How frequently is the product repurchased?)
Gross margin (How much profit is obtained from each product?)
Buyer goal adjustment (How flexible are the buyers' purchasing habits with regard to this product?)
Duration of product satisfaction (How long will the product produce benefits for the user?)
Duration of buyer search behavior (How long will consumers shop for the product?)

The National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP)[12] developed a commodity and services classification system for use by state and local governments, the NIGP Code.[13] The NIGP Code is used by 33 states within the United States as well as thousands of cities, counties and political subdivisions. The NIGP Code is a hierarchical schema consisting of a 3 digit class, 5 digit class-item, 7 digit class-item-group and an 11 digit class-item-group-detail.[14] Applications of the NIGP Code include vendor registration, inventory item identification, contract item management, spend analysis and strategic sourcing.

Product model[edit]
A manufacturer usually provides an identifier for each particular type of product they make, known as a model, model variant, or model number (often abbreviated as MN, M/N or model no.). For example, Dyson Ltd, a manufacturer of appliances (mainly vacuum cleaners), requires customers to identify their model in the support section of the website.[15] Brand and model can be used together to identify products in the market. The model number is not necessarily the same as the manufacturer part number (MPN).[16]
Because of the huge amount of similar products in the automotive industry, there is a special kind of defining a car with options (marks, attributes), that represent the characteristics features of the vehicle. A model of a car is defined by some basic options like body, engine, gear box and axles. The variants of a model are built by some additional options like color, seats, wheels, mirrors, trims, entertainment and assistant systems etc. Options, that exclude each other (pairwise) build an option-family. That means, that you can choose only one option by each family and you have to choose exactly one option. This kind of product definition fulfill the requirements of an ideal Boolean Algebra and can be helpful to construct a product configurator.[17] Sometimes, a set of options (car features) are combined to an automotive package and are offered by a lower price. A consistent car definition is essential for the production planning and control in the automotive industry, to generate a master production schedule,[18] which is the fundamental for the enterprise resource planning.
In addition, a specific unit of a product is usually (and has to be) identified by a serial number, which is necessary to distinguish products with the same product definition. In the case of automotive products it's called the Vehicle Identification Number VIN, an international standardized format.

^ When an online Sears customer goes to the "Parts and accessories" section of the website to find parts for a particular Sears item, the "model number" field actually requires a Sears item number, not a manufacturer's model number. This is a typical problem with product codes or item codes that are internally assigned by a company but do not conform to an external standard.

Overview
To date, many technical decision makers in large IT environments have heard about the principles and benefits of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Despite this fact, very few IT organizations are yet able to translate the theoretical underpinnings of SOA into practical IT actions.
Over the last year, a few individual solution architects on my team have attempted to distill the practical essence of SOA into the following areas: Identity and Access Management, Service Management, Entity Aggregation and Process Integration. These four key technical areas present significant technical challenges to overcome but yet provide the critical IT foundations to help businesses realize the benefits of SOA.
Note that it is our frequent interactions with architects in the enterprises that enable us to collate, synthesize and categorize the practical challenges of SOA into these areas. Our team organizes the Strategic Architect Forums that are held multiple times worldwide annually. In these events, we conduct small discussion groups to find out the pain points and technical guidance customers are looking for. The feedback from our customers has been very consistent: issues in managing identities, aggregating data, managing services, and integrating business processes have been cited over and over again as major road blocks to realizing more efficient and agile organizations.
In addition, our team also conducts proof-of-concept projects with customers to drill deeper into the real world requirements and implementation issues. It is through these combinations of broad and deep engagements with customers that we on the Architecture Strategy team derived our conclusions on the four significant areas for IT to invest in. 
The key focus of this paper is to provide an overview of the technical challenges in one of those areas, namely identity and access management; and secondarily, to help the reader gain an understanding of the commonly encountered issues in this broad subject.
Introduction
Identity and access management (I&AM) is a relatively new term that means different things to different people. Frequently, IT professionals have tended to pigeonhole its meaning into certain identity and security related problems that they are currently faced with. For example, I&AM has been perceived to be a synonym for single sign-on, password synchronization, meta-directory, web single sign-on, role-based entitlements, and similar ideas.
The primary goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a succinct and comprehensive overview of what I&AM means. In order to accomplish this purpose, we have structured the information in this paper to help answer the following questions:


What is a digital identity?
What does identity and access management mean?
What are the key technology components of I&AM?
How do the components of I&AM relate to one another?
What are the key architecture challenges in IA&M?

Anatomy of a Digital Identity
Personal identifications in today's society can take many different forms. Some examples of these forms are driver licenses, travel passports, employee cardkeys, and club membership cards. These forms of identifications typically contain information that is somewhat unique to the holder, for example, names, address and photos, as well as information about the authorities that issued the cards, for example, an insignia of the local department of motor vehicles.
While the notion of identities in the physical world is fairly well understood, the same cannot be said about the definition of digital identities. To help lay the groundwork for the rest of the discussions in this paper, this section describes one notion of a digital identity, as illustrated in Figure 1. Our definition of digital identity consists of the following parts:


Identifier   A piece of information that uniquely identifies the subject of this identity within a given context.1 Examples of identifiers are email addresses, X500 distinguished names and Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs).
Credentials   Private or public data that could be used to prove authenticity of an identity claim. For example, Alice enters in a password to prove that she is who she says she is. This mechanism works because only the authentication system and Alice should know what the password for Alice is. A private key and the associated X509 public key certificate is another example of credentials.
Core Attribute   Data that help describe the identity. Core attributes may be used across a number of business or application contexts. For example, addresses and phone numbers are common attributes that are used and referenced by different business applications.
Context-specific Attributes   Data that help describe the identity, but which is only referenced and used within specific context where the identity is used. For example, within a company, the employee's preferred health plan information is a context specific attribute that is interesting to the company's health care provider but not necessarily so to the financial services provider. 


Figure 1. Anatomy of a digital identity
What is Identity and Access Management?
The Burton Group defines identity management as follows: "Identity management is the set of business processes, and a supporting infrastructure for the creation, maintenance, and use of digital identities."2
In this paper, we define identity and access management (I&AM) as follows:
"Identity and access management refers to the processes, technologies and policies for managing digital identities and controlling how identities can be used to access resources."
We can make a few important observations from the above definitions:


I&AM is about the end-to-end life cycle3 management of digital identities. An enterprise class identity management solution should not be made up of isolated silos of security technologies, but rather, consists of well integrated fabric of technologies that address the spectrum of scenarios in each stage of the identity life cycle. We will talk more about these scenarios in a later section of this paper. 
I&AM is not just about technology, but rather, is comprised of three indispensable elements: policies, processes and technologies. Policies refer to the constraints and standards that needs to be followed in order to comply with regulations and business best practices; processes describe the sequences of steps that lead to the completion of business tasks or functions; technologies are the automated tools that help accomplish business goals more efficiently and accurately while meeting the constraints and guidelines specified in the policies. 
The relationships between elements of I&AM can be represented as the triangle illustrated in Figure 2. Of significant interest is the fact that there is a feedback loop that links all three elements together. The lengths of the edges represent the proportions of the elements relative to one another in a given I&AM system. Varying the proportion of one element will ultimately vary the proportion of one or more other elements in order to maintain the shape of a triangle with a sweet spot (shown as an intersection in the triangle).
The triangle analogy is perfect for describing the relationships and interactions of policies, processes and technologies in a healthy I&AM system as well. Every organization is different and the right mix of technologies, policies and processes for one company may not necessarily be the right balance for a different company. Therefore, each organization needs to find its own balance represented by the uniqueness of its triangle. 
An organization's I&AM system does not remain static over time. New technologies will get introduced and adopted; new business models and constraints will change the corporate governance and processes to do things. As we mentioned before, when one of the elements change, it is time to find a new balance. It is consequently important to understand that I&AM is a journey, not a destination.

Identity and Access Management Framework
As implied in the previous sections, identity and access management is a very broad topic that covers both technology and non-technology areas. We will focus the rest of this paper around the technology aspects of identity and access management. 
To further contain the technical scope of this topic that is still sufficiently broad, it is useful to abide by some structure for our discussions. We will use the framework shown in Figure 3, which illustrates several key logical components of I&AM to lead the discussions on this subject. 
This particular framework highlighted three key "buckets" of technology components:


Identity life cycle management
Access management
Directory services

The components in these technology buckets are used to meet a set of recurring requirements in identity management solutions. We will describe the roles that these components play in the next few sections.
Directory Services
As mentioned previously, a digital identity consists of a few logical types of data—the identifier, credentials and attributes. This data needs to be securely stored and organized. Directory services provide the infrastructure for meeting such needs. Entitlements and security policies often control the access and use of business applications and computing infrastructure within an organization. Entitlements are the rights and privileges associated with individuals or groups. Security policies refer to the standards and constraints under which IT computing resources operate.
A password complexity policy is an example of a security policy. Another example is the trust configuration of a business application which may describe the trusted third party that the application relies upon to help authenticate and identify application users. Like digital identities, entitlements and security policies need to be stored, properly managed and discovered. In many cases, directory services provide a good foundation for satisfying these requirements.
Access Management
Access management refers to the process of controlling and granting access to satisfy resource requests. This process is usually completed through a sequence of authentication, authorization, and auditing actions. Authentication is the process by which identity claims are proven. Authorization is the determination of whether an identity is allowed to perform an action or access a resource. Auditing is the accounting process for recording security events that have taken place. Together, authentication, authorization, and auditing are also commonly known as the gold standards of security. (The reasoning behind this stems from the periodic symbol for Gold, 'Au'; the prefix for all three processes.) 
There are several technical issues that solutions architects may encounter when designing and integrating authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms into the application architecture:


Single Sign-On
Trust and Federation
User Entitlements
Auditing

We will describe these challenges and their solutions in more detail later on in this document.

Figure 3. Logical components of I&AM
Identity Life Cycle Management
The life cycle of a digital identity can be framed in similar stages to the life cycles of living things:


Creation
Utilization
Termination

Every stage in an identity's life cycle has scenarios that are candidates for automated management. For example, during the creation of a digital identity, the identity data needs to be propagated and initialized in identity systems. In other scenarios an identity's entitlements might need to be magnified when the user represented by the identity receive a job promotion.
Finally when the digital identity is no longer put to active use, its status might need to be changed or the identity might need to be deleted from the data store. 
All events during the life cycle of a digital identity need to be securely, efficiently, and accurately managed, which is exactly what identity life cycle management is about. 

Figure 4. Levels of identity life cycle management requirements
The requirements for identity life cycle management can be discussed at several levels, as represented in Figure 4. The types of data that need to be managed are shown at the identity data level. Based on our previous definitions of digital identity, the relevant data includes credentials, such as passwords and certificates; and user attributes, such as names, address and phone numbers. In addition to credentials and attributes, there are also user entitlements data to manage. These entitlements are described in more detail later on, but for now, entitlements should be considered as the rights and privileges associated with identities.
Moving up a level in the illustration, the requirements listed reflect the kinds of operations that can be performed on identity data. Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are data operation primitives coined by the database community. We reuse these primitives here as they provide a very convenient way for classifying the kinds of identity management operations. For example, we can classify changes to account status, entitlements, and credentials under the Update data primitive. 
The next level in the illustration shows two identity life cycle administration models: self-service and delegated. In traditional IT organizations, computer administration tasks are performed by a centralized group of systems administrators. Over time, organizations have realized that there may be good economic and business reasons to enable other kinds of administration models as well. For example, it is often more cost effective and efficient for individuals to be able to update some of their personal attributes, such as address and phone number, by themselves. The self-service administration model enables such individual empowerment. The middle ground between the self-service and centralized administration models is delegated administration. In the delegated model, the responsibilities of identity life cycle administration are shared between decentralized groups of administrators. The common criteria used to determine the scope of delegation are organization structure and administration roles. An example of delegated administration based on organization structure is the hierarchy of enterprise, unit and department level administrators in a large organization. 
The above life cycle administration models can be used to support a variety of business scenarios, some of which are listed in Figure 4. For instance, new employees often require accounts to be created and provisioned for them. Conversely, when an employee is no longer employed, the existing account status might need to be changed. Job change scenarios can also have several impacts on the digital identities. For example, when Bob receives a promotion, his title might need to be changed and his entitlements might need to be extended. Now that we have a better understanding of identity life cycle management requirements, we are ready to drill into the challenges involved in meeting those requirements.

Figure 5. Current state of affairs: multiple identity systems in the enterprise
The illustration in Figure 5 speaks to the fact that a typical user in an enterprise typically has to deal with multiple digital identities which might be stored and managed independently of one another. This current state of affairs is due to the ongoing evolution that every business organization goes through. Events such as mergers and acquisitions can introduce incompatible systems into the existing IT infrastructure; and evolving business requirements might have been met through third party applications that are not well integrated with existing ones.
One may presume that it would have been much easier for enterprises to deprecate the current systems and start over. However, this solution is seldom a viable option. We have to recognize that existing identity systems might be around for a long time, which leads us to find other solutions for resolving two key issues arising from managing data across disparate identity systems:


Duplication of information Identity information is often duplicated in multiple systems. For example, attributes such as addresses and phone numbers are often stored and managed in more than one system in an environment. When identity data is duplicated, it can easily get out of sync if updates are performed in one system but not the others. 
Lack of integration The complete view of a given user's attributes, credentials and privileges are often distributed across multiple identity systems. For example, for a given employee, the human resource related information might be contained in an SAP HR system, the network access account in an Active Directory and the legacy application privileges stored in a mainframe. Many identity life cycle management scenarios require identity information to be pulled from and pushed into several different systems. We refer to the above issues as the identity aggregation challenge, which we will describe in more detail in a later section.

Challenges in Identity and Access Management
Single Sign-On
A typical enterprise user has to login multiple times in order to gain access to the various business applications that they use in their jobs. From the user's point of view, multiple logins and the need to remember multiple passwords are some of the leading causes of bad application experiences. From the management point of view, forgotten password incidents most definitely increase management costs, and when combined with bad user password management habits (such as writing passwords down on yellow sticky notes,) can often lead to increased opportunities for security breaches. Because of the seemingly intractable problems that multiple identities present, the concept of single sign-on (SSO); the ability to login once and gain access to multiple systems, has become the 'Holy Grail' of identity management projects. 
Single Sign-On Solutions
Broadly speaking, there are five classes of SSO solutions. No one type of solution is right for every application scenario. The best solution is very much dependent on factors such as where the applications requiring SSO are hosted, limitations placed by the infrastructure (e.g. firewall restrictions), and the ability to modify the applications. These are the five categories of SSO solutions:


Web SSO
Operating System Integrated Sign-On
Federated Sign-On
Identity and Credential Mapping
Password Synchronization

Web SSO solutions are designed to address web application sign-on requirements. In these solutions, unauthenticated browser users are redirected to login websites to enter in user identifications and credentials. Upon successful authentication, HTTP cookies are issued and used by web applications to validate authenticated user sessions. Microsoft Passport is an example of Web SSO solutions. 
Operating system integrated sign-on refers to authentication modules and interfaces built into the operating system. The Windows security subsystem provides such capability through system modules such as Local Security Authority (LSA) and Security Specific Providers (SSP) SSPI refers to the programming interfaces into these SSP. Desktop applications that use the SSPI APIs for user authentication can then 'piggyback' on Windows desktop login to help achieve application SSO. GSSAPI on various UNIX implementations also provide the same application SSO functionality.
Federated sign-on requires the application authentication infrastructures to understand trust relationships and interoperate through standard protocols. Kerberos and the future Active Directory Federation Service are examples of federation technologies. Federated sign-on means that the authentication responsibility is delegated to a trusted party. Application users need not be prompted to sign-on again as long as the user has been authenticated by a federated (i.e. trusted) authentication infrastructure component.
Identity and credential mapping solutions typically use credential caches to keep track of the identities and credentials to use for accessing a corresponding lists of application sites. The cache may be updated manually or automatically when the credential (for example password) changes. Existing applications may or may not need to be modified to use identity-mapping solutions. When the application cannot be modified, a software agent may be installed to monitor application login events. When the agent detects such events, it finds the user credential in the cache and automatically inputs the credential into the application login prompt.
The password synchronization technique is used to synchronize passwords at the application credential databases so that users and applications do not have to manage multiple passwords changes. Password synchronization as a silo-ed technology does not really provide single sign-on, but results in some conveniences that applications can take advantage of. For example, with password synchronization, a middle tier application can assume that the password for an application user is the same at the various systems it need access to so that the application does not have to attempt looking up for different passwords to use when accessing resources at those systems.
Entitlement Management
Entitlement management refers to the set of technologies used to grant and revoke access rights and privileges to identities. It is closely associated with authorization, which is the actual process of enforcing the access rules, policies and restrictions that are associated with business functions and data. 
Today's enterprise applications frequently use a combination of rolebased authorization and business rules-based policies to determine what a given identity can or cannot do. 
Within a distributed n-tiered application, access decisions can be made at any layer in the application's architecture. For example, the presentation tier might only present UI choices that the user is authorized to make. At the service layer of the architecture, the service might check that the user meets the authorization condition for invoking the service. For example, only users in the manager role can invoke the 'Loan Approval' service. Behind the scenes at the business logic tier, there might need to be fine grain business policy decisions such as 'Is this request made during business hours'; at the data layer, the database stored procedure might filter returned data based on the relationship between the service invoker's identity and the requested data. 
Given the usefulness, and often intersecting use, of both role and rulebased authorization schemes, it is not always clear to application architects how to model an entitlement management framework that integrates both schemes cleanly. Many enterprises have separate custom engines to do both. 

Figure 6. Integrating role and rule-based authorization illustrates a representation of how both schemes might be combined and integrated. 
In this representation, we can envision a role definition (which typically reflects a job responsibility) with two sets of properties. One set of properties contain the identities of people or systems that are in the given role. For example, Alice, Bob and Charlie may be assigned to the Manager role. The second set of properties contains the set of rights that a given role has. Rights can represent business functions or actions on computing resources. For example, transfer fund defines a business function and read file refers to an operation on a computing resource. Furthermore, we can assign a set of conditional statements (business rules) for each right. For example, the transfer fund right may have a conditional statement to allow the action if the current time is within business hour. Note that the conditional statement might base its decision on dynamic input data that can only be determined at application runtime. 
It is also important for most organizations to have a consolidated view of all the rights that a given identity possesses. To meet this requirement, entitlement management applications typically leverage a centralized policy store to help facilitate centralized management and reporting of users' rights. 
Identity Aggregation
Enterprise IT systems evolve organically over the course of an organization's history. This is often due to reasons such as mergers and acquisitions, or preferences and changes of IT leaderships. The consequences of this are often manifested through hodge-podges of disconnected IT systems with undesirable architectural artifacts. Identity-related systems are no exceptions to such IT evolutions. 
Frequently, the enterprise will have not just one identity systems, but several, each serving different business functions but storing duplicated and related data. Applications that need to integrate with those business functions are then forced to reconcile the differences and synchronize the duplications. 
For example, a banking customer service application might need to obtain customer information from an IBM DB2 database, an Oracle based authorization database and a homegrown CRM. In this case, the application's concept of 'Customer' is defined by three different systems. Attributes that describe customer such as customer name, address, and social security number might be stored and duplicated in multiple systems. On the other hand, non-duplicated data such as the financial products that the customer has purchased and the customer's bank balance might be kept in separate systems. The application will need to aggregate this data from different systems to get the necessary view of the customer.
Moving the underlying identity data into one huge giant identity system might seem like an obvious answer to this problem. However, there are many real world issues (for example, the risk of breaking legacy applications) that prevent such solution from being broadly adopted any time soon. Identity aggregation therefore refers to the set of technologies that help applications aggregate identity information from different identity systems, while reducing the complexity of data reconciliation, synchronization and integration.
There are several technical challenges that identity aggregation technologies should help address:


Maintaining relationships for data transformations.
Optimizing data CRUD operations.
Synchronizing data.

The next few sub-sections provide an overview of these design issues.
(a) Maintaining Relationships for Data Transformations
An identity aggregation solution can provide several benefits to applications with disparate views of identity information that manipulate data in different systems. The first benefit involves providing applications with a consolidated view or an aggregated view of the data in the individual systems. In order to transform and represent data in different views, the identity aggregation solution needs to maintain meta-data describing the schema representing the consolidated view and its relationship with the data schema in the various identity systems.
Let's look at a specific example of an identity life cycle management application that is managing data across a few existing systems. The consolidated view of the management application is represented by a new schema which is made up of new and existing identity attributes.

Figure 7. Reconciling identity schemas 
Figure 7 illustrates an example where a new identity schema is defined for the application. The new schema refers to attributes in two existing identity schemas and also defined new ones that are not currently specified (Account Number, Cell phone and Preferences).
In order for applications to query and update data in existing stores, we will need to maintain data relationships between the attributes defined in the new schema and the corresponding attributes in the existing schemas. For example, the following relationships will need to be maintained:


Reference   A reference refers to a piece of information that unambiguously identifies an instance of data as represented by a particular data schema. For example, the 'Customer ID' attribute allows a data instance as represented by the application scheme in Figure 7 to find its corresponding data instance as represented by existing schema 1. Different schemas may use different references to identify their own data instances.
Ownership   A data attribute may be defined in more than one existing schema. Using the same example shown in Figure 7 again, we can see that the 'Name' and 'Address' attributes are defined in both existing schemas. In the event of a data conflict, the application needs to know which version holds the authoritative copy to keep. In addition, there may be scenarios where an attribute can get its value from a prioritized list of owners. In those scenarios, when the value for an attribute is not present in the first authoritative source, the aggregation service should query the next system in the prioritized list of owners.
Attribute Mapping   Attributes defined in multiple data store may have the same semantic meaning, but have the same or different syntactic representations. When querying or updating a data attribute, the identity aggregation service needs to know the attributes that are semantically equivalent to one another. For example, although customer id is defined in all three schemas, it is named differently as CustID in identity schema 2. When the application performs an update for an identity's customer id number, the system must also know to update the CustID attribute for the data instance represented by schema 2.

(b) Optimizing Data CRUD Operation
As previously identified, CRUD is a database acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. CRUD defines the basic primitive operations for manipulating data. The reason why CRUD is raised as a technical challenge is because the performance for completing an aggregation-related activity that involves CRUD operations across multiple data backend systems can vary significantly depending on the data relationships.  
In the best-case scenario, CRUD operations can be parallelized. This is mostly true in situations where the data instances can be resolved using the same reference and the data reference always resolves to a unique instance. For example, if the social security number is the only key used for querying and aggregating data across data stores, that particular query can be issued in parallel. 
In the worst-case scenario, the CRUD operations are serialized across data stores. Serialized operation is common in situations where the references used for resolving data instances have dependencies on other data instances. As a simple illustration, let's suppose we need to aggregate data from the HR and Benefits databases and the instance references are employee ID and social security ID respectively. If the only initial key we have for the query is the employee ID, and the social security ID can only be obtained from the HR database, then we will need to serialize the query in the following order:


Query the HR database using the employee ID as the key.
Extract the social security number from the above query results.
Query the benefits database.
Aggregate the query results.

Replication is a common technique used to address performance degradation due to CRUD operations across data stores. To address the performance issue, a portion of the backend data attributes may be replicated to a store maintained by the identity aggregation service. In addition, the local copy of the replicated data can be further de-normalized to help improve the CRUD performance. 
(c) Synchronizing Data
Data synchronization is needed in situations when one or both of the following conditions are true:


Duplicate identity attributes exist in multiple backend stores.
Data is replicated to an intermediate identity aggregator store.

However, the use of data synchronization may also introduce other design issues:


Data conflict resolution. In situations where the data can be updated from more than one source, it is often easy to introduce conflicting data. Some common practices to help mitigate the situations are as follows:

Assign data ownership priority so that in the event of conflict, we will use the assigned authority.
In a conflict, the last writer wins.
Synchronization triggers. A couple of common approaches are scheduled updates and event notification based.



Trust and Federation
As mentioned in the single sign-on section, federation offers a form of single sign-on solution. However, federation is more than just single sign-on. Federation implies delegation of responsibilities honored through trust relationships between federated parties. Authentication is just one form of delegated responsibility. Authorization, profile management, pseudonym services, and billing are other forms of identity-related functions that may be delegated to trusted parties. 
There are three technology elements that are crucial to the concept of federation:


A federation protocol that enables parties to communicate.
A flexible trust infrastructure that supports a variety of trust models.
An extensible policy management framework that supports differing governance requirements.

Federation protocols are the 'languages' that are used by federating parties to communicate with each other. Since federation implies that a responsibility is delegated to and performed by a different party, the protocol must allow individuals to obtain 'capabilities'—essentially tamper-proof claims that a given identity has successfully completed an action or is entitled to a collection of privileges. For example, in the case of federated sign-on, an authenticated identity obtains a capability that proves that the individual has successfully authenticated with an approved authentication service. 
In a complex business world, it is possible to have relatively complex trust schemes involving multiple business parties. Federation technology must be able to capture the essence of those real world trust relationships into simple to understand but powerful trust models that will help enable various business scenarios. Some common trust models, illustrated in Figure 8, are as follows:


Hub-and-spoke
Hierarchical
Peer-to-peer Web of Trust


Figure 8. Common trust models
The hub-and-spoke model is the simplest to understand. In this model, there is a central broker that is directly trusted by the federating parties. The European Union is an example of this federation model where the EU countries directly trust the EU body to provide common economic guidelines and trade opportunities to federated parties. 
In the hierarchical model, two parties have an indirect trust relationship if they both have a trust path in their respective branches in the hierarchical tree to a common root authority. The American political system demonstrates this trust model. This political system has federal, state, county and local city political bodies, each existing at various levels of the hierarchy. 
The peer-to-peer model represents a collection of ad-hoc direct trust relationships. Personal relationships between friends in the physical world are good examples of this trust model. Note that it is also possible to extend and form new networks of federations that consist of different trust models, or hybrid models.
A basic policy management framework must allow policies to be created, deleted, modified and discovered. In order to promote federated systems that enable new business models and partnerships to be quickly integrated, the policy management framework must also be extensible to reflect the dynamicity of the environment it aims to support. 
Some examples of application policies that are relevant in the federated world are:


Trusted issuer of identity-related capabilities.
The types of capabilities required to invoke an application's operation.
The kinds of identity information that the application expects in capabilities. 
The kinds of privileges that an identity must demonstrate in order to invoke a service.

Auditing
Auditing in the context of I&AM, is about keeping records of 'who did what, when' within the IT infrastructure. Federal regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are key drivers of the identity-related auditing requirements.
(a) IT Audit Process
The IT audit process typically involves the following phases as illustrated in Figure 9:


Audit generation
Data collection and storage
Analysis and feedback


Figure 9. IT audit process
Audit trails can be generated by different infrastructure and application components for different purposes. For example, firewalls and VPN servers can generate events to help detect external intrusions; middleware components can generate instrumentation data to help detect performance anomalies; and business applications can produce audit data to aid debugging or comply with regulatory audit requirements. 
After the audit data has been produced, it needs to be collected and stored. There are two main models to consider here: distributed and centralized. In the distributed model, audit data typically remains in the system where the data is generated. With the centralized approach, data is sent to a central collection and data storage facility. 
Once the data is collected, they may be processed and analyzed automatically or manually. The audit analysis is designed to lead to conclusions on what corrective actions, if any, are needed to improve the IT systems and processes. 
(b) Audit Systems Design Considerations
Given the typical auditing process described in the previous sections, there are several considerations that are important to the design of auditing systems:


Locality of audit generation and storage.
Separation of auditor's role.
Flow of audited events.

Once an audit trail is generated, the audit data can be stored locally on the same system or transferred to another storage location. This consideration is important from a security perspective, as audit data can be easier to change and modify if it is stored on the same system that generates it. This point can be illustrated by a simple example: in the event that a system has been compromised, the attacker might be able to modify the audit trail on the local system to cover up the hacking attempt. Therefore, for higher assurance against such attacks, you might want the audit system to store the data separately on a remote machine. 
Role separation is a common best practice to help minimize the occurrence of illegal activities resulting from actions that might circumvent accountability checks. For example, a corporate acquisition officer should not be able to approve purchasing requests. In the field of IT audit, it is common practice to separate the system administrator role from the auditor's role. Doing so prevents the system administrator who usually has 'god status' on computers to cover up audit trails of unauthorized activities. 
In a distributed design model, where audit data is generated and stored in different systems, only allowing data to flow out of the audit generation systems can add another level of safeguard. This preventive measure reduces the chances of tampered audit data replacing actual trails. 
In addition, identity auditing infrastructures are also expected to be:


Efficient (typically means a message-based asynchronous communication channel).
Available (typically means distributed, clustered and fault tolerant).
Accurate (keep accurate records and traces).
Non-repudiated (can be admitted into the courts of law as evidence, typically means the records need to be digitally signed).

Conclusions
Organizations are made up of people and systems, represented within the IT systems as digital identities. Everything that occurs in businesses is the consequence of actions initiated by and for those identities. Without identities (even anonymous identities) there would be no activities and businesses would be lifeless constructs. 
At the highest level, SOA can be seen as a way to organize the business IT infrastructure that executes and manages business activities. Therefore, enterprises seeking to realize SOA must figure out how to resolve the identity and access management challenges they face today. We have provided an overview on a few keys technology areas:


Achieving user and application single sign-on.
Aggregating, transforming, synchronizing, and provisioning identity data from various identity systems.
Managing access to business functions and data using roles and rules.
Federating with business partners.
Auditing identity-related activities.

We also hope that the technical discussions on challenges have helped the readers gain some appreciation of the products and solutions in this space.
Our final conclusion is: Identity and access management is a cornerstone to realizing SOA. Show me an enterprise that claims to be "SOAccessful" and I'll show you an enterprise that has good handle on its identity and access management.

 The rise of network-based, automated services in the past decade has definitely changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.Fortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as "identity management architecture" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.Author Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.How does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.

Durbhaon January 6, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThough this book covers some basic issues surrounding identity management, the architecture part is very weak. What I felt is that the author is confusing delivery management with the technology itself. Major sections of the book (under the guise of governance) are devoted to people and expectation management and politics rather than technology. Majority of what is discussed is applicable universally to execution of any project in any decent sized organization. Not that this books has nothing to offer on IMA itself - but it is too generic and very little on actual technology.Read more0Comment|

The book, written around 2003 is a bit outdated in some points, but this is not too much of an issue given its focus: governance, broad principles of identity management, high level theoretical guidelines of architecture. Sure, it is a good refresh of the high level governance principles that should guide identity management projects from a managerial perspective.But the book clearly lacks substance when it comes to the practical implementation. While it is of some help during the planning phase of IM projects, it essentially stops where one wants to start. Conceptual approach, theoretical design, planning are one thing. Implementing is another, totally absent here. The book will not help in areas like dimensioning, practical issues and pitfalls, product evaluation, actual design and architecture, ROI, cost vs benefit and such. It is totally lacking any How To?The book starts the traditional way: explaining what digital identity is. This is followed by about 8 chapters about the constituents of identity management, including authentication, trust, integrity, non-repudiation, and even digital rights management. Except for a very brief refresher, I think these have no place here and they should have been summarized in one single chapter. Other books treat this much better, and many readers will find this part to be a somewhat boring given it is background knowledge for any CISSP-level security person. The DRM chapter (Chapter 10), and some other parts in this area are even irrelevant, in my view.This first part is followed by two chapters on (11) Interoperability Standards and (12) Federating Identity. Here again, the Interoperability Standards goes into unneeded technical details and misses the point. It is not giving the reader an understanding of the real issues: interoperability for what purpose? What are the issues? How can we go about them?On the other hand, the Federating Identity chapter should probably be substantially expanded, as it is the meat of what identity management is about today. Three or four chapters should probably be devoted to this, and they should include practical examples of scenarios, architectures. It should be shown why identity federation is key, but again, the chapter does not go beyond very high-level and theoretical principles.Finally, the book concludes with about eight chapters on architecture, governance, policies and such. While these give an idea of what is required in a well governed enterprise with an advanced maturity model, once again, these chapters lack real practical usability. In addition, this part is really not specific to identity management, but is rather a short summary of what has to be done in terms of governance, enterprise and reference architectures, and policy management.Having read the book, I'm kind of disappointed. Facing a real project on identity management, the reader will surely think. Good, and now, what do we do? Possibly, it may make happy the high-level manager only seeking to understand what identity management is about, with no intention to get involved in the project.This other reader, Prasad Reddy, summarizes it very well: "The book absolutely fails and falls short on explaining the identity management standards and technologies related to single sign-on, federation, provisioning and assurance. From a real-world IDMS deployment perspective the book is truly misleading !". Why so many gave it 4 or 5 stars is unclear. I'd hesitate between 2 and 3.Useless, no, but I will still have to look out for something more useable in real life.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood introduction to IMAByBen Rothkeon November 15, 2005Format: PaperbackMany people who review their credit report for the first time are shocked to learn how many identities are linked to them. Even when there is no problem of identity theft, it is not uncommon for people to have 10 or more names linked to their credit reports due to various errors, including permutation of their name.Just as it is difficult to maintain and manage identities in the real world, it is difficult to maintain and manage digital identities. As the digital economy is becoming more ubiquitous, the need for a single federated identity is becoming more critical. In Digital Identity, Phillip Windley details the steps needed to develop an identity management architecture (IMA).Identity management has become a pressing need in the past few years. This has come about because networks and systems are no longer geared around a single infrastructure, and businesses have become increasingly virtual and decentralized. In previous years, there were simply internal users. Today, systems have internal users, along with external users such as consultants, contractors, third-parties, customers, collaborators, and many more. Such requirements necessitate a well-designed and planned IMA.So what is this thing called IMA? Windley defines an IMA as the coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications, and management activities that enable an organization to effectively manage digital identities.IMA is also known as federated identity. The book notes that the real challenge in developing a federated identity infrastructure is dealing with the various different hardware and software platforms where user accounts reside, and working with different organizations and departments, including the ever-increasing amount of outsourcing. When all of that is put together, a single federated identity is not easy to come by if there is not an IMA in place.The beauty of an IMA is that it allows an organization to securely link and exchange identity information across partner, supplier, and customer organizations, while having a single architecture. This makes identity management seamless.The first 11 chapters of Digital Identity do a good job of introducing the underlying concepts of an IMA, including security, trust, authentication, access control, and names and directories. Without an effective security infrastructure in place, any IMA deployed will not be fully effective.One oddity, though, is that in Chapter 6, the author defines cryptography as the science of making the cost of discovery of hidden information greater than the value of the information itself. This is the author's own characterization of cryptography and while interesting, is not how it is used in mainstream security.Chapter 12 starts to get into the internals of federated identities. This and the rest of the chapters do not deal with the deep technical details of an IMA, rather it shows how to design and deploy the IMA in a context of a corporate environment under a single set of policies and procedures. Windley emphasizes that an IMA is not so much a technical issue, but rather a business issue that must be deployed in a business context.This idea of a business context is manifest in Chapter 18, which deals with identity policies. The book creates what it calls an IMA policy stack, which is the interoperability framework for the IMA. The stack includes all of the elements necessary for the IMA, and comprises an identity management architecture, framework, and set of standards. The standards include all protocols and applications, from SSL, XML, LDAP, DNS, and much more. The framework includes policy issues such as naming, passwords, encryption, provisioning, and more. Finally, the architecture details the specific high-level controls (procurement, contracts, licensing, etc.) around the IMA.The book itself is worth it solely for the information in this chapter. Anyone attempting to deploy an IMA without first getting a handle on the issues details in Chapter 18 will find that their IMA will likely be seriously deficient.The only negatives to the book are a few too many editing mistakes that should have been caught during the editing process. Also, the author frequently discusses his own trials and tribulations of using an IMA during his short stint as CIO of the State of Utah and with previous employers. Depending on the readers' specific tastes, some my find the heavy use of the first-person anecdotes to be a negative.Overall, Digital Identity provides the reader with a good introduction to the various areas necessary to develop a productive identity management infrastructure. Anyone planning to deploy an IMA or any sort of federated identity solution in a corporate environment will find Digital Identity a valuable reference.Read more0Comment|

I often go in search of interesting new people to follow, especially in digital marketing. I spend at least an hour every day reading and engaging communities--I consider it part of my lifelong education.
Relevance is important and so is overall reach, so one of the metrics I use as my yard stick for top digital marketing experts is Retweets, as measured by awesome influencer and content discovery tool BuzzSumo.
 
However, my completely unscientific method also includes checking out influencers on specific hashtags using TweetReach (which shows you how far tweets and topics travel), and even going back through the list of people I've followed lately to get to know them better. After all, if they said something to pique my interest in the first place, this could be someone worth connecting with on LinkedIn, as well.
It also matters to me a great deal that people are engaging and not just autotweeting out a feed of stuff. I mean, we follow publications and expect that, but it's nice to see industry experts and thought leaders participating in conversations, too.
Here are my top digital marketing experts to follow on Twitter--people whose expertise and advice I enjoy, and think you will, too.
1. John Shahidi--CEO, Shots
John shares a ton of interesting interviews, blog posts, and relevant news articles with his 354,000 followers and gets an astonishing average of 3,800 retweets. He's just started publishing on Medium and is sure to have plenty of interesting content to share in the future.
2. Donald Miller--Founder, StoryBrand
Donald shares a lot of marketing advice with his 219,000 followers, but also tweets inspirational content for entrepreneurs and business people. While his company, StoryBrand, helps businesses, Don just wrote ScaryClose, a book on relationships that's climbing the bestseller list.
3. Rand Fishkin--Wizard of Moz
Rand has built an impressive following of over 228,000 people in his lengthy online marketing career. He has a super engaged audience who retweet 66 percent of his tweets thanks to the superior depth of his knowledge and his generosity in giving it away.
4. Mike Street--podcaster, SmartBrownVoices
Mr. Mike Street has over 49,000 followers and releases a new digital marketing podcast called Smart Brown Voices for them each week. Almost half of his tweets get retweeted, thanks to the awesome quality of the content he produces and shares.
5. Tabitha Naylor--Sales and marketing pro
Tabitha is a pro at curating interesting, timely, and relevant content for sales and marketing people. She shares tweets from around the web with her 37,400 followers and regularly engages in conversation with her audience.
6. Jay Baer--Business strategist, keynote speaker, and bestselling author
Jay's kind of a big deal--a prolific blogger, he's amassed 150,000 Twitter followers who hang on his every piece of marketing advice. Still, he's down to earth and a great conversationalist. In fact, 43 percent of his tweets actually get replies, indicating a super-high level of relevance and engagement.
7. Ann Handley--Author, marketer, chief content officer, MarketingProfs
Ann is a pioneer in the content marketing industry and is always generous with her time and advice. Her almost 12,000 followers enjoy the quality content she shares from MarketingProfs, industry events, and around the world. Her feed is a treasure trove of knowledge for marketers.
8. Matt Heinz--Founder and president, Heinz Marketing
Matt has diverse interests within the digital marketing spectrum, which makes for an interesting read for his over 56,000 followers. Tune in for a variety of information and insights about content marketing, leadership, marketing strategy, and demand generation.
9. Avinash Kaushik--Digital marketing evangelist, Googler, author
Follow Avinash for a peek inside the brain of the man who serves as digital marketing evangelist for Google and wrote both Web Analytics 2.0 and Web Analytics: An Hour A Day. His 152,000 followers retweet his tweets an average of 13 times each and hang on his every word for the next forward-looking marketing gem.
10. Shelly Kramer--Marketing and brand strategist
Shelly, from v3 Integrated Marketing, has a highly engaged audience of 77,700 followers who reshare 32 percent of her tweets. She tweets several times daily on social media marketing, content, and branding.
11. Mark Schaefer--Author and consultant, Schaefer Marketing Solutions
Mark shares a ton of great info from popular industry publications with his 104,000 followers, but also a great deal from smaller sources you might not have discovered.
12. Jeff Bullas--Chief evangelist, ShuttleRock
As a Forbes Top 50 Social Media Influencer, Jeff is a must-follow for anyone in the digital marketing realm, but especially in social media marketing. He has over 301,000 followers and averages six retweets per tweet.
13. Amber Naslund--SVP marketing, Sysomos
You might remember Amber from her time with Radian6, or her blog, Brass Tack Thinking. Now with social analytics and intelligence platform Sysomos, she still shares her marketing advice and tons of personality on her Twitter with over 55,000 followers.
14. Danny Sullivan--Founding editor, Search Engine Land, Marketing Land
Danny is fast closing in on half a million followers, and it's no wonder; he's been an industry leader in search as long as search has been a thing. He's usually the first out with news about Google, Bing, or other search engines and is generous with the knowledge he's willing to share with others.
15. Dharmesh Shah--Founder/CTO, HubSpot
Dharmesh's 254,000 followers are regularly treated to an experienced insider's point of view on all things marketing, but also startups, entrepreneurism, and funding. A renowned expert and leader in inbound marketing, he's also an angel investor in over 40 startups.
16. Brett Tabke--founder, PubCon and WebmasterWorld
Brett built two incredibly successful digital marketing resources from the ground up and regularly shares his unique perspective with his 38,000 followers. His PubCon is indisputably the most popular online marketing conference in the states, while WebmasterWorld was for years THE place to be to learn about SEO.
17. Duane Forrester--Bing Webmaster Tools
Duane returned to Bing and the entire community rejoiced! A popular fixture at digital marketing conferences and online, he's a smart, insightful guy with 11,000 followers on Twitter. Moreover though, he's generous with his advice and just a nice person all around.
18. Greg Gifford--AutoRevo
Why doesn't this guy have 100,000 Twitter followers? I have no idea, but this is why follower count alone is a poor indicator of quality. I've been super impressed with Greg's digital marketing tips in his video blogs and at conferences. Also, he tweets about bacon. What's not to love?
19. Joe Pulizzi--Z Squared Media
Joe is the brains behind a series of super successful marketing publications and events: Content Marketing Institute, Content Marketing World, and Chief Content Officer. His 68,800 Twitter followers enjoy a first look at emerging trends in content marketing and uber-insightful columns from his publications.
20. Will Critchlow--Distilled
Will has 27,500 followers and is an engaging speaker at conferences like SearchLove. He tweets often techy and super in-depth content about search and mobile. If you want to learn about the inner workings of search in an understandable way, Will's your guy.

One of the most interesting projects that a graphic designer can take on is designing a logo. It can be daunting (and stressful) to come up with logo options based on market research, and stumble upon some "design magic" through the exploratory process. Narrowing it down to a final approved logo and then seeing it out in the world can be a very rewarding experience for a designer.
However, most of the time, a logo is not enough. Large organizations with layers of management require a thorough brand identity system that provides a unified vision and tools that help everyone build the brand. But before we dig in, let's define the difference (and relationship) between a brand, an identity and a logo.
Brand vs. Identity vs. Logo
Pin It
A Brand (or Branding) refers to the perceived image and subsequent emotional response to a company, its products and services. It also represents the conversation that customers are having with each other about the company, and how that spreads. My favorite definition about brand is the one Seth Godin gave: A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it’s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn’t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.An Identity describes the visual devices used to represent the company. Identity systems are a visual components package that is paired with style guidelines and used as a framework to ensure the corporate image is cohesive and consistent. Some of the visual devices that leverage the brand elements and style guidelines are as follows: stationery, marketing collateral, packaging, signage, messaging, and digital projects, among others.A Logo is the central, identifiable visual element that helps customers discover, share and remember a company's brand. Usually it's in the form of an icon (mark or symbol), logotype, or combination of the two. The main purpose of a logo is summed up nicely as the five principles of effective logo design in this Smashing Magazine article.

Phase 1: Research, Vision & Design Brief
Pin It
This phase should be as thorough as needed — depending on the depth of research and size of the company. It's the most crucial part of the overall process, and should result in a design brief that guides the rest of the project.
Below is a list of foundational questions and key dynamics to explore and document through qualitative and quantitative methodologies. (Note: This is only a quick overview of the most complex part of this process.)
How is the brand perceived against competitors in the market for products and services you're looking to provide?What is the positioning statement of your brand? Answer the what, how, to whom, where, why and when questions.What is the heritage of your product type, and the origin(s) of it's ingredients and fabrication process?Who is your audience? Are they digitally savvy? Where will your products/services have contact with them? How do you want that contact experience to make them feel, take action and think about your brand?What values & beliefs should the brand have about the business and it's mission in the world? If the brand was a person, what would it's personality be? How would it look, act and talk?What benefits do you want customers to associate with your brand? What is the vision of the brand that you want to create?Other brand image concerns: market awareness, emotional associations, value to the consumer, brand perception vs. consumer behavior, changes desired in the brand-consumer relationship over time.
As you can tell, it's complicated. Two agencies who I think do a good job with their brand research are Landor and Fi. It shows in the way that they describe their completed work as challenge-and-solution projects.
The Design Brief
It's important to have a design (or creative) brief if the brand identity project is bigger than one designer doing work for a small local business. A design brief should contain summaries from the research phase, such as: target audience(s), messaging objectives, values and mission of the brand, and the brand's products/services offering. It should also include budget, project schedule, file formats for delivery, and other practical needs.
If you're looking for tools and help on how to write a design brief for a brand identity project, explore the following: Freelance Switch Brief Tips, Link List and Logo Design Brief, 99designs, Just Creative, and FreePDF Templates.
Phase 2: Logo, Identity, & Guidelines
Pin It
After the research phase is complete and a design brief has been created, it's time to start designing the logo and identity system.
The Logo
There are many ways to start designing a logo, but most often times you'll see designers begin by sketching out dozens if not hundreds of iterations on paper. The process of getting concepts down on paper and then iterating on those ideas can unlock new directions to explore and final solutions that you wouldn't have normally arrived at when starting on the computer. After selecting your best sketched concepts, you should start iterating on them digitally.
Here's a peak behind the curtain of a few logo concept sketches as they became final digital solutions:
Firefox Logo by Martijn Rijven of Bolt Graphic, art direction by Wolff Olins

ITV logo by Matt Rudd of Rudd Studio

Greenpeace Airplot Logo by Airside
Pin It
The Identity System
The identity system usually starts after the logo is complete. The purpose of the identity system is to form a systematic visual language around the logo — one that compliments the design thinking of the logo and offers a family of useful, flexible elements that will help to design marketing and business collateral. Here are some examples:

Pin It
Handsome Coffee Roasters by Ptarmak
Pin It
Patina Restaurant Group by Mucca Design
Pin It
The Style Guidelines
The style guidelines contain and prescribe the logo usage rules, typeface system, color palette, layout guidelines, and more. They exist so that others can create design collateral and marketing materials that will have a cohesive look and voice.
Style guidelines have traditionally been produced as print and web-ready PDFs. They're the core of the identity design, and usually accompany the logo, templates, fonts and other resources packaged together to make designing for the brand easier. Style guidelines are in-depth rules about logo usage, styling, and layout, and are always interesting to browse through.

Here are a few style guidelines of popular brands: Skype (pdf, brand page), BestBuy (Euro Guidelines), BBC, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Walmart. Looking for more? Dig into this list by Logo Design Love.

These days, the documentation that a designer must deliver has a heavy digital skew, with an emphasis on development-ready files, such as Style Tiles, Element Collages, Style Prototypes, SASS documentation, a Logo/Brand download page, among others.

Phase 3: Monitoring & Rebranding
Lastly, after a new brand identity has launched, it's important to monitor and care for it, as it's a living and breathing thing that interacts with your customers. Honestly, that's a loaded statement as there are many ways to properly care for a brand. Regardless, over time, if your target audience shifts, the market evolves, or the brand's products and services change, it may be time for a rebrand. The main challenge with rebranding is trying to maintain familiarity and consistency so that your customers will remember you.
There are two really awesome sites that give an inside look when prominent brands get rebranded: Rebrand and Under Consideration's Brand New. Here is a quick sampling of their short before and after case studies:

Looooooove this, very well done. Forwarded to a half dozen people (including clients!).

But I gotta pick this nit: in your 2nd bullet under "Brand vs. Identity vs. Logo", I believe you meant "stationery", not "stationary".

Thanks much!

A very concise, and well written explanation. I've been working on a simplified version of this process for some time. I'm constantly distilling it down to just the basics. I find clients love it, but often just skim and rarely get through my longer versions. But, it's missing the details and examples you've captured so well here. http://andyedge.com/identitydesign.html Good read.

Thank you for creating and posting this article! it is very informative and I am glad someone has taken the time to explain the differences between branding, Identity, and logo. I struggled with the separation before taking classes on this subject and I would recommend taking a class to any graphic designer who hasn't.

I only just revealed my portfolio website but there are quite a few nice logo design examples within. Take a look at http://www.Joelkitts.com

Thank you again and I look forward to seeing more articles of this caliber.

Great post. Thanks for sharing the in-depth information about logo designing and branding. The phases and the examples included in it are really amazing. For each phase, a detailed description is given, including the examples of popular brands. It is really interesting to know how thoughtful these designs are !! Really a nice article !
