Playing Games in China
The9 looks to grow in China, but its earnings are going the wrong way.











                Rick Munarriz
            

                (TMFBreakerRick)



            
            Aug 29, 2007 at 12:00AM
            
            





So now we know that The9  (NASDAQ:NCTY) is mortal after all. The Chinese online gaming specialist stumbled in its latest quarter, clocking in well below Wall Street expectations, as a new game wasn't enough to offset service outages of its popular version of Blizzard's  World of Warcraft.
Net revenue inched 5% higher to $35.5 million, but earnings fell 40% to hit $0.25 per share. Analysts were expecting the company to generate a profit of $0.34 a share on $38.7 million in revenue. 
The server downtime was necessary for game upgrades and Wall Street was already braced for a bottom-line dip. However, May's commercialization of  Soul of the Ultimate Nation should have helped a little more than it did.
This is a disappointing quarter for a couple of reasons. Yes, the company missed its top- and bottom-line targets, but the report also comes just one day after rival Shanda  (NASDAQ:SNDA) blew past analyst expectations. 
It's the first time that The9 has missed Wall Street estimates after six straight market-thumping quarters. Finally, this comes during the same quarter in which The9 was going to show us all how it is no longer a one-trick pony. (Last quarter's conference call identified how The9 planned to diversify into a multigame operator.)





Sure, The9 has come a long way since it was little more than a lowly distributor of games in mainland China made by Korea's Webzen  (NASDAQ:WZEN). Now it's right up there with Shanda and NetEase.com  (NASDAQ:NTES) as the three online gaming companies that command a collective 60% stake of the promising Internet video game market in China. The9 closed out the quarter with 22.4 million registered users, with as many as 930,000 of them playing at the same time. 
Despite the lackluster quarterly financials, The9 is encouraged by the initial reaction of consumers to  Soul of the Ultimate Nation. It also has another two games in the pipeline.  
If you believe in the niche, the market's negative reaction to the company's report is a buying opportunity. Too much attention is being given to the government's crackdown on 100,000 Internet cafes and not enough to the improving economy that will make home-based connectivity more common in the years to come. 
If you're going to get excited about more conventional video game publishers closer to home, like Activision  (NASDAQ:ATVI), Take-Two  (NASDAQ:TTWO), and THQ  (NASDAQ:THQI), then betting on the market leaders in China's high-margin niche is more than reasonable. 





Sure, The9 is mortal, but as its product catalog can now tell you, it also has Soul.

China's Bald Tires
Yet another defective product from the Orient piles on the misery of overseas investing.

Not that China needed another black eye these days, but reports that tires manufactured in the country are missing a key safety component that's already caused two deaths certainly doesn't help China shed its growing image of shoddy products.
Some 450,000 Chinese-made tires -- a number that could balloon to nearly a million, depending on how many distributors have sold tires made at this factory -- are going to be subject to a massive recall that threatens to bankrupt the small New Jersey distributor that imports them. Foreign Tire Sales says it will begin a recall when it gets notification from the NHTSA. "We will wait to get their order and create a remedy plan and begin a recall," said a company spokesman. "When the money runs out, that's the end."
The problem is that a thin gum strip between the steel belts of a tire is allegedly missing. Foreign Tire says the Chinese manufacturer, a company that it's been doing business with for 10 years with no problems until now, stopped inserting the $1-a-piece strip, leading to tread separation. It was tread separation that doomed Firestone a few years back and caused a blowout in its relationship with Ford  (NYSE:F), which had extended as far back as the Model T.
The Chinese manufacturer, the Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Company, disputes the assertion, though Foreign Tires says it had admitted as much to the company in a report it gave to federal regulators. Foreign Tire was sued in May as a result of a crash caused by tread separation that led to two deaths. The company had been suspicious of the tires since 2005, when it began receiving an increasing number of customer complaints about them. The company undertook its own tests, and earlier this month it reported its concerns to the NHTSA, asking for assistance in recalling the tires. It estimates that this process will cost between $50 million and $80 million -- money Foreign Tire says it doesn't have.
Hangzhou Zhongce thinks the problem has more to do with China becoming a bigger player in the tire market than anything to do with defective tires. According to the Rubber Manufacturers Association, China accounts for 32 million units in tire imports to the U.S., the largest of any other country. Both Goodyear  (NYSE:GT) and Cooper Tire  (NYSE:CTB) have moved production facilities to China in the face of rising U.S. labor costs.





Tires, of course, are merely the latest in a string of high-profile product problems emanating from China. Toymaker RC2  (NASDAQ:RCRC) is probably relieved that tires may now be the focus of substandard manufacturing processes. Since it was discovered that its hugely popular Thomas the Tank Engine train toys were coated with lead paint -- a process its Chinese manufacturer also undertook on its own -- it has been the subject of consumer and regulatory ire. Lead paint has been banned in the U.S. for decades.
Before the toy problem, there was another cause for alarm: the use of antifreeze in Chinese-made toothpaste (the ingredient was mislabeled as a benign similar-sounding chemical). And then there was tainted pet food that contained a flame retardant as an additive.
Investing overseas can provide wonderful opportunities to profit from emerging markets and growing companies domiciled outside of United States. For my money, however, China has yet to prove itself committed to ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of its products, while the companies themselves walk a knife's edge of legitimacy in a Communist society. This requires us not only to carefully consider whether we want to invest in a company like game maker The9  (NASDAQ:NCTY), but also whether a company like Goodyear continues to warrant our investment dollars too.
