      Course Description
    
Purpose of CourseMarketing is an understanding of how to communicate with the consumer.  It includes four activities:Creating products and services that serve consumers;Communicating a clear value proposition;Delivering products and services in a way that optimizes value;Exchanging, or trading, value for those offerings.Many people incorrectly believe that marketing and advertising are the same thing.  In reality, advertising is but one of the many tools used in marketing, which is the process by which firms determine which products to offer, how to price those products, and to whom the products should be made available.In this course, you will learn about the marketing process and examine the range of marketing decisions that an organization must make in order to sell its products and services.You will also learn how to think like a marketer, discovering that the focus of marketing has always been on the customer.  You will begin to intuitively ask: what does the customer need?  What does the customer want?  Who is this customer?We will also explore the various ways in which marketing departments and independent agencies answer these questions – whether through research, analysis, or even trial-and-error.  Once a company identifies its customer and product, marketers must then determine the best way to capture the customer’s attention.  Capturing the customer’s attention may entail undercutting competitors on price, aggressively marketing a product with promotions and advertising (as with “As Seen On TV” ads), or specifically targeting ideal customers (as with custom yacht building).  The strategy a marketing firm chooses for a particular product is absolutely vital to the success of the product.  The idea that “great products sell themselves” is simply not true.  By the end of this course, you will be familiar with the art and science of marketing a product.

Enhancing brand value. Enriching client equity.


We are one of India's leading independent full service advertising agencies with wide capabilities
                                                      and a substantial reputation built over more than four decades. We provide advertising, design, 
                                                      media planning and buying, market research, digital and public relations services to hundreds of clients.





We believe that creativity for its own sake is fool's gold; it must be founded on sound overall strategy. 
                                                      If there's anything that distinguishes our style, its our stress on hard facts, simplicity and relevance. 
                                                      That's why we're unfailingly successful in our work.





We consider every angle before making recommendations, while keeping an eye on the budget.
                                                      Effective ideas needn't cost a fortune, as we have demonstrated time and again.





At Pressman, we don't just rely on conventional wisdom. We listen. We take time to understand the
                                                      clients' business and goals. And then we deliver in the most effective way using our wealth of
                                                      specialist knowledge and experience.





Our work is characterized by a determination to achieve excellence in our mission: creating competitive advantages for our clients, enhancing brand values and enriching client equity.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/30/2005
            

                BBB has determined that Saylor Fence, Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)

7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
