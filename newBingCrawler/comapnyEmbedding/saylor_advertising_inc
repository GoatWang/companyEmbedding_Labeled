We are one of India's leading independent full service advertising agencies with wide capabilities
                                                      and a substantial reputation built over more than four decades. We provide advertising, design,

We believe that creativity for its own sake is fool's gold; it must be founded on sound overall strategy. 
                                                      If there's anything that distinguishes our style, its our stress on hard facts, simplicity and relevance. 
                                                      That's why we're unfailingly successful in our work.





We consider every angle before making recommendations, while keeping an eye on the budget.
                                                      Effective ideas needn't cost a fortune, as we have demonstrated time and again.





At Pressman, we don't just rely on conventional wisdom. We listen. We take time to understand the
                                                      clients' business and goals. And then we deliver in the most effective way using our wealth of
                                                      specialist knowledge and experience.

Point-of-Sale Marketing
Explore the Strategy of Point-of-Sale Marketing

You’re waiting in line at the supermarket—and, as you’re not particularly interested in staring at the back of the customer in front of you, you glance around the line. 
The display of candy bars within immediate reach reminds you that you’re a little hungry, so you grab one (it’s on sale). Oh, and that magazine looks interesting. You’re already reading an article when you get to the cash register, where the teller asks if you want to donate $1 to a charity; and doing so, you write your name on a little heart placard that gets placed on the wall with a hundred other hearts from other donators. Finally, you complete your purchase(s) and get your receipt—with several extra items you hadn't expected to buy.

What is point of sale marketing?
Point of sale marketing refers to all  efforts that increase sales at the point the purchase is actually made. Primarily this revolves around a cash register (although a point of purchase for a business might be a meeting table, or an Internet page), and is a staple of retail and restaurant environments. 

The most common method of point of sale marketing is the merchandise display, while other methods include the use of signage, receipts, and suggestive selling by the retailer at the POS. (See also Shopper Marketing)





Who employs point-of-sale marketing?
Restaurants and retailers frequently use point of sale marketing tactics to encourage customers to make last-minute purchases. However, because retailers resell other business’ products, point of sale marketing is significant to every company that sells items located at/near a retailer’s POS.
Grocery stores commonly place merchandise shelving in between each available register, featuring items such as magazines, candy, gum, and batteries. Sodas are often displayed in a small refrigeration unit at the end of these displays. Items near the POS frequently move at one-and-a-half to three times as fast as the same product on a shelf elsewhere in the store, and some items in high-traffic supermarkets have been reported to sell as much as 64 times faster.
Gas stations similarly line products at their register counter. Here, energy vitamins and beef jerky are items added to those also commonly sold at grocery store registers.
Fast-food restaurants commonly display desserts and gift cards at their POS. Dine-in restaurants in which customers pay at the counter instead of through their server (such as Denny’s and Sizzler) may also feature items here.
Retail businesses, including hardware stores, auto parts stores, hobby stores, and others place their own low-ticket items around their checkout locations.
Tobacco companies focus much of their advertising around the point of sale; although their displays and advertisements are subject to more legal regulations than other products.
Brands can purchase display space at a retailer’s POS, or even use the POS system software to promote their product. For example, Hellman’s designed a program that printed recipes featuring Hellman’s mayonnaise (and other products purchased at the same time) on customers’ receipts, which led to an increase in sales as customers put their mayonnaise to further use.
Starbucks is a particularly good example of POS marketing, insofar as they have low-ticket merchandise on display there, a POS software that facilitates suggestive selling, and a receipt program that encourages repeat business.
Non-profit organizations and causes can sell paper plaques (also called pinups, icons, or mobiles) at the point of sale, which visually represent a donation made, and offer the customer a social reward for donating (such as putting the donator’s name on display).

For what kinds of customers is point of sale marketing effective?
Capturing Customer Interest at the POS

Low-ticket items
Novelty and gift items
Sale items (the promoted items can even be perpetually “on sale”)
Eye level is “buy level”
Point of sale merchandise tends to focus on low-ticket impulse items which can easily be added to other purchases. They appeal most to impulse customers who aren’t particularly loyal to a brand (brand shoppers will typically find their preferred brand on its normal shelf, instead of discovering it at the POS). 
While different types of retailers may have very different customer bases, POS displays tend to have a universal appeal. Despite representing an unplanned buy, POS items are particularly attractive to price-sensitive customers, as they’re commonly displayed as “deal” items, whether that means being on sale, or “new in store,” or an “item of the week.” (See also Promotional Marketing)

How is a point of sale marketing campaign developed?
Retailers have many options available to them in point of sale marketing, so first they need to identify what goals they wish to accomplish. Do they want to move overstocked items, increase  visibility of new items,  highlight a particular product line, or serve seasonal interests?
Types of POS Displays
counter displays—typically small, as they must never block line-of-sight between the clerk and the customer
floor displays (“dumps”)—commonly constructed from card stock
shelf talkers—small signage that appears next to the product on the shelf
posters—when wall space is present
video and digital signage—suspended above customers in line
Next, they must consider the physical layout of their stores, including the customers’ paths to the POS. Supermarkets  tend to have one line per register, while other retailers, such as Best Buy or Barnes and Noble, commonly use one line for several registers. This allows businesses to  display different merchandise all along the lines, attracting consumers looking for distractions while waiting in line.
Product manufacturers must also consider spatial restrictions when designing POS displays, often sending agents to visit various stores to recommend variations in a displays. 
These agents will also negotiate with retailers for display space—a scarce resource, as there are far more products available for display than space allows. This negotiation may take place with individual store owners, or with corporate offices which control many stores. 
Fast-food restaurants and other businesses in which customers’ purchase decisions are made at the POS may establish policies and training that promotes suggestive selling, in which the clerk recommends additional items for purchase. Additionally, they may purchase POS software that incorporates this directly into the purchase: for example, by providing scripted lines to the clerk based upon what items have been rung up.

How can a marketing school help you in this field?
Point of sale marketing requires not only the ability to promote a product to customers, but also to make a compelling value proposition to retailers. A marketing program equips you with both the promotional and business skills you need to design effective point of sale marketing campaigns.                                            
In a marketing program, you’ll not only develop your speaking and presentation skills, but also your ability to communicate through non-verbal means, including graphics and product displays. You’ll also learn how to tailor your communication to your audience, whether it’s the end consumer or another business retailing your company’s product. Meanwhile, classes in market research and consumer psychology will further increase your ability to understand consumer shopping behavior, and develop value propositions appealing to them and the retailers who serve them.
To learn more about how a marketing program can help you, request information from schools with degrees in marketing, and take the first steps toward an engaging marketing career.
