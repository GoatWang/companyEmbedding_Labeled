Oil & Gas


Failures to oil and gas pipelines can have severe environmental consequences and cost billions of dollars to rectify. Because of this, safety regulations governing these pipelines are becoming more stringent and visible.








Because of growing oil and gas pipeline regulations, operators are implementing thorough integrity programs that ensure leaks and failures do not occur.


Integrity programs that combine structural condition assessment with regular and accurate verification of containment surveys significantly reduce the risk of failure while extending the useful life of thepipeline asset.


By utilizing verification from containment tools that identify very small losses, oil and gas pipeline operators can identify and repair problems at an early stage in their development. This is important as small pipeline leaks can eventually lead to failure.


Through a diverse and comprehensive integrity program, oil and gas operators can reduce the risk of pipe failure. Click the links below to learn more about Pure’s oil and gas solution and how it fits into a complete pipeline integrity program.

Tech Paper: Development of a Long Duration, Free Swimming, Inline Acoustic Leak Detection Inspection Tool


Acoustic leak detection inspection tools have become a common technique to identify minute pipeline leakage before the leak and the defect producing it can become a larger problem or even a rupture level event. While these inspection tools only identify small defects once they reach the through wall stage and result in leakage, they can be an effective means of demonstrating the pressure tightness of a pipeline and ruling out the presence of through wall defects that are below the detection threshold of other ILI inspection tools; in so doing finding a way into both the leak detection and pipeline integrity toolboxes.
