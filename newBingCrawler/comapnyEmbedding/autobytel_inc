The Company operates through providing automotive marketing services segment. The Company's consumer-facing automotive Websites, which include its Website Autobytel.com, provide consumers with information and tools to aid them with the automotive purchase decisions and the ability to submit inquiries requesting dealers to contact the consumers regarding purchasing or leasing vehicles. Its AutoWeb pay-per-click advertising marketplace program uses technology to refer in-market consumer traffic to dealers and manufacturer Websites. For consumers not be able to secure loans through conventional lending sources, the Websites provide these consumers the ability to submit inquiries requesting dealers or other lenders that may offer vehicle financing to these consumers to contact the consumers regarding vehicle financing.Leads are internally-generated from its Websites (Internally-Generated Leads) or acquired from third parties (Non-Internally-Generated Leads) that generate Leads from their Websites (Non-Company Websites). The Company sells Internally-Generated Leads and Non-Internally-Generated Leads directly to Dealers and indirectly to dealers through a wholesale market consisting of manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive Lead distribution industry. In conjunction with its Lead programs, the Company also offers dealers and manufacturers other products and services, including the iControl by Autobytel, WebLeads+, Email Marketing Manager, Payment Pro, and Lead Call products and services, to assist them in capturing online, in-market customers and selling more vehicles by improving conversion of Leads to sale transactions.Vehicle Lead ProgramsThe Company provides dealers and manufacturers with opportunities to market their vehicles to vehicle buyers. Dealers participate in its Vehicle Lead programs, and manufacturers participate in the Vehicle Lead programs, the display advertising programs and the direct marketing programs, reaching consumers that are in the market to acquire a vehicle. For consumers using its Websites, the Company provides research information, including vehicle specification data, safety data, pricing data, photos, videos, regional rebate and incentive data, and additional tools, such as the compare and configuration tools. The Company also provides additional content on its Websites, including the database of articles, such as consumer and professional reviews, and other analyses. Additional automotive information is also available on its Websites to assist consumers with specific vehicle research, such as the trade-in value of their current vehicle.The Company's Vehicle Lead program for vehicles allows consumers to submit requests for pricing and availability of specific makes and models. A Vehicle Lead provides information regarding the make and model of a vehicle, and may also include additional data regarding the consumer's needs, including any vehicle trade-in, whether the consumer wishes to lease or buy, and other options for the vehicle acquisition decision. The Company's used Vehicle Lead program allows consumers to search for used vehicles according to specific search parameters, such as the price, make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. The consumer is able to locate and display the description, price and, if available, digital images of vehicles that satisfy the consumer's search parameters. The consumer can then submit a Lead for additional information regarding a specific vehicle that it delivers to the dealer offering the vehicle. In addition to sending Leads directly to dealers through the Lead delivery system, consumers may choose to contact the dealer using a number posted next to the vehicle search results.Finance Lead ProgramThe Company's Finance Lead program provides consumers who may not be able to secure loans through conventional lending sources the opportunity to obtain vehicle financing and other services from dealers or financial institutions offering vehicle financing to these consumers. Consumers can submit a request for vehicle financing or submit a credit questionnaire for a credit report or other credit services that are provided by third party providers. The Company has a call center program that consists of telephone surveys of Finance Lead consumers. In addition, the Company inquires about the consumer's interest in obtaining information or quotes for relevant products and services, including credit report repair and vehicle loan refinancing, offered by third parties.Other Dealer Products and ServicesIn conjunction with the automotive Vehicle Lead programs, the Company also offers products and services that assist dealers in connecting with in-market consumers and closing vehicle sales, including iControl by Autobytel, WebLeads+, Email Manager and Lead Call, Payment Pro, Mobile Products and Services, and SaleMove Products and Services. iControl by Autobytel is its technology that allows dealers many options to filter and control the volume and source of their Vehicle Leads. iControl by Autobytel can be controlled at the dealership or at the dealer group level from a Web-based console. From the console, dealerships can contract or expand territories and increase, restrict or block specific models and Lead Web sources.WebLeads+ offers a dealer multiple coupon options that display relevant marketing messages to consumers visiting the dealer's Website. Email Manager provides, on behalf of the dealers, follow up e-mails to consumers who have submitted Leads on scheduled intervals following a consumer's Lead submission. After submission of a Lead, Lead Call provides a live phone call to the dealer to ensure that the dealer contacts the consumer in a timely manner. Payment Pro is a dealer Website conversion tool that offers consumers real-time online monthly payment information based on an instant qualification process. The payments are based on the consumer's credit, the actual vehicle being researched and the dealer finance rates without requiring the consumer to provide personal information, such as date of birth or social security number.It provides dealers and manufacturers with a suite of mobile technologies that facilitate communication between dealers and car buyers on smart phones and tablets. At the center of this platform is Autobytel's TextShield product that offers dealers the ability to connect with consumers using text communication through a platform that protects the consumer's privacy. In addition, it offers dealers mobile Websites designed to drive consumer engagement with dealers, as well as mobile applications, text message marketing and the ability for consumers to send information to their mobile devices using its send to phone product.Advertising ProgramsThe Company's Websites help the audience of automotive buyers that advertisers can focus through display advertising. A primary way advertisers use its Websites to reach consumers is through vehicle content focusing. The Company's Websites also offer manufacturers the opportunity to feature their makes and models within contextual content. Through the advertising placements, manufacturers can direct consumers to their respective Websites for further information. The Company also offers a direct marketing platform that enables manufacturers to selectively focus in-market consumers during the often-extended vehicle shopping process. Designed to keep a specific automotive brand in consideration, the Company's direct marketing programs allow automotive marketers to deliver specific communication through either e-mail or direct mail formats to in-market consumers during their purchase cycle.

On Nov 15, 2004, Autobytel announced to restate results for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2003, the full 2003 fiscal year, and the first and second quarters of 2004, due to its accounting problems covering a number of issues surfaced after the disclosure of a review by its audit committee. After further review, on March 15, 2005, the Company announced that it also expected to restate its financial statements for the full 2002 fiscal year and the first fiscal quarter of 2003.[6]
In 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against Autobytel alleging that it violated Securities Exchange Act by disseminating false statements and inflating its financial results.[7]
The financial crisis of 2008 forced the company to reduce costs primarily by laying off a big portion of the workforce.[8] It also considered selling itself, but that plan was tabled in 2009.[8] The FY2012 results showed a small profit, suggesting the layoff strategy worked at keeping the business running until the economy recovered.
In late 2013 Autobytel purchased a portion of Autoweb.com, a targeted automotive advertising company[9] In early 2014, Autobytel purchased AutoUSA from AutoNation Inc. for $10 million in cash, a $1 million convertible note and other consideration.[10] In May 2015, Autobytel acquired Dealix Corporation and Autotegrity, Inc. (wholly owned subsidiaries of CDK Global, LLC), for $25 million.[11] On October 1, 2015, Autobytel acquired Autoweb, Inc. in an all-stock and warrant transaction.[12]
