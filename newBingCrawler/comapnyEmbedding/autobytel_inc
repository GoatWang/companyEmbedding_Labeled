The Company operates through providing automotive marketing services segment. The Company's consumer-facing automotive Websites, which include its Website Autobytel.com, provide consumers with information and tools to aid them with the automotive purchase decisions and the ability to submit inquiries requesting dealers to contact the consumers regarding purchasing or leasing vehicles. Its AutoWeb pay-per-click advertising marketplace program uses technology to refer in-market consumer traffic to dealers and manufacturer Websites. For consumers not be able to secure loans through conventional lending sources, the Websites provide these consumers the ability to submit inquiries requesting dealers or other lenders that may offer vehicle financing to these consumers to contact the consumers regarding vehicle financing.Leads are internally-generated from its Websites (Internally-Generated Leads) or acquired from third parties (Non-Internally-Generated Leads) that generate Leads from their Websites (Non-Company Websites). The Company sells Internally-Generated Leads and Non-Internally-Generated Leads directly to Dealers and indirectly to dealers through a wholesale market consisting of manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive Lead distribution industry. In conjunction with its Lead programs, the Company also offers dealers and manufacturers other products and services, including the iControl by Autobytel, WebLeads+, Email Marketing Manager, Payment Pro, and Lead Call products and services, to assist them in capturing online, in-market customers and selling more vehicles by improving conversion of Leads to sale transactions.Vehicle Lead ProgramsThe Company provides dealers and manufacturers with opportunities to market their vehicles to vehicle buyers.

For consumers using its Websites, the Company provides research information, including vehicle specification data, safety data, pricing data, photos, videos, regional rebate and incentive data, and additional tools, such as the compare and configuration tools. The Company also provides additional content on its Websites, including the database of articles, such as consumer and professional reviews, and other analyses. Additional automotive information is also available on its Websites to assist consumers with specific vehicle research, such as the trade-in value of their current vehicle.The Company's Vehicle Lead program for vehicles allows consumers to submit requests for pricing and availability of specific makes and models. A Vehicle Lead provides information regarding the make and model of a vehicle, and may also include additional data regarding the consumer's needs, including any vehicle trade-in, whether the consumer wishes to lease or buy, and other options for the vehicle acquisition decision. The Company's used Vehicle Lead program allows consumers to search for used vehicles according to specific search parameters, such as the price, make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. The consumer is able to locate and display the description, price and, if available, digital images of vehicles that satisfy the consumer's search parameters. The consumer can then submit a Lead for additional information regarding a specific vehicle that it delivers to the dealer offering the vehicle. In addition to sending Leads directly to dealers through the Lead delivery system, consumers may choose to contact the dealer using a number posted next to the vehicle search results.Finance Lead ProgramThe Company's Finance Lead program provides consumers who may not be able to secure loans through conventional lending sources the opportunity to obtain vehicle financing and other services from dealers or financial institutions offering vehicle financing to these consumers. Consumers can submit a request for vehicle financing or submit a credit questionnaire for a credit report or other credit services that are provided by third party providers. The Company has a call center program that consists of telephone surveys of Finance Lead consumers. In addition, the Company inquires about the consumer's interest in obtaining information or quotes for relevant products and services, including credit report repair and vehicle loan refinancing, offered by third parties.Other Dealer Products and ServicesIn conjunction with the automotive Vehicle Lead programs, the Company also offers products and services that assist dealers in connecting with in-market consumers and closing vehicle sales, including iControl by Autobytel, WebLeads+, Email Manager and Lead Call, Payment Pro, Mobile Products and Services, and SaleMove Products and Services. iControl by Autobytel is its technology that allows dealers many options to filter and control the volume and source of their Vehicle Leads. iControl by Autobytel can be controlled at the dealership or at the dealer group level from a Web-based console. From the console, dealerships can contract or expand territories and increase, restrict or block specific models and Lead Web sources.WebLeads+ offers a dealer multiple coupon options that display relevant marketing messages to consumers visiting the dealer's Website. Email Manager provides, on behalf of the dealers, follow up e-mails to consumers who have submitted Leads on scheduled intervals following a consumer's Lead submission. After submission of a Lead, Lead Call provides a live phone call to the dealer to ensure that the dealer contacts the consumer in a timely manner. Payment Pro is a dealer Website conversion tool that offers consumers real-time online monthly payment information based on an instant qualification process. The payments are based on the consumer's credit, the actual vehicle being researched and the dealer finance rates without requiring the consumer to provide personal information, such as date of birth or social security number.It provides dealers and manufacturers with a suite of mobile technologies that facilitate communication between dealers and car buyers on smart phones and tablets. At the center of this platform is Autobytel's TextShield product that offers dealers the ability to connect with consumers using text communication through a platform that protects the consumer's privacy. In addition, it offers dealers mobile Websites designed to drive consumer engagement with dealers, as well as mobile applications, text message marketing and the ability for consumers to send information to their mobile devices using its send to phone product.Advertising ProgramsThe Company's Websites help the audience of automotive buyers that advertisers can focus through display advertising.

The Company's Websites also offer manufacturers the opportunity to feature their makes and models within contextual content. Through the advertising placements, manufacturers can direct consumers to their respective Websites for further information. The Company also offers a direct marketing platform that enables manufacturers to selectively focus in-market consumers during the often-extended vehicle shopping process.

Autobytel to Sell its Specialty Finance Leads Product to Internet Brands








        December 20, 2016
      

        IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 20, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Autobytel Inc. (NASDAQ:ABTL), a pioneer and leading provider of digital automotive services connecting in-market car buyers with dealers and OEMs, has signed a definitive agreement to sell its specialty finance leads (SFL) product to Internet Brands, Inc.


        Total consideration for the SFL product includes $3.2 million of cash, as well as additional transition licensing income totaling $1.6 million over a five-year period. The transaction is expected to close on December 31, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.
      

        For calendar year 2016, SFL revenue is expected to be $6.4 million, with $0.5 million of contribution to operating income. For 2015, SFL revenue was $6.5 million, with $0.5 million of contribution to operating income.
      

        'This divestiture will enable us to further dedicate time and resources to our fastest-growing business initiatives - our core vehicle lead and click products,' said Jeff Coats, President and CEO of Autobytel. 'We believe divesting this non-core asset is in the best interest of our stockholders as we redeploy the proceeds from the sale back into our core business.'
      

Tax Benefit Preservation Plan
        At December 31, 2015, the company had approximately $88.2 million in available net operating loss carryforwards ('NOLs') for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The company's Tax Benefit Preservation Plan ('Plan') was adopted by the company's Board of Directors to preserve the company's NOLs and other tax attributes and thus reduce the risk of a possible change of ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any such change of ownership under Section 382 would limit or eliminate the ability of the company to use its existing NOLs for federal income tax purposes. Rights issued under the Plan could be triggered upon the acquisition by any person or group of 4.9% or more of the company's outstanding common stock and could result in substantial dilution of the acquirer's percentage ownership in the company. As of October 31, 2016, there were 10,962,330 shares of the company's common stock, $0.001 par value, outstanding. There is no guarantee that the Plan will achieve the objective of preserving the value of the company's NOLs. For more information, please visit http://investor.autobytel.com/tax.cfm.

Autobytel Inc. Announced as Finalist for Innovatiove Product Award 
Irvine CA, April 27, 2006 - Autobytel Inc. (Nasdaq: ABTL) was announced Wednesday as a finalist for Innovative Product (2005) by the Orange County council of AeA—the largest technology trade association in the United States. 

Autobytel was recognized for the development of its advanced proprietary search engine marketing technology, named "Black Condor'", which plays an essential role in funneling in-market auto shoppers from Internet search engines to the company's nationwide network of auto dealers - at a fraction of the cost of traditional advertising. In 2005, the company's search engine marketing generated an estimated $1.4 billion in gross revenue for its member dealers, and twenty million Autobytel web pages were listed on major search engines in January 2006.

Search engine marketing has become a highly competitive market as search engines such as Google and Yahoo! conduct online auctions to sell popular search words (keywords) to businesses that want to present their ads and information to Internet searchers. Autobytel's search technology is capable of sorting through 500,000 of the most sought after automotive keywords on the major search engines, making bids for the keywords 1,600+ times an hour. Black Condor also creates dynamic landing pages with relevant make and model information for most of the 500,000 key words. 

According to the Pew Internet Life and American Project, nearly 60 million U.S. Internet searchers used search engines daily in 2005. J.D. Power & Associates, the global marketing information firm, reports that in 2005 ninety percent of all Internet new vehicle shoppers used a search engine during their shopping process. 

"We are extremely proud that our technology has been recognized by a prestigious organization like AeA," said Autobytel CEO and President James Riesenbach. "Black Condor has been instrumental in furthering our mission of efficiently connecting millions of in-market car shoppers to auto dealers across America, making the car shopping experience easier for consumers and car retailers alike."

Autobytel's technology was developed by Autobytel's Internet technology and marketing teams, led by Senior Director of Search Operations Zane Rathwick.

The winner will be announced May 18 at AeA’s 13th Annual High Tech Innovation Awards, which will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza. Other awards categories include: Outstanding Company, Outstanding Public Company CEO, Outstanding Private Company CEO, Outstanding Woman in Technology, High Impact Person of the Year, Innovative Product of 2005, and the Greg Ross Community Service Award.  For the first time in the event’s history, education awards also will be given for District Leadership, Innovative School Program and High Impact Teacher of the Year (all in Science, Math and Technology).

The event will feature John Gage, Chief Researcher and Director of the Science Office for Sun Microsystems, Inc., as keynote speaker along with prominent leaders of Orange County technology companies as presenters. Messages from business, education, and political leaders will develop this year’s theme, “The Race to Innovate.”  Jonathan Lansner, business columnist for the Orange County Register, will serve as Master of Ceremonies.

The education awards, sponsored by Project Tomorrow—the nation’s leading non-profit group promoting science, math and technology in schools—reflect both organizations’ push for a more competitive U.S. workforce.

Autobytel Completes Sale of Specialty Finance Leads Product to Internet Brands








        January 3, 2017
      

        IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Autobytel Inc. (NASDAQ:ABTL), a pioneer and leading provider of digital automotive services connecting in-market car buyers with dealers and OEMs, has completed the sale of its specialty finance leads (SFL) product to Internet Brands, Inc.


        Total consideration includes $3.2 million of cash as well as additional transition licensing income totaling $1.6 million over a five-year period.
      

        SFL revenue in 2016 is expected to be $6.4 million with $0.5 million of contribution to operating income. In 2015, SFL revenue and operating income contribution was $6.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
      

        With the sale, Autobytel will dedicate further resources to its fastest-growing core vehicle lead and click products.
      

Tax Benefit Preservation Plan
        At December 31, 2015, the company had approximately $88.2 million in available net operating loss carryforwards ('NOLs') for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The company's Tax Benefit Preservation Plan ('Plan') was adopted by the company's Board of Directors to preserve the company's NOLs and other tax attributes and thus reduce the risk of a possible change of ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any such change of ownership under Section 382 would limit or eliminate the ability of the company to use its existing NOLs for federal income tax purposes. Rights issued under the Plan could be triggered upon the acquisition by any person or group of 4.9% or more of the company's outstanding common stock and could result in substantial dilution of the acquirer's percentage ownership in the company. As of October 31, 2016, there were 10,962,330 shares of the company's common stock, $0.001 par value, outstanding. There is no guarantee that the Plan will achieve the objective of preserving the value of the company's NOLs. For more information, please visit http://investor.autobytel.com/tax.cfm.
