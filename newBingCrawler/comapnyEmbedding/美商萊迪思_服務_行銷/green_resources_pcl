CPF Products for Sustainability




CPF’s Product Sustainability Based on Product Life Cycle Assessment



                            Committed to sustainable development, CPF is aware of economic, social and environmental challenges to 
                            strengthen our business to become the leading food manufacturer. 
                            CPF’s Product Sustainability was thus established by applying life cycle assessment to our supply chain (farm to fork) 
                            to design and develop production processes, achieving the CPF green value chain. 
                            Consumers can be assured that our products are high in quality and safety while being traceable. 
                            In addition, the consumers play significant roles in promoting efficient use of resources, 
                            leading to sustainable consumption for the future generations.
                        





The success of CPF’s Product Sustainability is that our fresh and cooked chicken products have been certified to ProSustain standard by DNV GL, the global leader, since 2013. Obtaining a ProSustain certificate has allowed CPF to be the world’s first producer having sustainable chicken products. We are so proud of accomplishing all levels of the standard


Level 1: Corporate Sustainability Management Standard
Level 2: Product Sustainability Management Standard
Level 3: Product Sustainability Performance Standard


More than 700 certified CPF productsare available in Thailand andEuropean countries. All being exported to EU markets are sustainable food items.






                            CPF's Product Sustainability is designed and developed under resource efficiency throughout the 
                            CPF green value chain including feedmill, farm, processing plant and distribution to consumers as well as waste disposal. 
                            This is to create sustainable products with an emphasis on four dimensions: food quality and safety, environment, society, and economy.
                        






                           Sustainability performance for the chicken products is evaluated using eco-efficiency analysis accredited by the US National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), USA. 
                           The performance outputs are also verified by the third party, TUV Rheinland, Germany.
                        


Turning waste into energy



                            CPF is aware that waste being generated will greatly have negative impacts on environment and society. In addition, turning waste into energy used for production processes a circular business model - is suitable for securing the energy resource. 
                            Therefore, waste associated with and obtained from our food supply chain is recovered. For examples,
                        


Agricultural waste purchased from farmers is converted to biomass energy to produce steam for process of manufacturing animal feed.
Animal manure from farms is utilized as fertilizer for growing crops.
Wastewater from farms and food processing plants is subjected to treatments to generate biogas, an alternative fuel. Air pollution is then decreased while only treated wastewater is discharged to river.
Consumers’ health is our main safety concern. Therefore, high-quality fresh vegetable oil is only used for frying. In addition, used frying oil is then reprocessed to biodiesel fuel used for transportation.



                            CPF is strongly determined to convey a value of product sustainability to consumers all over the world. It is relatively a journey with endless processes of designing and developing sustainable products. It is also involved in recent social issues on efficient use of resources and environment for the sustainable growth.
