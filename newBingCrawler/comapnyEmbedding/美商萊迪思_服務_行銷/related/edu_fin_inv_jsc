In a rapidly changing world, ERM works with clients and other leading organizations to navigate the risks and opportunities for business associated with the transition to a lower-carbon future, the digital transformation and other megatrends.
Our new Sustainability Report profiles how we address these complex challenges for our clients, and with other leading organizations.

The Report also sets out ERM’s response to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs provide a global framework for action in which businesses can shore-up their longer-term financial sustainability, while making a meaningful contribution to the social and environmental capital that underpins it. ERM is contributing to the SDGs through the work we do with clients, through our internal operations, and through the ERM Foundation.
