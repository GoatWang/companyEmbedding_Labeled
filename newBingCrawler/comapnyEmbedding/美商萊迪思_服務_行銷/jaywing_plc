Jaywing plc announces launch of new product for IFRS 9 compliance


LONDON UK - 21 September 2016 - Jaywing plc (LSE: JWNG)  Jaywing plc, a data science led marketing, analytics and risk management agency, is pleased to announce that it has launched a new product, Horizon, aimed at helping lenders meet IFRS 9 compliance requirements.


The new global accounting standard IFRS 9 requires lenders to adhere to a new methodology for the calculation of provisions from January 2018.  As retail credit risk and data science experts, Jaywing plc has been working with lenders on meeting the requirements of the new regulation since 2014, including elevenof the UK's leadingfinancial services institutions.  Jaywing's expertise in this specialist field extends over many years and offers lenders skills that are difficult to find internally, elsewhere or at the necessary scale.


As the deadline draws closer, it is increasingly imperative that all affected lenders are in the process of switching to the new regulatory standard due to the requirement to run the new models in parallel with existing processes.  To help smaller lenders meet the regulation and larger lenders validate their models, Jaywing has encapsulated its extensive regulation experience and expertise into new product Horizon.


Horizon enables lenders to meet all aspects of the IFRS 9 impairment standardquickly and cost-effectively while supporting stress testing,ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process)and bad debt forecasting processes.


IFRS 9 will be a significant change to the financial reporting of banks and other lenders and affects many stakeholders, including investors, regulators, analysts and auditors.  A high-quality and effective implementation of the standard will maintain confidence in the financial results of lending organisations.


Horizon deals with all aspects of IFRS 9 impairment modelling using feeds of a lenders' own data and macro-economic data.  The model engine, developed using machine learning and artificial intelligence, combines Probablity of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) components to calculate life time Expected Credit Losses (ECL) under different economic scenarios.


It offers lenders a user-friendly interface to adjust the models to their individual requirements while providing the necessary transparency for all components of the solution.  More importantly, it affords lenders the opportunity to avoid lengthy and expensive projects or significant ongoing maintenance overheads while still meeting regulatory requirements by the deadline.


Martin Boddy, Chief Executive, Jaywing plc, said, 'We're delighted to bring such an advanced product to the market. With eleven UK lending organisations using Jaywing for their IFRS 9 implementations and countless previous IAS 39, Basel, Stress Testing and other banking regulation analytics engagements, our expertise in this field is peerless. Our data science credentials and ability to manage and corral big data have enabled us to develop an accessible product for lenders least likely to have access to quality skills and experience in-house or even through contractor resource. 


'This is just one application of data science we've been able to bring to market and follows the introduction of our marketing product Almanac, which brings together online and offline, including structured and unstructured, behavioural data to deliver marketing applications such as highly personalised communications across channels including online display, email and direct mail; attribution modelling; abandoned baskets programmes; predicting lapsing customers and promotion econometrics.  This kind of advanced approach to data science is absolutely the future of business.'

About Jaywing plc


Jaywing is home to over 600 of the best thinkers across creative, technology and data science, with over one in 10 of its employees a heavyweight data scientist.


Jaywing plc's recent results reported revenue of £36m (c. A$62m), Gross Profit of £31.8m and an organic increase in Gross Profit and adjusted EBITDA of 6% and 7% respectively with better than expected after-tax profit.


Culturally and operationally, Jaywing has a 'one company' strategy, rather than the traditional agency group model, and attributes its success with clients to this approach.


In July 2015, Jaywing indicated a desire to follow a low risk international growth strategy for distribution of its data science led products.  Its recent acquisitions of Bloom in the UK and Digital Massive in Australia are in service of the fulfillment of that strategy.


In March 2016, the company announced a major collaboration with Imperial College's Data Science Institute (DSI) to undertake a three-year research programme designed to measure, understand and predict people's emotional response to marketing stimuli that has been adopted into its creative methodology. The research involves the use of advanced technology, including the DSI's impressive Data Observatory facility and advanced neuroimaging kit.  In July 2016, the company furthered its academic links with a partnership with the University of Leeds to help deliver its new MSc in Consumer Analytics and Marketing Strategy course, bringing real life challenges to academic learning.


Jaywing works with a number of national and international blue chip clients, including Sky, Pepsico, 3M, Anytime Fitness, HSBC, Wedgwood, Castrol, Kempinski and Pandora.

Our Strategy and Team










Jaywing is a data science-led agency and consulting business with a marketing technology division and the beginnings of an international footprint. 
 
Head quartered Sheffield, we also have offices in Leeds, Newbury and Swindon, with a small sales team in London and an operation in Sydney, Australia.  
 
We employ around 650 people, of which 1 in 10 is an experienced Data Scientist.  We’ve worked hard to create a highly collaborative operating model and culture that has resulted in 1 in 3 of our top 50 clients buying more than one of our service lines.   
 
Our agency has two core propositions, performance marketing and brand-led marketing.
 
Performance marketing: where clients rely on us to generate their sales, using search marketing, programmatic display and email.
 
Brand-led marketing: where clients such as Pepsi and Castrol have switched from traditional channels, such as TV, in favour of using high quality content in social media and other digital channels to engage specific audiences.
 
Our data science consultancy helps clients do smart things with their data for marketing or risk. 
 
Marketing practice: we manage on and offline data and use it to build and execute highly personalised customer experiences. We also help clients understand more about their customers and how their marketing activities have performed, including the use of highly sophisticated attribution modelling.
 
Risk practice: we work closely with lenders to build statistical models to satisfy banking regulation, such as calculating capital requirements.  This is a very specialist field and one in which we are a major player in the UK.
 
Our Marketing Tech is branded Jaywing Intelligence.  It uses cutting edge technology including artificial intelligence and virtual reality to deliver unique data and insights as well as time saving automation, across a range of applications. 
 
Business Model
 
Overall 60% of contracted revenues are recurring, resulting in two thirds of our gross profit being visible 6 months in advance and half being visible 12 months in advance. 
 
In our agency, performance-led marketing contracts typically range from £6k to £50k per month for 12 to 18 month terms.  Contracts for brand-led marketing are typically 2–3 year framework agreements with long-standing clients in addition to contracts for discrete projects for smaller or newer clients.
 
The work we do in our consulting business tends to be procured on a project basis, typically between 3 and 12 months for long-established clients.
 
The contracts for our marketing technology are a mix of licence fees and support agreements.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is to innovate, scale and grow.
 
Innovate: by developing new applications of data science and new marketing technology.
 
Scale: through international expansion, be that distributing our marketing technology via third parties or through the acquisition of complementary businesses.
 
Grow: by actively managing our client relationships and continuing to increase the level of cross sales.

Modern Slavery Act 2015 – Annual Statement April 2016
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 is concerned with matters of slavery and human trafficking and in particular addresses the wider issue of supply chain accountability. Below is Jaywing plc’s statement for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Jaywing plc
Jaywing plc is a professional services organisation that has a number of subsidiary companies and operating divisions for financial reporting but operationally is managed as a single organisation. Rob Shaw, CEO UK & Australia, is responsible for our people and operational matters. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy sets out our policy in relation to slavery and human trafficking matters.

Within our own business operations in the UK and Australia we mostly employ people into professional services roles with a professional services background. We have strict policies regarding age and working hours, we conduct ID verification and right to work checks for all and apply additional vetting checks for many that can include Disclosure Scotland and credit reports.

As the majority of our expenditure is essentially people cost, the greatest risk of slavery and human trafficking is in our supply chain, which is relatively small and limited to a few services.

Our supply chain

Within our supply chain, we use reputable firms for items such as computer hardware and software, mobile phones, furniture, stationery, merchandise, cleaning and maintenance consumables and services, print production, etc. Furthermore, we ask our people to be vigilant when making purchases on expenses through knowledge of our policy.

As our supplier chain is relatively small and mostly limited to large organisations, we aim to keep ourselves updated of any companies suspected of modern slavery by performing an annual desk research review of our biggest suppliers. If we discovered impropriety via this or any other mechanism, we would react as necessary.

Jaywing strengthens board with appointment of Epiphany’s Rob Shaw and Consulting MD Adrian Lingard
07 July 2015 / Jaywing










                        With a strong set of results and some ambitious plans, Jaywing has today announced the promotion of Epiphany CEO, Rob Shaw, to Jaywing CEO UK & Australia and Consulting MD, Adrian Lingard, to Jaywing COO, with both also appointed to the plc board.


Shaw will assume responsibility for agency management across the plc. Lingard takes on a plc wide commercial management role, while retaining oversight of the firm’s consultancy operations. Current COO Andy Gardner moves to Chief Strategy Officer with specific focus on international distribution, product development and M&A activity, signalling a new and focused strategic direction for Jaywing. Mike Sprot is promoted to Chief Financial Officer and Martin Boddy remains at the helm as CEO of Jaywing plc.


The role left vacant by Shaw will be filled by Epiphany’s Strategy Director, Tom Salmon while Lingard’s senior team will see an increase in their responsibilities.


The board appointments reflect a tightening of focus to build upon strong results revealed today that see a 39% increase in GP to £30.1 million with a fourth consecutive period of EBITDA growth, which is up 75% on 2014 results. Jaywing also cites full integration and strong contribution from its Epiphany acquisition in March 2014.


Jaywing plc CEO, Martin Boddy’s statement highlighted the firm’s new brand positioning “making sense of now”. The proposition has the company’s strong data credentials at the heart of a business that helps its clients make sense of the ever more complex multi-channel, multi-device world they operate in; bringing together on and offline data to produce unique insights and algorithms to power highly personalised display advertising, websites and email programmes that distinguish between non, new and existing customers.


Boddy also set out a strategy to capitalise on its “strong platform for growth”, which sees a continued focus on activities that will benefit from the use of data science and a clear intention to be at the forefront of developments in data science. He also states that the company will develop new product sets and explore options to generate international sales and domestic opportunities that will deliver synergies and scale.


He sums up by saying “We have an exciting strategy that will see Jaywing move ever further away from being ‘another’ marketing agency group to being a marketing agency specialising in data science and working in areas of growing marketing spend. A business that has both a high level of resilience and a strong platform for domestic and international growth. And of course, a business with some exceptional people working in a highly collaborative environment for blue chip clients.”
