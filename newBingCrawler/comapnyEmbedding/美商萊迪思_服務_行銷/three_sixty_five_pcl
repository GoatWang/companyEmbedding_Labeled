What A Weird Wednesday


























Today I woke up thinking, what in the world is going on this week and how in the WORLD is it only Wednesday?! 



I feel like I've gotten SO much information and so many things have happened since Sunday night, and I'm having a heck of a time processing it all. Let me try to break this down for you. In 48 hours, all of this happened:



1. 2 Facetime calls.

2. I had a meeting with the Grundy County deputy while at work yesterday.

3. I got my transcript evaluation and basically the next 2 years of my life mapped out (more on this later)

4. A doctor's appointment.

5. My Chicago trip was canceled.

6. I found out my grandma is having surgery this week.

7. The first day of dance practice and parent meeting dates were set. 



I know I'm evading a lot of details in this list, but I just truly can't believe how much has gone on in such a short time period! Life, you guys. It's been a crazy one lately, but most of it is good, and it sure has kept things interesting!



I'm looking forward to getting some more blog posts here soon and filling you in more on both the big and little things happening around here! Until then, I'll be over here looking forward to Friday!

Our Weekend // 7.22.17






Finally, two weeks later, I thought I'd get a quick weekend recap post up from the end of July. 



This was a really good weekend, for no real particular reason. We didn't have a lot planned, but it was nice couple of days spent together and I'm glad we got to enjoy sleeping in and drinking coffee together. Alas! Let us get this post rolling.



Friday night was a family wedding, in which I had no PTO and could not leave work early for, so Jeff met up with his family at the wedding and had a really great time celebrating his cousin's marriage.



Meanwhile, I decided to get another run in that night, which totally paid off because it resulted in a huge weight goal being reached the next morning!! Love it. Feels so good to make and reach goals!







Finley Reed had a very relaxing weekend with her new best friend. 






Saturday was a great day. Jeff went to the lake to a friend's cabin in the morning and I went to Target for my weekly errand running and Starbucks treat.






We had a pretty low key night of baseball throwing and frisbee fetching, and these two loves of my life were just plain worn out!





Sunday was reserved for golf. Jeff got a pass for free golfing here in Grundy Center from our neighbor Gloria. It was Jeff's first time golfing on that course and I had a blast riding along and enjoying some sunshine and Nike advertising ;).












Sunday evening was a bunch of Survivor watching and Finley cuddling. It was a great weekend full of recharging and I went into the next week feeling renewed and ready to take it on!

July // 2017



















Reading: my calendar for the upcoming fall season and trying to stay calm ;). I'm excited for all the awesome things coming my way, but also aware that it will be a little challenging to juggle it all! Here goes nothin'!Wanting: to keep up these healthy habits and keep moving forward! I feel amazing right now and it's nice to know that I'm able to feel this way and get my body here all on my own, I just have to put forth the effort! Sometimes I get nervous about how my postnatal body will recover one day, but knowing that I can get to here from where I've already been before puts my mind at ease. And the healthier/more fit I am before a future pregnancy, the easier it will all be to lose!Looking: forward to an upcoming trip to Chicago!Playing: a million songs trying to put together our state mixes for dance team already! How is it that time of year?!Wasting: time on social media at night before bed, but that's nothing new. GO TO BED STEPHANIEWishing: that fall weather lasted like 5 months instead of 3 days ;)Enjoying: life these days. I really think that it's all about your outlook, and your attitude towards things can truly change your feelings and lift your spirits.Waiting: to get things rolling with a big life goal that I'll talk more about soon!Liking: sleeping with a fan on these days. It's more for sound than anything (we started it during firework season as a distraction for Fin) but it's become a comforting lull each night.Loving: that dance tryouts are next week and I finally get to see my girls and teach a routine again! The juices are flowing and I'm getting the itch to coach again - right on schedule.Marveling: at the fact that I just signed up for a half marathon the other day. My goodness, I'm at it again ;). (only half crazy this time though)Needing: to plan my week's workouts ahead of time. Sometimes I'm already walking down the block to start my run before I've even decided how far I'm going to go LOL. I need to set a plan and work off of it. Also needing some kind of intervention for my adult acne. Ugh, hormones!

Watching: 73 Questions on YouTube. It's a Vogue thing where they go to celebrities' houses and rapid fire questions at them. It's a little bit cheesy at times but I still love seeing their houses and learning about them as real people. I think I like most of them better in their roles as actors though haha.

Smelling: apples! I've whipped out the fall candles and I'm not ashamed!

Wearing: shorts and tanks everyday and wishing it was jeans and cardigans lol It's too hottt

Noticing: how much drinking water really does aid in my health! I feel so much better when I'm getting lots of h2o during the day and it's been nice to stray from consuming so much coffee. Don't get me wrong - coffee will forever be my favorite hug in the morning, but it should be more of a treat than an ongoing hydration source.Knowing: more about how my younger brother viewed our childhood after having a great talk with him last weekend. It's funny how different our perceptions were of the same events and it was a blast to pick his brain and see things through his eyes a little bit. I loved reminiscing with him and it blows my mind how mature he's become! Also, it was nice to hear that I wasn't as bad of a big sister as I thought I was ;).Thinking: how crazy it is that my brother-in-law is now ENGAGED! It happened this week on their camping trip and I'm so thrilled for them. He's truly a brother to me, and I'm just super excited that he found his happiness.Bookmarking: crop tops.... if I dare say so lol. I finally feel more comfortable in my body and I love the look of them for working out and dancing!

Holding: Maverick a little tighter the next time I see him! Poor baby is in the hospital after having a seizure the other night and I just want him to be all better and get back to his sweet, happy little self! :(Feeling:

A Selfie Weekend // 7.15.17






Since my phone's camera was broken all weekend, and selfies were the only option, this weekend recap is chuck full of good ole front facing camera goodies.



Friday night when we got back to Eagle Grove, we headed straight to a family friend's house for a bit of a dinner party! It was really nice outside and we had a blast sitting around and chatting in the summer air with some toddies.







We had a delicious smoked meat dinner and enjoyed the company and drinks for a while, before Jeff got invited to play some darts up at the bar. We left to check on our puppy before heading up there, and this is her just chilling at her grandparents' lol. This is the only photo that's not a selfie because Jeff snapped it to me haha.








We had such a great time up town playing (and watching) darts. It was a typical summer night at our hometown bar, and it was refreshing to get to spend it with my husband after a long week of night shifts.




 The next morning was a really slow one. I had planned to run, but Friday night had kind of gotten the best of me and so we slept in and took our time getting ready for the day.







We went to a memorial at my grandma's house for my Uncle Mo who lived in Germany, which was the real reason we made the trip home for the weekend. Since his funeral was overseas, we all got together at my grandma's house to celebrate his life and reunite the siblings. It was a GREAT turn out and I got to see lots of family that I haven't seen in years. It was really nice and I'm super glad that we were able to come home for it. I really really really wish that I had a working camera for the memorial though. It was such a special occasion to have us all in the same place at the same time and I know I didn't take nearly enough advantage of it as I should have. I'm just really glad that my grandma and my mom got to spend so much time with their loved ones and make the most out of this terrible situation. Mo would have really loved that afternoon.



After our family time was finished, we headed out to the golf course for Jeff to get some swings in. We ended up hooking up with a friend out there and I'm sure Jeff was thrilled to actually have someone to play with rather than just his wife who sits in the cart and drinks the whole time ;). They ended up playing something like 21 holes and it was like Heaven on Earth for JPR.









So it was also the fair in good ole Wright County, and our plan was to have supper out there and get the famous chicken and noodles. It was starting to get late and the guys decided to play another round until the sun went down, so I made my way into town and got the fair goodies to-go and brought it back out to the course. It was hotttttt out there, but that comfort food was still worth it. It was delicious and well worth the trip into town!







We made it a pretty early night and went to bed at a decent time. We woke up on Sunday and had another slow and easy morning. There was coffee and some crossword puzzles and delicious homemade salads to get us going for the day. Before we knew it, we were on our way home and it was already Sunday night. Survivor, laundry, meal prep, and Monday preparations were in full swing and the weekend was wrapped up wayyy before I wanted it to be. But thus, here we are in a new week with new goals and to-do lists and I'm rockin' and rollin' just waiting for the next weekend ahead :).



Hope you're having a great week and I also hope my camera decides to work so I can provide you with more than selfies next weekend!

A Sappy Saturday Night






I shared this post on my Instagram, but it was very much like a blog post I would write, so I thought I'd share it on this space too.






Four things on this Saturday night:



1. I broke my phone and now I'm stuck with my old one until September and so this is the kind of camera quality I get until then.



2. We literally golfed until the sun went down tonight and I can't help but think about how much we will miss these days one day when our family grows and our "freedom" diminishes. While I can't wait for that chapter of our story, I still really love the one we are in.



3. It's really cool to me to think that I used to watch Jeff run this same golf course during his high school cross country day... a whole 11+ years ago. If that 14 year old girl with a crush only knew...



4. I got some fair food to go and brought it out to the golf course for our dinner tonight and there's nothing as delicious as fair chicken and noodles, even if it is 95 degrees. 



Summer weekends, man. there's nothing better.

Four Things Friday // 7.14.17















1. Egg yolk masks. You need to do them. I need to do them. Every. Single. Day. I seriously have found nothing that helps my hormonal acne more than an egg yolk mask does! It blows my mind! I wake up with so much less redness and my face is instantly better after I start doing this. It's a bit of a mess, so I don't always do it, but I need to keep it up nightly because the benefits are totally worth the hassle!



2. Softball is over around here, which means it's time to get the dance season up and going again! I'm getting excited and I think I'm ready for the craziness to ensue once again. I'm feeling inspired lately, so hopefully I'll get lots of choreographing done while I'm still hot! This fall is gonna be NUTS.



3. The other day Jeff was dancing around the house and being a goof and I was kind of in a blah mood, so I didn't join in. He kept urging me to be crazy with him and I just wasn't feeling it. I watched him for a bit and then went on to get chores done and now, 5 days later, I'm still thinking about how I should've just dropped what I was doing and joined him. One of my forever favorite things about this guy is how freaking FUN he is! He makes me more goofy (usually) and I'm just a better person when I'm around him if I just LET myself let go and join in. I've regretted turning him down all week long and just want to use this as a lesson to myself to let go and always always join my husband in his shenanigans. So Jeff, if you're reading this - I'm sorry for being a Debbie Downer, and I owe you a dance.



4. My phone is officially kaput and I'm reallyyyy struggling about it. I had a case of the touch disease, which is where the phone literally will do nothing when you touch the screen - SO FRUSTRATING! I was constantly having to bend the phone certain ways just to try to trigger the screen again and it was ridiculous. It would take me like ten minutes to be able to respond to a text message lol. So anyways, I've switched back to my iPhone 5 for the time being - until the new one comes out in late September. It was so nice to be able to use the screen at first and I thought it was actually kind of refreshing to switch back. But now, a couple weeks in I'm finding myself HATING this old clunker. The screen is tiny, it's basically completely out of storage, the camera take terribllllle photos (like the one of Jeff and Fin from last nights post *blurry city*) and now just as of last night, only the front facing camera will work! The flashlight and the regular camera won't even turn on and it feels like my life is ruined ;). Haha but really HOW am I supposed to blog if I can't take photos???? How am I supposed to LIVE if I can't take photos?! Drama, drama, drama ;)

Around Here Lately // July So Far






Here's a few pretty uneventful photos from my camera roll. None of them really go together, but it's the easiest way for me to show you what us Reeds have been up to around here lately, so here we have it!

 

I have to admit up front here - the Fourth of July really cut into my healthy habits. It was only a couple of days without running or dieting, but my goodness it didn't take long AT ALL to start feeling yucky again! It's crazy what processed food does to you, and kind of disgusting. It makes it easier to say no to it again when I think about how bad it must be for me if it makes me feel that way, and it truly never is worth it.

 

All that to say - I'm back at it full force and ready to make some progress again.

 



 

When Jeff has his days off during the week (which happens a lot) he sometimes likes to go back home and golf, even just for the day. He's also so sweet and takes Finny along for the ride so she can see her cousin and I always get such cute little selfies from their trip :). 




 

Last weekend was pretty nonproductive on my part, but it was super nice to hang at home with my hubby before he went in to work. We got to have our morning coffee together and watch our favorite show. (any guesses on which show? HA!) I love any time we get to spend together, especially now that he's been on nights and I haven't seen him in 5 days :(.﻿




 

Finley Reed has the best dad ever (duh) who's been giving her daily spa treatments lately. She's the softest, fluffiest, and best smelling puppy girl you'll ever meet! I love this length of fur on her, and it's all thanks to Jeff that it's stayed so healthy and clean. Just a little princess lol.




 

Just your average-everyday-run-of-the-mill-Target-run-car selfie. You know.




 

And as I've been spending so much time alone this week while Jeff works, I've been getting two work outs in every day to get things rolling again. I've felt great and I'm thankful for the sanity it brings me during these evenings alone.




 

Finley Reed misses her dad too, and she looooves when he comes home to visit his girls :)




﻿

 

Sometimes when I go downstairs and see this uniform hanging there, I still find myself in disbelief that my HUSBAND is a trooper. Like, how am I this old first of all? And how did I get so lucky more importantly? I'm still SO proud of him and what he does every day. I love the community we've found in this State Patrol family and I just really feel blessed that our journey in Des Moines brought us here.﻿

 




 

Lastly, here's another car selfie to take us out because I'm just really happy and enjoying life these days. It's nice to be in this ebb and flow and I'm feeling really content where I'm at currently. Sometimes it's nice to have a lack of crazy excitement and get to just "be". It forces me to look around a bit and find happiness and fulfillment right where I am. And that's exactly where I want to be.

About ThreeSixtyFive
Three Sixty Five. Basically; this is a project that I have long been trying to put up; never it had materialized since 2002. Now, I resolve to come up with it this 2013; and this is step 1, putting up the site. Basically, Three Sixty Five is photo blog of something of everything that I come across with daily, every day of the  year. The challenge is to put up a picture post at least once a day, maybe a short write up or thought about it. It could be funny, something on food, people, rides, thoughts, Anything I come across with.
In this day and age of  smartphones with connectivity and uber powerful cameras; there should be no excuse. Three Sixty Five. Anything. Everything. Daily.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
