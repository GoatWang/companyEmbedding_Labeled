Location: Gowling WLG (UK) LLP 4 More London Riverside London SE1 2AU United Kingdom Agenda: To seek approval for the sale of the company's shareholding in Telilea Limited to Numbase Group Limited; and to seek approval for the cancellation of the admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM.


CDialogues plc Proposes Cancellation Of Admission To Trading On AIM
Aug 16 16
CDialogues plc announced that the Company has entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Numbase Group Limited the holding company of Numbase Limited ("Numbase"), the Company's principal customer, for the disposal of all the Company's shares in Telilea Limited (the "Disposal"). Telilea Limited is a trading subsidiary of the Group and is the holding company for the Group's other subsidiaries. Completion of the Disposal will require the approval of Shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules. Following completion of the Disposal, the Company will no longer have any trading operations and the Directors will seek to determine the best method to return the net cash resources of the Company resulting from the Disposal to Shareholders. Following, or as part of, any such distribution to the Shareholders, the Directors propose to engage a liquidator to carry out a members' voluntary liquidation of the Company ("MVL"). Telilea Limited has been purchased by Numbase Group Limited for a price of €840,000 on a cash free, debt free basis. Prior to completion of the Disposal, Telilea Limited will distribute up to €2,896,120 of excess cash to the Company. Given that a liquidation of the Company via an MVL is proposed after completion of the Disposal, the Directors, having considered the guidance to the AIM Rules that is relevant to companies in the situation that will apply to the Company following completion of the Disposal, have also concluded that the admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM should be cancelled ("Cancellation"). A General Meeting of the Company is to be convened to be held at 10 a.m. on 2 September 2016. At the General Meeting, resolutions seeking approval for the Disposal and the Cancellation will be proposed.

Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

LSE:CDOG: Pre-Close Trading Update and Notice of Results
 

Cdialogues25 Jan 2016 07:00:09 CDialogues PLC


RNS Number : 7971M CDialogues PLC 25 January 2016  

 
25 January 2016
 
CDialogues plc
("CDialogues", the "Company" or the "Group")
 
 
Pre-Close Trading Update and Notice of Results
CDialogues plc (AIM: CDOG), the provider of mobile marketing solutions to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), provides a trading update for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015.
 
Further to the announcements made on 17 November 2015 and 18 September 2015, CDialogues reports that revenues for the full year are expected to be approximately €8.8 million (2014: €9.9 million). During 2015, CDialogues operated mobile marketing projects in six countries across the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
 
EBITDA for the period is expected to be approximately €2.0 million (2014: €2.9 million). The EBITDA margin decreased due to lower revenue during the second half of 2015 and the continued investment in business and product development. 
 
Free Cash Flow for the year exceeded €1.4 million (2014: €1.2 million) further enhancing the Company's cash position to €3.6 million as of 31 December 2015 (31.12.2014: €2.4 million). The Group therefore maintains a strong balance sheet to fund future growth.  
 
Outlook
 
Subscription-based recurring revenues, which provide greater scalability and visibility for the business, accounted for more than 75% of the total revenues during 2015 as a whole and therefore provide the Company with a strong basis for the current year. 
 
Furthermore, the Company has identified a pipeline of potential new projects, a number of which are currently undergoing preparations for launch in the coming months. The Board therefore believes that CDialogues should benefit from these during 2016, as the Company adds new capabilities to its product suite and widens its customer footprint.
 
Notice of Results 
 
CDialogues will announce its full year results for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015 on Monday 11 April 2016.
 
Pale Spanos, Chief Executive Officer, commented: "During 2015, the Company continued to develop its operations and remains focused on growing its customer base and geographic reach. Investment in products and new business opportunities ensure that the Company has a strong foundation for growth and new project launches in the coming months."

During the period we focussed on serving our existing clients and ensuring that these projects were well executed.
Whilst our existing client base has remained unchanged during the first quarter of 2016, and we expect revenues from these existing projects to decline during the course of the year, the business remains well placed and well-funded to capitalise on the new business opportunities that may arise this year."

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
The 12-month period to 31 December 2015 was clearly a challenging one.
The period was therefore one of consolidation for the Company as we focused on delivery of existing contracts across geographies where MNO subscriber churn has traditionally been high, due to the fact that mobile phone subscribers typically use pre-pay mobile phone tariffs.
A decision was also made to focus on further product development during the period, and whilst certain project launches were delayed, the company remains confident that its product offerings remain competitive in the marketplace.
Given the disappointing revenue performance, we are able to report that the Company has continued to generate cash during the year and maintain a strong balance sheet as of 31 December 2015.
Reassuringly, our solutions achieved direct results for our existing clients by demonstrably reducing subscriber churn, which helps to underpin the basis of our client relationships. We believe that our continued product investment will result in an improved value proposition, which should also result in further customer loyalty and a reference point for us to generate new business and relationships.
Our first full year on the Alternative Investment Market has been challenging, and we must continue to improve the foundations of the business model. The key to the future is the development of stable new revenue opportunities. The number of MNOs and countries in which we could operate means that there are still plenty of opportunities ahead.
The Board remains focused on improving the business model, whilst preserving the balance sheet and seeking to deliver increased shareholder value, following a disappointing share price performance over the period.

Non-Executive Chairman    
 
 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REVIEW
When we joined the AIM Market in 2014, the focus was on diversifying revenue through multiple client engagements across the Middle East and beyond. As such we invested in both products and personnel to ensure that we are well placed to take advantage of the growing range of global opportunities.
However, as announced during the period, the Company suffered a number of project delays as MNOs pushed back project start dates due to the poor economic environment during 2015. This impacted our second half revenue performance significantly and resulted in lower revenues and EBITDA for the year.
Notwithstanding the poor income performance, cash generation remained strong during the year with free cash flow for the year further enhancing the Company's net cash position to €3.6 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: €2.4 million).
During 2015, CDialogues delivered a total of eight mobile marketing projects in six countries to a total subscriber base of above 20 million customers (2014: 35 million) across the Middle East and Southeast Asia. These projects attracted more than 1.4 million unique subscribers.
Our continued investment on the evolution of our solutions and strategic direction towards a loyalty centric offering has already resulted in an increased interest on our value proposition from potential customers. Further to the Company's prior announcement, it is unfortunate to report that our initial customer in Central America for this proposition faced different challenges on integration that could not be resolved.
I would like to thank our staff and shareholders for their continued support during 2015 as we consolidated our position as one of the leading providers in the space.
 
Outlook
Despite the challenging environment and poor financial performance, we continued to invest in the business whilst maintaining our strong balance sheet and therefore remain well positioned to capitalise on any new opportunities in the regions where we have presence or active business development activities.
Given that net contributions from some mature projects are expected to decrease during 2016, the Company is now focused on building the new business pipeline while maintaining cash generation to preserve our balance sheet during this challenging period for the Company.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER REVIEW 
Revenues for the period fell 12.2% to €8.71m (2014: €9.92m) due to weaker performance in the second half of year from the existing projects and the lack of new project launches. 
Gross profit was down by 35.6% to €2.27m (2014: €3.52m) representing a gross margin of 26.0% (2014: 35.5%). The reduction in gross margin came as a result of reduced revenues and increased costs of our existing projects in the second half of 2015 as well as investment in new project launches. Administration and selling & distribution costs were €1.27m (2014: €0.90) representing 14.6% of revenues (2014:9.0%). 
Operating Profit (after depreciation and amortisation) was down by 62.0% to €1.00m (2014: €2.63m) representing a margin of 11.5% (2014:26.5%). 
Adjusted EBITDA fell by 47.2% to €1.55m (2014: €2.94m) representing a margin of 17.8% (2014:29.6%).
Profit before tax fell by 62.6% to €0.98m (2014: €2.61m) with a margin of 11.2% (2014: 26.3%) while basic earnings per share fell by 64.7% to €0.15 (2014: €0.43).
Operating cash flow remained strong with net cash flows increasing by 47.8% to €2.54m (2014: €1.72m) as a result of efficient working capital management. After taking into account working capital movements and cash flows used in investing activities, which comprise primarily capitalised investment in software development, Free Cash Flow (after development costs and capital expenditure) was €1.49m (2014: €1.22m). 
At the year-end we had accrued income of €1.14m and related accrued expenses of €0.63m which represents income earned during the last months of 2015 (and its associated costs), which has already been invoiced and collected/settled since the year end.
Net cash as of 31 December 2015 was €3.61m (2014: €2.42m) and provides a firm foundation for further growth into new territories. 
As at 31 March 2016, net cash was above €3.5m as a result of the Group's continuing focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet.  This should allow the Group to capitalise on any new business opportunities that may arise this year. 
The Group maintains over 90% of its cash in banks in the United Kingdom and does not generate any revenues in the Greek market.
The Directors do not propose to pay a final dividend for the year-ended 31 December 2015.

STRATEGIC REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
 
The Directors present the Strategic Report of CDialogues Plc for the year ended 31 December 2015.
·      Review of the Business in the year
The Group provides mobile analytics solutions, being offered in the format of marketing loyalty activities that enable brands, mobile network operators and media companies to implement targeted, interactive and measurable loyalty programs by engaging with and entertaining mobile network subscribers via their mobile devices.
The Group has developed internally a technology platform (C/Profiler Software Platform), which is used for the provision of mobile marketing solutions. The Group's technology platform is offered as either a fully managed or as a Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) product.
The core services supported by the Group's platform include the use of any channel that is based on linguistic and text communication such as SMS, MMS, IVR and mobile internet services. Furthermore, the Group's platform supports recurring user subscription and mobile billing services in cooperation with the mobile network operators on either a pre-paid or post-paid basis.
The Group's technical infrastructure is connected directly with Mobile Network Operators in the territories in which it operates and, in most cases, transacts with its business partners through revenue sharing arrangements under which the net revenues generated from the relevant mobile marketing initiatives are divided. In several cases, those mobile marketing initiatives are devised in cooperation with the operators themselves. In other instances, campaigns are instigated by the Group and may be rolled out concurrently across several mobile operator networks and in a number of different countries.
More specifically, through the use of its mobile analytics and linguistic engineering platform, the Group tries to attract as many mobile subscribers to participate in any given service and then seeks to engage and maintain them within the service with relevant content offering and reward programs. To attract potential mobile subscribers, the Group employs promotional seeding techniques which include the use of traditional media and the use of text via mobile or online. Once mobile subscribers are initially attracted, the Group tries to make them engage by providing exciting mobile utilities or providing incentives. The pool of mobile subscribers that eventually engage is analysed and profiled into categories in order for the Group to design the appropriate loyalty building programs and reward schemes.
The ongoing management of mobile marketing solutions provides the Group with a growing database of behavioral and customer engagement analytics. The knowledge and experience on monetization of those data, provides important feedback for the Group's future performance and is also reflected in continuous expansion to the Group's technology platform and evolution of product solutions supported, progressively towards a more loyalty and analytics centric offerings.
The Group is currently focusing its operations on emerging markets. Countries in which it has operated since establishment are Iraq, Vietnam, Ivory Coast, Russia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan, North Cyprus, Guatemala and Oman. It is a Group target to grow market share in existing geographies and also expand its business in other territories.

Group revenue fell by 12.2% from €9.92m in 2014 to €8.71m in 2015. This was due to weaker performance in the second half of year of the existing projects and the lack of new project launches.
Group Adjusted EBITDA for the year fell to €1.55m (2014: €2.94), representing a fall of 47.2%. Free cash flow, after development costs and capital expenditure grew to €1.49m further enhancing the Group's cash position to €3.61m as of 31 December 2015.
 
·      Position of the Company's business at the end of the year
During the period the Group continued to diversify its revenue base both by number of clients and geographical sources of revenue while further strengthening its balance sheet. The Group's statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2015 set out in the table below:

Subscription-based recurring revenues, which provide greater scalability and visibility for the business, accounted for 82 per cent of the total revenues during 2015 as a whole. Notwithstanding the Board's expectation that revenues from existing projects will decline during the course of 2016, the Group's subscription-based recurring revenues are viewed as a key element of the business model.
The Group has identified a pipeline of potential new contracts, a number of which are being actively developed as prospects.
 
 
·      Principal risks and uncertainties facing the business
In addition to the financial risks discussed in Note 29 to the accounts, the Directors set out below the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and a summary of the key measures taken to mitigate those risks:
 
Contract duration and non-renewal of contracts
The Group enters into contracts with its customers which are typically short term in nature (three/four months) but are normally renewed at the end of each term, though this cannot be guaranteed.  The Board seeks to ensure that the Group's relationships with its customers and level of service minimises the risk of contracts not being renewed.
 
Concentration of customer base
The Group is a relatively young business and has not yet achieved a diverse customer base. However, CDialogues has been continually seeking to reduce customer concentration and will continue this aim for 2016.
 
Credit risk
The Group provides services and receives revenues under agreements entered into with a local partner in the territories in which it provides services.  Whilst the Group endeavours to diversify its sources of revenue, it is reliant on this relationship which may result in a greater level of credit risk than if the Group was contracted directly with the MNOs.  However, such credit risk has not affected the business adversely in the past and the Group manages this risk by negotiating and enforcing appropriate contract terms.
 
Countries in which CDialogues operates
CDialogues operates in countries where there may be risks associated with the political or economic environment.  The Group seeks to mitigate these risks by (i) undertaking its own risk analysis of each territory in which it operates; and (ii) operating with local partners with detailed knowledge of the prevailing environment.
 
Attracting and retaining talented staff and motivating key people
The Group has competitive remuneration packages in place to secure the services of talented staff and key employees.
 
Significant failure or interruption to the network or IT Systems
The Group has rigorous controls to maintain and secure its operations, including multi-site back up of key systems. In addition, the Group implements a standardised disaster recovery plan.
 
Failure to keep up to date with fast evolving technology
The Group is constantly developing its software platform ensuring it is evolving in line with the latest technology and in line with its clients' expectations and demands. Management regularly communicates with the Company's clients ensuring the mobile marketing campaigns are meeting their needs.
 
Failure to comply with local laws and regulations
Management mitigate this risk by assessing the regulatory environment and legal system before entering a new market. The Group also implements a strong code of conduct across all of its operations.
In addition to the principal risks and uncertainties above, the Group faces other risks that include but are not limited to:
·      Increased competition
·      Failure to retain, or loss of, customer contracts 
 
Corporate Responsibility
CDialogues Plc takes its responsibilities as a corporate citizen seriously in the territories in which the company operates. The Board's primary goal is to create shareholder value but in a responsible way which serves all stakeholders. Furthermore, CDialogues seeks to continually enhance and extend its contribution to society through the work the Group undertakes with its clients and in areas where the Group decides to operate.
 
Governance
The Board considers sound governance as a critical component of the success of CDialogues and this is given the highest priority. The Group has an effective and engaged Board, with a strong non-executive presence from diverse backgrounds, and well-functioning governance committees. The Audit Committee receives and reviews reports from management and from the Company's auditors. It is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported with particular regard to legal requirements, accounting standards and the AIM Rules. Through the Group's compensation policies and variable components of employee remuneration, the Remuneration Committee of the Board seeks to ensure that the Company's values are reinforced in employee behaviour and that effective risk management is promoted. 
 
Going Concern
 The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through existing cash reserves. The Directors have prepared projected cash flow information for a period of at least twelve months from the date of their approval of the financial statements.  On the basis of this cash flow information, the Directors consider that the company and group will continue to operate without the need for additional financing.  Therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Current Trading
Given that net contributions from some mature projects are expected to decrease during 2016, the Company is now focused on building the new business pipeline while maintaining cash generation to preserve our balance sheet during this challenging period for the Company.

1.    Corporate information
 
The consolidated financial information of Cdialogues Plc and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group") for the year ended 31 December 2015 has been prepared on the basis set out below.
 
Cdialogues Plc (the "Company") was incorporated in England and Wales as a limited liability company in June 2011 and during financial year 2014 as a consequence of its listing on AIM became a public company limited by shares.
2.    Basis of preparation
 
The consolidated financial information of the Group has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for, available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial information is presented in Euros, except when otherwise indicated.
 
The financial information does not constitute the Company's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 but is derived from those financial statements. The statutory financial statements will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The Auditors have reported on those financial statements; their reports were unqualified and did not contain any statements under Companies Act 2006 section 498 (2) or (3).
 
The directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend. 
 
The financial information set out in this announcement was approved and authorised for issue by the board of directors on 8 April 2016.
 
Copies of this financial information will be available on the Company's website.
 
 
3.    Basis of consolidation
 
The consolidated financial information comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
·    Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
·    Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
·    The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
 
·    The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;
·    Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
·    The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights
 
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
 
Profit or loss and each component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
 
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value at the date when control is lost.
4.    Segmental reporting
 
Based on management information there is only one operating segment. The Directors of the Company consider the principal activity of the Group to be that of a provider of Mobile Marketing services.
In this context there is no obligation to prepare and publish financial results by segment, according to the requirements of IFRS 8 "Operating Segments". As far as geographical segment the Group operates mainly (95%) in the area of Middle East and therefore is considered as one geographical segment.

As at 31 December 2015, the Group's tax loss which is available for offset against future taxable profits amounts to €690,942 for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the statement of financial position.
 
The "10% additional charge" was nil (2014 €2,353) and the "Defence contribution" amount of €7 (2014 €491) is related to Telilea Ltd. More specific is the 10% of the year's tax liability as calculated in the tax computation of corporation tax. According to the Cyprus Tax legislation companies have to pay temporary tax on the 75% of their estimated taxable profits for the year otherwise there is a surcharge of 10% on the final tax liability for the year.
 
The Company is obliged to file its tax returns in accordance with the applicable tax law in England and Wales. No income tax is payable on the net income deriving from subsidiaries with foreign operations.
 
The Group's subsidiaries file their tax returns in the countries in which they are established and/or operate. The tax rates at 31 December 2015 of the countries where the operations of the Group are located are the following:
Greece 29.0 %. (2014: 26.0 per cent)
Cyprus 12.5 %. (2014: 12.5 per cent.)
United Arab Emirates.
The income tax is not applicable. Royal Decree of 2002 of the Emirate of Dubai states that the company should be exempt from all taxes including income tax as they operate within the Free Zone.
 
Greek subsidiary (Cdialogues S.A.)
 
Greek tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretations by the tax authorities. Tax returns are filed annually but the profits or losses declared for tax purposes remain provisional until such time, as the tax authorities examine the returns and the records of the taxpayer and a final assessment is issued. Tax losses, to the extent accepted by the tax authorities, can be used to offset profits of the five fiscal years following the fiscal year to which they relate.
 
Tax Compliance certificate
From the financial year 2011 and onwards, all Greek Societe Anonyme and Limited Liability Companies that are required to have their statutory financial statements audited must in addition obtain an "Annual Tax Certificate" as provided for by paragraph 5 of Article 82 of L.2238/1994. This "Annual Tax Certificate" must be issued by the same statutory auditor or audit firm that issues the audit opinion on the statutory financial statements.
 
The tax compliance certificate for the financial year 2014 was concluded by its auditors, based on the provisions of article 65Α L. 4174/2013. No significant additional tax liabilities arose, in excess of those provided for and disclosed in the financial statements.
 
The tax compliance certificate for the financial year 2015 is still in progress based on the provisions of article 65Α L. 4174/2013. No significant additional tax liabilities are expected to arise, in excess of those provided for and disclosed in the financial statements.
 
Cyprus subsidiary (Telilea Ltd)
 
The corporation tax rate is 12.5% (2014:12.5%).
 
Under certain conditions interest income may be subject to defence contribution at the rate of 30% (2014:30%). In such cases this interest will be exempt from corporation tax. In certain cases, dividends received from abroad may be subject to defence contribution at the rate of 17% for 2014 and thereafter.
 
The company has utilised tax relief incentives provided by the Cyprus tax legislation. These incentives allow for special treatment on intellectual property.
The Cyprus tax law on Intellectual Property gives rise to the following tax treatment.
 
·    The cost of the acquisition or development of Intellectual Property of a capital nature is amortised over a period of five years, starting in the year of purchase / development.
·    A statutory reduction of 80% of the profit arising from the use of the Intellectual Property, as well as from any gain on the sale of the Intellectual Property.
·    The 80% deduction applies to profit after deducting any direct expenses including amortisation and interest.
 
 
8.    Earnings per share
 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:
