The Association of Con-servation Engineers (ACE) is an international professional organization of engineers and others in related disciplines   who work with the natural environment and promote the application of sound engineering practices in the field   of natural resource protection and   recreation development. 
Founded on   March 6, 1961, in Washington, D.C., the organ-ization's objective is to bring to-gether the knowledge and   exper-ience of engineers and other per-sonnel employed by   conservation and recreation agencies   and con-sultants who have a community of   specialized interests in the areas of   fish, wildlife, parks, forests and related conservation and recreation fields.

WHAT IS ACE? 

What is Conservation Engineering?    Conservation engineering involves the   creation of outdoor recreation   facilities that everyone can use and enjoy safely. More importantly, conservation engineering ensures that these   facilities blend into the surrounding environment as much as possible in order   to enhance the areas' natural resources. It's a field that requires expertise in   many engineering disciplines, such as construction, structural, hydraulic and   sanitary, to name a few. 
Along with this engineering versatility, conservation engineers must have an understanding of the biological and environmental functions   of the project on which they are   working. They must be able to transform the biological requirements of fish production or wildlife management   into an operating facility; protect and rebuild the past as part of rehabilitating historic structures; and   apply creative thinking and innovative design solutions to construct recreation   facilities in environmentally sensitive areas.

More...Did you know ?On the Infinancials platform, there are two ways to identify the listed peers which most closely resemble a private firm:- with Peer Tracker if you already know a listed peer.Peer Tracker is a patented technology tool for building peer groups using industry classifications. The degree of similarity between two companies is calculated comparing their sector footprints and measured using comparability scores.- with Market Screener if you have no listed peer in mind.Market Screener is a dedicated interface for screening companies using multiple criteria, identifying peers, searching for comparable companies in a specific business sector.About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
