歐盟CE認證申請CE認證的必要性

CE認證為各國產品在歐洲市場進行貿易提供了統一的技術規範，簡化了貿易程式。任何國家的產品要進入歐盟、歐洲自由貿易區必須進行CE認證，在產品上加貼CE標誌。因此CE認證是產品進入歐盟及歐洲貿易自由區國家市場的通行證。
CE認證表示產品已經達到了歐盟指令規定的安全要求;是企業對消費者的一種承諾，增加了消費者對產品的信任程度;
貼有CE標誌的產品將降低在歐洲市場上銷售的風險。這些風險包括：
被海關扣留和查處的風險;
被市場監督機構查處的風險;
被同行出於競爭目的的指控風險。
 
申請CE認證的好處
1.歐盟的法律、法規和協調標準不僅數量多，而且內容十分複雜，因此取得歐盟指定機構幫助是一個既省時、省力，又可減少風險的明智之舉;
　　
2.可以最大程度地獲取消費者和市場監督機構的信任; 　　
3.能有效地預防那些不負責任的指控情況的出現;
