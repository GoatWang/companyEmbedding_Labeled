																												SPAR Group Secures New Joint Venture in China 




Tarrytown, NY - July 26, 2010 - SPAR Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SGRP) (the 
																												"Company" or "SPAR"), a leading supplier of retail merchandising and other 
																												marketing services throughout the United States and internationally, today 
																												announced the structuring of a new Joint Venture in China with its new partner 
																												Shanghai Wedone Marketing Consulting Co., Ltd. The new joint venture will 
																												provide merchandising and marketing services and have national market presence 
																												in the country.





SPAR Group has 
																											been Health Mart's dedicated marketing and merchandising services partner for 
																											the past four years, servicing more than 2,600 Health Mart® stores in all 50 
																											states. Part of the Company's services include consumer product planograms 
																											consisting of new product cut-ins of over 188,000 new items each year, 
																											implementing over 46,000 category resets each year and completing over 30,000 
																											annual visits and over 125,000 in-store hours. 





The new joint 
																											venture will be called SPAR (Shanghai) Marketing Management Company Ltd. and 
																											SPAR will own 51% of the Joint Venture while Shanghai Wedone Marketing 
																											Consulting will own 49% in accordance with the laws of the People's Republic of 
																											China. The new company will provide merchandising and related marketing 
																											services to manufacturers and retailers throughout China.




Shanghai 
																											Wedone Marketing Consulting is a comprehensive marketing management company 
																											that provides brand communication and retail marketing management service in 
																											China. The company works with more than 50 international brands such as 
																											Coca-Cola, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Swatch and several prominent 
																											Chinese brands such as Meng Niu Dairy, Guan Sheng Yuan and Dong-e E-jiao. Their 
																											business covers all tier 1, 2 and 3 cities in China equating to more than 150 
																											cities throughout the country.
"We 
																											are excited to join forces with SPAR to offer a national merchandising and 
																											marketing services group, providing our client manufacturing companies in China 
																											with a strategic advantage in one of the world's largest and fastest growing 
																											consumer markets. Our new venture provides for unlimited opportunities to 
																											capitalize on the growth of the region," stated James Qian, CEO of Shanghai 
																											Wedone Marketing.


Gary 
																											Raymond, President and Chief Executive Officer of SPAR Group, stated, "It is no 
																											secret that China is one of the fastest growing economies and most promising 
																											markets for our marketing and specialty merchandising services. We have 
																											researched diligently to find a synergistic partner to maximize the value of 
																											our presence in China and are pleased to reach an agreement with Shanghai 
																											Wedone. We believe the team at Shanghai Wedone Marketing is the optimal partner 
																											to continue our growth in China." 


Mr. 
																											Raymond continued, "Our strategy internationally has been to partner with 
																											companies that would benefit from our enhanced technology and expertise and 
																											combine that with an experienced local management team. Each subsidiary uses 
																											the same powerful proprietary U.S. based technology allowing logistics, 
																											communication and reporting, translated into their local language. This 
																											strategy remains in line with our objective to increase top line growth while 
																											improving our gross margins and profits. We see tremendous expansion potential 
																											not only in China, but in several other emerging market countries that we hope 
																											to take advantage of in the future."

SPAR Group Completes Successful Product Reset At One of Canada's Largest Retailers
SPAR Group's Innovative Retail Merchandising Technology Saves Canadian Tire Man Hours and Capital
TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Sep 01, 2009 -- SPAR Group, Inc., a leading supplier of retail merchandising and other marketing services throughout the United States and internationally, today announced the successful completion of a major product reset for Canadian Tire, one of Canada's largest retailers.
The product reset consisted of removing and replacing approximately 17,000 items, all in similar packaging, in over 400 stores across Canada. SPAR Group's innovative retail merchandising technology addressed the problem by designing a new specific program to complete the task combined with new planograms for the use of old and new shelving displays. SPAR Group's crews were able to effectively reduce the process from two steps into one, creating significant savings in both man hours and capital for Canadian Tire.
In total, SPAR Group's implementation reduced the time spent on the project by 20%, which translated into significant saving for both Canadian Tires and their primary fastener supplier, ITW.
"When we were  approached by Canadian Tire and their partners, we immediately realized we could use our advanced technology to assist in the re-shelving of the products with significant cost benefits to the client," stated Mr. Larry Deverett, President of SPAR Canada Company. "This project was one of the most productive, fastest and cost effective resets SPAR Group has completed. Previous resets of this type took over 25,000 man hours and we did this one in less than 20,000."
Mr. Gary Raymond, Chief Executive Officer, President and Director of SPAR Group, continued, "We continue to make significant strides in extending our international presence through successful relationships with international market leaders such as Canadian Tire. Management is pleased to see and congratulate the SPAR Group Canada team on their ability to act in an efficient, time effective manner while providing our customer with valuable cost savings and superior service."
