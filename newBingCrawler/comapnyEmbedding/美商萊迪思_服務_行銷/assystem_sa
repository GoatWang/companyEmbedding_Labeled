(ISIN:FR0000074148 - ASY) today announced its consolidated revenue figures for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (first-half 2017).On 11 May 2017, Assystem announced that it had entered into an agreement with Ardian to transfer its outsourced R&D division - Global Product Solutions (GPS) - to a company that will be 60%-owned by Ardian and 40%-owned by Assystem. The transaction is scheduled for completion by end-September 2017.In accordance with IFRS 5, as the agreement provides for Ardian to take over control of GPS, this business has been classified by Assystem as held for sale since 1 January 2017. Consequently, GPS`s revenue is not included in the Group`s consolidated revenue for the first half of 2017, and the first-half 2016 consolidated revenue figure has been restated in order to facilitate year-on-year comparisons. The full amount of GPS`s profit will be recorded under "Profit from discontinued operations" in Assystem`s consolidated financial statements for the period between 1 January 2017 and the date on which its control is transferred. As from that date GPS will be renamed Assystem Technologies Groupe and it will be accounted for by the equity method in Assystem`s consolidated financial statements based on Assystem`s ownership interest in Assystem Technologies Groupe.  First-half 2017 revenue and year-on-year changes* (unaudited)   In millions of euros   H1 2016*   H1 2017   Total year-on-year change   Organic year-on-year change**     Group   191.0   204.5   +7.1%   +5.2%                           Energy & Infrastructure   156.8   175.5   +11.9%   +9.2%     Staffing   29.4   24.3   -17.5%   -17.5%     Other   4.8   4.7   -   -                         * Restated in order to facilitate year-on-year comparisons.   ** Based on a comparable Group structure and constant exchange rates.Based on its new scope of consolidation, the Group`s revenue rose by 7.1% year on year in the first half of 2017, breaking down as 5.2% in organic growth (9.3% excluding the impact of the Staffing business), a 2.4% increase due to changes in scope of consolidation and a 0.5% negative currency effect.ENERGY & INFRASTRUCTURE Revenue generated by the Energy & Infrastructure business advanced 11.9% in the first half of 2017 to €175.5 million and accounted for 86% of total consolidated revenue for the period.
