History[edit]
Genpact began in 1997 as a business unit within General Electric. Its charter was to provide business process services to GE's businesses, with the goal of enabling outstanding efficiencies. During the eight years that followed, Genpact began to manage a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses.
In January 2005, Genpact became an independent company and began to serve clients outside of GE. The company name, Genpact, is designed to convey the business impact it generates for its clients. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'G'. Since then the company has grown from 32,000 employees and revenue of US$823 million, to 77,000+ employees and revenues of US$2.57 billion (2016).
Bain Capital became the firm's largest shareholder in October 2012.
Executive leadership[edit]
On June 17, 2011, NV “Tiger” Tyagarajan[11] became the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Genpact and was appointed to the Board of Directors.[12] He had served as chief operating officer of Genpact. He succeeded Pramod Bhasin, who stepped down as CEO and member of the board and became non-executive vice chairman of the company.[13]
Tyagarajan had been CEO of Genpact from 1999 to 2002, when he led the business through a critical growth phase as a subsidiary of GE.[14] When Genpact became an independent company, he rejoined Genpact from GE Capital U.S. as executive vice president of sales and business development from 2005 to 2009. Thereafter, he took on the role of Genpact’s chief operating officer.

History[edit]
Genpact began in 1997 as a business unit within General Electric. Its charter was to provide business process services to GE's businesses, with the goal of enabling outstanding efficiencies. During the eight years that followed, Genpact began to manage a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses.
In January 2005, Genpact became an independent company and began to serve clients outside of GE. The company name, Genpact, is designed to convey the business impact it generates for its clients. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'G'. Since then the company has grown from 32,000 employees and revenue of US$823 million, to 77,000+ employees and revenues of US$2.57 billion (2016).
Bain Capital became the firm's largest shareholder in October 2012.
Executive leadership[edit]
On June 17, 2011, NV “Tiger” Tyagarajan[11] became the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Genpact and was appointed to the Board of Directors.[12] He had served as chief operating officer of Genpact. He succeeded Pramod Bhasin, who stepped down as CEO and member of the board and became non-executive vice chairman of the company.[13]
Tyagarajan had been CEO of Genpact from 1999 to 2002, when he led the business through a critical growth phase as a subsidiary of GE.[14] When Genpact became an independent company, he rejoined Genpact from GE Capital U.S. as executive vice president of sales and business development from 2005 to 2009. Thereafter, he took on the role of Genpact’s chief operating officer.

Our Collaborative Spirit for Partnerships and Innovation


 



Despite our growth, we are not a disproportionately large organization. Unlike some of our competitors, we retain a unique flexibility and collaborative spirit focused on our individual clients served by an attentive leadership, and the ability to bring together teams from various parts of the organization (consulting, process operations, technology, and analytics).

Similarly, our approach to innovation  is rooted in our ability to continuously observe the needs of real operations, as well as our openness to external partners – thanks to a vibrant incubation and alliance program managed from Silicon Valley.

History[edit]
Genpact began in 1997 as a business unit within General Electric. Its charter was to provide business process services to GE's businesses, with the goal of enabling outstanding efficiencies. During the eight years that followed, Genpact began to manage a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses.
In January 2005, Genpact became an independent company and began to serve clients outside of GE. The company name, Genpact, is designed to convey the business impact it generates for its clients. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'G'. Since then the company has grown from 32,000 employees and revenue of US$823 million, to 77,000+ employees and revenues of US$2.57 billion (2016).
Bain Capital became the firm's largest shareholder in October 2012.
Executive leadership[edit]
On June 17, 2011, NV “Tiger” Tyagarajan[11] became the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Genpact and was appointed to the Board of Directors.[12] He had served as chief operating officer of Genpact. He succeeded Pramod Bhasin, who stepped down as CEO and member of the board and became non-executive vice chairman of the company.[13]
Tyagarajan had been CEO of Genpact from 1999 to 2002, when he led the business through a critical growth phase as a subsidiary of GE.[14] When Genpact became an independent company, he rejoined Genpact from GE Capital U.S. as executive vice president of sales and business development from 2005 to 2009. Thereafter, he took on the role of Genpact’s chief operating officer.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Genpact Acquires OnSource For Claims Inspection Tech - Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Genpact Acquires OnSource For Claims Inspection TechAug. 3.17 | About: Genpact Limited (G) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryBPO firm Genpact has acquired OnSource for an undisclosed amount.OnSource has developed a mobile-first claims inspection system that improves claims processing efficiency for insurance companies.Genpact gains another capability for its end-to-end claims management offerings to the insurance industry.



 Quick Take Business outsourcing company Genpact Limited (G) has acquired insurance claim processing firm OnSource for an undisclosed sum. OnSource has developed a claims inspection system that utilizes self-service, mobile apps or on demand mobile inspectors to capture and document property damage. Genpact will fold OnSource’s application into its AI-driven Cora platform to provide a broader set of offerings to prospects and customers in the insurance vertical. Target Company Braintree, Massachusetts-based OnSource was founded in 2011 as a provider of Inspection-as-a-Service primarily for property and casualty insurance carriers and their customers. Management is headed by founder and CEO Tim Schneider, who was previously founder of Pro-Survey Solutions And Vice President of Product Management at Agero, both of operated in the claims management space. Below is a brief overview video about OnSource’s YouInspect system:  (Source: OnSource) Its inspection platform is relevant for four inspection types: Vehicle, Property, Scene and Other The company provides three separate products:  On Demand Field Service Self Service Instant Inspection 
 Acquisition Terms and Rationale Neither company disclosed the transaction amount or terms. Genpact did not file an 8-K for the deal and did not indicate any change in guidance as a result of the transaction, so it appears that the amount paid was not material to Genpact’s financial condition. Given Genpact is a nearly $6 billion market cap company, it likely paid less than $50 million for the deal. As of Genpact’s most recent results, it had $441 million in cash and equivalents and $1.98 billion in total liabilities. Genpact is in the middle of a transformation from a BPO firm to a value-added AI-driven firm, of which the recent launch of its Cora platform is the latest evidence. Its acquisition of OnSource’s Inspection-as-a-Service [IaaS] will be folded into the Cora system will provide additional capabilities to Genpact’s claims management system and ‘will allow carriers to seamlessly write accurate estimates and manage supplements in a much quicker and more collaborative manner, resulting in significantly higher customer satisfaction.’ As part of Genpact, OnSource’s system will therefore be marketed to Genpact’s existing customer bases as well as providing an added offering to sell to prospective customers. As Tim Schneider, CEO of OnSource stated in the deal announcement, With Genpact's comprehensive claims management capabilities, we are excited to join the team to deploy our products for many more insurance carriers. We know that the industry is ready for these capabilities, and the traction of our digital inspection product proves that it drives significant efficiencies for carriers and exceeds customer expectations in the claims and pre-insurance inspection processes. Assuming Genpact didn’t overpay for the deal, the addition of OnSource’s mobile-first system will build on its end-to-end claims processing value proposition for the insurance vertical. I view the acquisition as a positive for Genpact in the medium-term. I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

Today no industry can exist without the assistance of the service industry. It has become an essential part of our everyday life. Service industry generally thrives on the needs of the people. The most important factor in the services is of the quality and the delivery time used by the service providers.
