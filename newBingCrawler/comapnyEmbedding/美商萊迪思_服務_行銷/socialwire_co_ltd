CROSSCOOP ANNOUNCES OPENING OF SINGAPORE OFFICE TO SERVE JAPANESE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES




― A new development platform providing office facilities, human capital, deals support, and market intelligence for businesses expanding overseas ―



Japanese incubator and serviced office CROSSCOOP has opened its first office in Singapore as CROSS COOP SINGAPORE PTE.LTD, located at 10F, 80 Robinson Road, Singapore as of 1st July 2011. The office has the capacity to host up to 50 companies and 170 staff, and is the first Japanese serviced office to open its doors in Singapore. 

■Singapore serviced office establishment’s background
“While China and other ASEAN countries have maintained high growth during the current economic cycle”, says CROSSCOOP director, Motofumi Shoji, “Japan has long faced pressure from a shrinking labor market and an aging population, among other country risks.  These challenges are driving more and more Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to expand business overseas”. 

　Among the entry barriers faced by many Japanese SMEs are a lack of knowledge of local laws, regulations and industry information; difficulties conducting in-depth market research; and challenges in communicating and maintaining good relationships with local partners.

CROSSCOOP SINGAPORE is supported by a wide range of influential and resourceful partners, including the Singaporean government, government-affiliated investing companies, financial institutions, and recruiting and accounting firms. It is the first Japanese serviced office in Singapore and intended to be a one-stop development platform providing office facilities, human capital, deals support, and market intelligence for its clients while expanding their business to Asian markets. The company plans regular networking events and seminars aimed at supporting the growth of its clients.
