Company Overview

From a peer analysis angle, relative underperformance over the last year has improved more recently.


It trades at a lower Price/Book multiple (1.50) than its peer median (2.66).


The market expects CAI-IT to grow at about the same rate as the peers and to maintain the median returns it currently generates.


CAI-IT‘s relative asset efficiency and net profit margins are both around the median level.


Change in the company’s annual revenues seems to be coming at the expense of earnings.


Over the last five years, CAI-IT‘s return on assets has declined from above median to about median among its peers, indicating declining relative operating performance.


The company’s relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.


While CAI-IT‘s revenues in recent years have grown faster than the peer median, the market gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median suggesting that the market has some questions about the company’s long-term strategy.


The company’s level of capital investment seems appropriate to support the company’s growth.


CAI-IT seems to be constrained by the current level of debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
CAI-IT is debt-constrained.

With debt at a relatively high 52.69% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 32.00%), and interest coverage level of 3.33x, CAI-IT seems debt-constrained.


All 5 peers for the company have an outstanding debt balance.

CAI-IT has moved to a Some Capacity from a Constrained profile at the prior year-end.

CAI-IT‘s interest coverage has increased 2.71 points from last year’s low but is still below its four-year average interest coverage of 502.99.


The increase in its interest coverage to 3.33x from 0.62x (in 2015) was also accompanied by an increase in its peer median during this period to 1.45x from -0.98x.


CAI-IT‘s debt-EV is its highest over the last four years and compares to a low of 0% in 2013.


Like the interest coverage trend, the increase in its debt-EV (to 52.69% from 7.93%) was also accompanied by an increase in its peer median during this period (to 32.00% from 13.26%).


Relative to peers, debt-EV rose 26.02 percentage points (and is now higher than its peer median).

COMUNICATO STAMPA


PRESS RELEASE


BIOERA S.p.A.


Opening of the new Unopiù store in central Madrid

* * *
     Milano, May 8 2015 - Bioera S.p.A. ('Bioera' o 'the Company') acknowledges that Unopiù's corporate turnaround will start from Madrid, with the opening of a brand new showroom in Calle Lagasca 73, one of the most prestigious locations of the city. The new showroom is of approximately
     600 sq.m and was officially inaugurated yesterday evening. The event was attended by authorities,
     journalists, architects, and opinion leaders. Among the guests, also the Italian ambassador in Spain, Dr. Pietro Sebastiani, was present at this event.
     Unopiù's presence in the Iberian Peninsula starts in 1999 with a store on the outskirts of Barcelona followed by another on the outskirts of Madrid and a franchisee in Seville. In accordance with the strategic guidelines shared with the new owner, a joint venture named 'Splendor Investment Holdings' held
     50% by Bioera, 25% by Yaks Holding and 25% by Bramfield Limited, Unopiù takes this important first step with the objective of restoring the deserved brand image and raise its brand positioning.

'The store on the outskirts was not up to the standard of a high-end company that has been, for many years, the European landmark for outdoor furniture', said Marco Dolcino, CEO of Unopiù.'The new owner, in full agreement with management, wants a deserved high positioning of the brand Unopiù, bringing it closer to style and quality contents that characterize fashion brands. We are extremely happy to take this first step in an exclusive and luxury-dedicated neighborhood in the heart of one of the main European capitals. Near us there are stores like Armani, Chanel, Hermès as well as important banks, offices, embassies and palaces of great value. It's the right location for Unopiù and it's the kind of neighborhood in which we will try to open all of our future stores', adds Dolcino.'It's a first step as well as an important investment for us. We have great expectations and we hope that the Spanish public will appreciate Unopiù. Also, the next step will be moving the shop in Barcelona from the outskirts to the heart of the city. Nonetheless, we are proud that Unopiù's 'flag' waves in such a prestigious country'.


The new Unopiù flagship store is designed by Martino Berghinz and will be the format for future investments in major world capitals; the one in Calle Lagasca is in one of the best neighborhoods of the city. Spanish customers, always lover of the outdoors and therefore of outdoor furnishings, will find in Unopiù every solution to suit their own needs and tastes.
       Unopiù has a total of 29 direct stores in Europe: 14 in Italy, 8 in France, 5 in Germany and 2 in Spain.
