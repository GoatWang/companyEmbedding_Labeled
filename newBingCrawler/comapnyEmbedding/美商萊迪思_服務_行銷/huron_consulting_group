The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Huron Consulting Group in October 2014.InterviewI submitted my resume through the posting on my college's recruiting site. One week later, I was notified I was selected for an interview on my college campus for the next week (2 weeks after my initial application). The night before the interview was an informal meet-and-greet to ask questions of the recruiters (about 4 came into town). The next day I had about a 40-minute interview that was mostly based on my personality and experience.The night of the interview, I received an email inviting me back for the second round of on-campus interviews the next day. This was a 2-hour process with 4 steps:1) write a SQL command given certain criteria2) compute a ratio given certain accounting data3) interview about my technical skills with a manager4) interview about my personality and problem solving skillsInterview Questions When was a time you coordinated the efforts of a group to accomplish a complex task   Answer Question Huron Consulting Group 2014-10-11 11:03 PDTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Huron Consulting Group Response seconds agoEdit • DeleteOther Interview Reviews for Huron Consulting Group 6 May 2014   Product Specialist Interview Anonymous Interview Candidate in Lake Oswego, OR (US)No OfferPositive ExperienceDifficult InterviewApplicationI applied through college or university.

The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Huron Consulting Group.InterviewThe interview process with Huron was fairly long. I was reached by one of their recruiters early December 2013 to see if I was interested in the position. Basic stuff here really, are you familiar with SQL, would be willing to relocate, etc. I then got a second call to set up a more in depth phone interview. This included 2 parts, a behavioral interview and a technical interview.The behavioral interview had questions like, name me a moment where you went above and beyond for your employer, what is a weakness of yours, tell me a bit about yourself.The technical interview was focused more on my knowledge of IT systems. Can you describe to me what a LAN is, describe to me 1st, 2nd, 3rd normal form, name me some SQL statements.After that if they are still interested they will set up on on-site interview. This interview consists of 4 parts - A case question, a company overview, lunch "interview", and closing interview.The case question I got was about an ER room and it's efficiency, how to come up with a solution, what to look for, etc. They also will give you a pretty basic math problem to do.Company overview was basically just a description of the different units in the company, where your role will be, how they function, etc. Expect a brain teaser and an SQL question here (a basic one, like a join query or something)Lunch interview is an opportunity for you to meet 2 employees and ask them any questions about the company, it wasn't them asking the questions, it is you, so take this opportunity to learn as much as possible.Closing interview is where I was asked to kind of go through my resume, tell him why I think I'm a good fit, what makes me interested in the position, how comfortable am I with what I've learned today etc.Really the on-site interview is them looking for a good cultural fit.The entire process took about a month.Interview Questions What is a RAID and why is it useful.   2 AnswersReasons for DecliningGot a better job offer somewhere else closer to where I Want to be, this one is a close runner up though.

It took me about a month to get through 3 phone interviews and then they flew me out for the final interview. The first 3 interviews were basic interview hr and tech questions about your past experience in the tech industry and dealing with customer support. The last onsite interview was broken down into 4 sections. First, was the Case Interview. Here I was given a problem and asked how I would solve it. The problem was that the ER of a hospital was having issues with their customers having to wait to long before being seen. The second interview was the Project Tools Overview. This interview was a basic description of the teams and software used at Huron. During this interview I was asked to create an easy join query and solve a brain teaser question. The third interview was a lunch interview. The last interview is with the Director of Product Implementation to find out if I would be a good fit within the company.Interview Questions Brainteaser: there are two rooms, in one room you have four switches and in the other room you have four light bulbs. How do you figure out which light bulb is connected to which switch.   1 Answer Huron Consulting Group 2014-02-04 12:39 PSTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Huron Consulting Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete 12 Nov 2012 Helpful (1)   Product Specialist Interview Anonymous Interview Candidate in Lake Oswego, OR (US)Declined OfferPositive ExperienceEasy InterviewApplicationI applied through college or university. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Huron Consulting Group (Lake Oswego, OR (US)) in October 2012.InterviewHuron is a very pleasant company. I interviewed in the Lake Oswego branch. I had one interview in the morning on basic business tools with one thought question. Then I was taken out to lunch with two employees that I would potentially work with who were also in product specialist roles. My last interview was with senior management. Overall, the interviews were very understandable and they showed a genuine desire to understand my interests and abilities.

The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Huron Consulting Group.InterviewA month long interview process with roughly 8 hours of questioning. It's astounding how poorly they execute these. Who decided that it would be a great idea to have 2, 3 hr interviews in-order to find the ideal candidate? If this was the Pentagon, or heck - Google I understand.. but for a firm that isn't even ranked on the top 50 companies to work for? Really?Also the recruiter has an attitude problem. She definitely gave me an odd holier than thou attitude when I approached her for questions/concerns. She is supposed to channel the exuberance of company about a candidate; not give vague answers that instill uncertainty in both.So imagine then, if you will a company that considers a month long process the de facto standard for their hiring process for this role. Then imagine if you were indeed hired, how long would it take to get your message across to upper management and how soon it would be heard. Seems to exhibit a constant up hill struggle in places there shouldn't be.Interview Questions None. Just be yourself.   Answer Question Huron Consulting Group 2012-10-12 14:26 PDTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Huron Consulting Group Response seconds agoEdit • DeleteInter­views > Product Specialist > Huron Consulting GroupRSS Feed RSS FeedEmbed iconEmbedDon't Miss Out On a Job You LoveUpload a CV to easily apply to jobs from anywhere.

Young and fun start-up environment that emphasizes good team culture. Competitive salary, benefits, and generous PTO policyConsThis is a consulting company first and technology company second. Terrible work/life balance with consultants calling analysts at all hours of the morning and night. No technical career advancement after Associate with no career paths other than corporate management. Too many managers and directors that do not act with integrity (good employees from all types of positions were fired for not toeing the line). Constant fear of being blamed for even the smallest of problems if a consultant or client reported issues. Roles weren't clearly defined and so you may do multiple things from a traditional BSA role to a developer/QA and client relationship owner all at the same time. Legacy software is incredibly outdated (1990s) and utilizes old code that has never been updated consistently across all clients. No effort made to standardize anything from a technical standpoint. Knowledge management is severely lacking (internal wiki is a joke). Software development processes lacking as a whole without proper development team or industry development best practices. Consultants drive all work and don't care about following proper development protocol. Company bends over for clients by incurring technical debt which is never repaid and leads to massive problems for clients in the long run resulting in extreme overhead.Advice to ManagementFollow proper industry software development and provide clear career paths for individuals who do not want to go into management.

Don't promise anything you can't keep and also please treat your employer as human being rather than resources.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Huron Consulting Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Huron Consulting Group 2013-03-06 16:53 PST 17 Aug, 2012 Helpful (7)"Bright people, focus on training, good place for recent grads"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Product Specialist in Lake Oswego, OR (US)Current Employee - Product Specialist in Lake Oswego, OR (US)Doesn't RecommendNegative OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Huron Consulting Group full-time (More than 3 years)ProsThe staff includes some bright and committed people, ongoing training is a priority and taken seriouslyConsHeavy hierarchy of management, everyone is a supervisor, which creates an environment of micro management and overly critical reviews (eg. specific verbiage used on the phone is critiqued). Hard headed management has the "with us or against us" attitude. Good people leave with no counter offer.Advice to ManagementReduce the levels of management...teams of 8 don't need 3 supervisors. Stop focusing on 15 min increments of billable time, it creates too much overhead. Treat experienced hires as such, they don't need to trained and monitored like 22 year old recent college graduates.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Huron Consulting Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Huron Consulting Group 2012-08-17 08:40 PDTReviews > Product Specialist > Huron Consulting Group RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleAssociate (67) Analyst (58) Manager (46) Director (29) Healthcare Analyst (13) Associate Consultant (10) Managing Director (6) Consulting Analyst (6) Project Manager (6) Healthcare Manager (5) Contract Attorney (5) Consultant (5) Product Specialist (4) Document Review Attorney (4) Healthcare Associate (4) Show MoreShow LessCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to ExploreHuron Consulting Group PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedNavigant ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 499 ReviewsDeloitte ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 18,758 ReviewsFTI Consulting ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 549 ReviewsBain & Company ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,648 ReviewsEY ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 14,111 ReviewsPwC ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 14,578 ReviewsMcKinsey & Company ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 2,336 ReviewsThe Advisory Board Company ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 765 ReviewsL.E.K.
