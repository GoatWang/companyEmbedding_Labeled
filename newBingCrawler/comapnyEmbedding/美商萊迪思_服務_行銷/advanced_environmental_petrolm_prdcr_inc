Did you not notice the upward trend on the share price of Advanced Environmental Petrolm Prdcr Inc (OTCMKTS:AEPP) commenced at the end of June? Not many people in Wall Street got to know it, because the volume shown was very light. In addition, the press release, which we believe caused the market move, was not put out on every website. On Yahoo Finance, for example, nobody could find it. It was this hidden document that the company released here, which caused the share price spike. This is exclusive information from us. Do you want to know what is it about? Keep reading after you note the 300% return that AEPP returned in less than five days. We will explain what happened.

Business – What did go wrong?

Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers, Inc. (AEPP) was founded in Florida in June 2013. In an initial phase, the company provided consultancy services to the electric vehicle research and technologies industry, but the business objective was expanded in 2015. The company commenced “energy operations through a planned acquisition of exploration properties in Peru“, which recently turned to be a bad business.
The acquisition of Peruvian exploration properties was unfortunately terminated, as the terms of the acquisition were not fulfilled. This is from one of the documents released by the company:
“During February 2017, the planned acquisition of the Peruvian exploration properties was terminated because of the failure to complete the terms of the acquisition. Immediately following this termination, AEPP had limited or no operating activities and no tangible assets, but had significant liabilities.” Source
How did the company react to the failure? Management was quite fast. It rapidly decided to exchange the common stock for outstanding debt to reduce the liabilities of the company. This was completely necessary in order to commence a new activity.
“On March 1, 2017, Interim Management was issued 60,000,000 shares of common stock to pay, acquire or reach agreement with AEPP’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of AEPP and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations, including any fees for services rendered.” Source
The company found a new activity and a new partner soon. On March 6, 2017, Oncolix, Inc., a Houston-based clinical-stage biotechnology company, acquired all the common stock owned by the management. This is what we found hidden in one of the documents released by the company. The change of control was announced on April 6, 2017:
“On April 6, 2017, Interim Management completed the sale 61,465,130 shares of common stock to Oncolix. Interim Management resigned all positions with the Company, and two officers of Oncolix were appointed as the sole Directors of AEPP, resulting in a change in control of AEPP.” Source
It seems that Oncolix will merge with AEPP, but this potential buyer has not announced anything yet. The market reacted by pushing up the share price when Oncolix appeared in April, later in May and June, the share price remained quiet and calm until this document was released on June 28, 2017.
The new announcements that caused the spike: listing on a more-established trading venue and reverse merger
In the document that was released to the market in this corporate website, the following words were found of Michael T Redman, Chairman of the Board.
“We have no current plans to effect a forward or reverse split of AEPP’s common stock. We will continue to evaluate the establishment of new operations with the goal to attract external financing and allow us to ultimately seek listing on a more-established trading venue, which we believe is in the best interest of our stockholders.” Source
In our opinion, the market celebrated that the chairman will not effect a reverse split, rather he plans to list the shares on a better exchange. The stock split does not generally help stockholders. It is an artificial modification of the share price that is usually not appreciated by the market and tends to erode shareholders’ value. It is a great news that the company will not do it. Additionally, if the shares are listed on a better exchange, such as the NASDAQ, or the NYSE, many more market participants will check the share price. Consequently, demand for the stock may increase and the share price could raise. Be alert on this type of news either by visiting the company’s website or subscribing to our newsletter.
In addition, the chairman said the following:
“We continue to evaluate options which we consider to be in the best interest of AEPP’s stockholders. These options include an offer to the stockholders of Oncolix to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Oncolix and merge the two companies. In consultation with our legal, tax and financial advisers, we intend to finalize the terms and conditions of such offer during July 2017. Of course, there can be no assurance that such terms and conditions with be acceptable to the stockholders of Oncolix.” Source
Hence, the company may be preparing an offer to merge Oncolix and AEPP. That is what excited the market participants recently. In addition, the fact that the contract may be put out in July increased the market expectation. For both companies, a reverse merger could be great. AEPP will be running again an activity and will obtain assets, and Oncolix will obtain access to the financial markets. Is that a good deal for Oncolix? Yes, absolutely; being public means that companies can obtain better financing.
Conclusion
The beginning of 2017 was terrible for AEPP stockholders. The company could not finish the acquisition in Peru, and it ceased its operations. Consequently, management exited the company and it was sold to debt holders. It was a disaster and the share price collapsed.
Things have changed recently showing what we always say: “the market always overreacts to bad news.” The company was sold to another partner, Oncolix, Inc., which is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The corporate move was celebrated by the market and the share price was pushed up in May and April. Most recently, we could find in a new document that the company is planning to merge the two companies. The press release about the deal is expected to be published this month. Be alert on that news, since it may be very beneficial for the share price. Subscribe to our newsletter if you need rapid information.

VP’s, engineers, government figures and CEO’s unite to offer the strongest message, that the heavy oil segment is a vital and resurgent strand of the international energy mix.
The highlights
At a key poster meeting during the initial days of the sessions this year, Nigel Bosworth, Advanced Environmental’ s Chief Technology Officer, highlighted GAP-Canada’s new breakthrough technology LC, the environmentally friendly liquid catalyst. The company has the right of first denial to apply this know-how.
Attendees were surprised by the ability of the know-how to recuperate heavy oil without pressure or heat and lower operating costs and capital radically. The presentation at WHOC has led in a myriad of conferences and growth proposals with the company, which showcase the Liquid Catalyst’s skill to lower expenses in current projects.

Additionally, the company has an alternative to commence exploring more than 3 million acres of its Peruvian Resources. The know-how they are advancing combined with the prospect of a considerable oil reserve, is lead of one of the largest exploration assignments in South America. In the month of July, the company reported that it has agreed to the terms with the creditors resulting in the firm being debt free.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On June 28, 2017, Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers, Inc. (the
"Company") issued a press release announcing an update of its corporate
activities. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this
Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference in this Item 7.01.
The information set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the press
release attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 99.1 is "furnished" and shall
not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of
that Section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in
any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, whether made before or after the date hereof
and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings, except as
shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Item
7.01 on Form 8-K and the press release attached to this Current Report will not
be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information in the Current
Report that is required to be disclosed solely by Regulation FD.
Forward-looking statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K and the press release above may contain
forward­looking statements about the business, financial condition and prospects
of the Company. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "projects," "expects," "may,"
"goal," "estimates," "should," "plans," "targets," "intends," "could," or
"anticipates," or the negative thereof, or other variations thereon, or
comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy or objectives.
Forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities,
trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that
have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in the press release include, without
limitation, the plans and intentions of the Company regarding its trading venue,
its intention to raise additional capital, its acquisition of operations, and
other matters.
Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in forward-looking
statements are reasonable, there can be no assurances that such expectations
will prove to be accurate. Security holders are cautioned that such
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking
statements contained in the press release speak only as of the date of the press
release, and the Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to
report any updates or revisions to any such statement to reflect any change in
the Company's expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances
on which any such statement is based. Certain factors may cause results to
differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made in the
press release. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in our
Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings with the SEC, which can be
electronically accessed from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov/.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Big Changes Afoot at Advanced Environmental Petrolm Prdcr Inc (OTCMKTS:AEPP)

Advanced Environmental Petrolm Prdcr Inc (OTCMKTS:AEPP) is a micro-cap stock that has started to garner attention as the stock launches up the chart in recent action. We’ve seen no press releases and no clear narrative emerge. However, the company has put out a couple of filings that may clarify the picture a bit. We will cover them below, but the picture we get suggests a major transition into a new entity.
As for the action itself, traders will note nearly 670% during the past month in terms of shareholder gains in the company, but this action is running counter to the larger trend in the name. Market participants may want to pay attention to this stock. AEPP is a stock who’s past is littered with sudden rips. What’s more, the company has benefitted from a jump in recent trading volume to the tune of exceeding 600% over the long run average. This is particularly important due to the relatively small float size in the stock (roughly 28M shares). One is wise to respect the dynamic this may create — a mechanically driven price squeeze can result from this type of mix of small float and ramping attention from traders.
Advanced Environmental Petrolm Prdcr Inc (OTCMKTS:AEPP) has framed itself as a public Oil & Gas company trading on the OTC-QB market. The company develops an advanced environmental process for extracting Oil & Gas resources with the goal of minimal damage to the environment.
According to the company’s prior materials, the process allows it to reinstate the ground as it develops to leave minimal to no scarring. The processed areas are converted into engineered farmland for the local communities. Over the past eight (8) years, PSP (Pointsource Processing) has spent in excess of USD$3 million in qualifying the natural resource deposit and is in the process to obtain a third party engineering report which estimates the proven resources of Oil & Gas.
According to most recent press materials from 3 months back, “AEPP will become an oil and gas exploration and development company, operating in Peru where it has a number of targets in the highly prospective Block 19 of the southern region of that country. The Company will hold an exclusive license, which entitles it to explore and develop certain oil and gas properties known as “Block 19,” an area of 10,100 square km.”

As for clarifying the narrative on the recent move, we would note the company’s two recent filings. First, on March 8, 2017, the company filed a Schedule 14F-1 Information Statement, which is generally part of the process of changing the majority of the Board. This was followed by an 8K on March 14, 2017.
Reading into the documents, this looks like a wholesale change of the company into a different entity achieved via a 66% majority ownership change through a stock purchase agreement.
To wit: the stipulation notes that the company’s current lone employee, executive officer, director and Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, Brian K. Kistler, shall resign all such positions with the Company immediately following the new Board’s appointment of Michael T. Redman as a director to the Board and Chief Executive Officer, President, Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as well as one J. Donald Payne as a director to the Board and Secretary and Chief Accounting Officer.
Mr. Redman is currently the Chief Executive Officer, President and a Director and Mr. Payne is the Senior Vice President – Finance and Administration and Secretary of the Purchaser, Oncolix, Inc.
So, long story short, as near as we can tell, AEPP is becoming Oncolix, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Houston, Texas. The company is developing Prolanta, a targeted therapeutic protein for the treatment of ovarian, breast and other cancers. Prolanta is an antagonist of the human prolactin receptor, blocking the effects of human prolactin.  “There is substantial scientific evidence that human prolactin is associated with the growth of certain cancers as well as resistance of cancers to platinum and taxane therapies.  By blocking the effects of prolactin, Prolanta™ has demonstrated a high level of efficacy in ovarian and breast cancer models, and is also expected to be effective in models of other cancers.”
We will get more clarity on things, no doubt, in coming days and weeks.
As it stands, earning a current market cap value of $2.2M, AEPP has virtually no cash on the books, which stands against about $285K total current liabilities. The company is pre-revenue at this point. We will update the story again soon as developments transpire.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On July 25, 2017, Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers, Inc. (the
"Company" or "AEPP") and Oncolix, Inc. ("Oncolix") amended the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Merger") for the acquisition by AEPP of all the outstanding
securities of Oncolix, a private clinical-stage biotechnology company developing
Prolanta™ for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The amendment reduced the
obligation of AEPP after the closing of the Merger to increase its number of
authorized shares of common stock to an amount no less than 950 million shares.
The current number of authorized shares of AEPP common stock is 500 million
shares. AEPP and Oncolix believe that this amended number of authorized shares
allows sufficient flexibility for its operating and financial activities after
the Merger.
The Merger is subject to certain conditions to closing. There can be no
assurances that the Merger will close. The Amendment to the Agreement and Plan
of Merger is enclosed as Exhibit 2.02 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The closing of the Merger is subject to closing conditions.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal
Year
See Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K for proposed changes to the
Articles of Incorporation of the Company.



Forward-looking statements



This Current Report on Form 8-K and the press release above may contain
forward­looking statements about the business, financial condition and prospects
of the Company. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "projects," "expects," "may,"
"goal," "estimates," "should," "plans," "targets," "intends," "could," or
"anticipates," or the negative thereof, or other variations thereon, or
comparable terminology, by discussions of strategy or objectives, as well as to
whether any merger transaction will close, and the final terms of the merger
including approximate issuance of Company capital stock in any such transaction,
as such issuances are subject to adjustment based on the trading price of the
Company common stock post-closing. Forward-looking statements relate to
anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because
forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these
statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements in the press release include, without limitation, the specific terms,
plans and intentions of the Company regarding its agreement with the
stockholders and debtholders of Oncolix, the uncertainty regarding the closing
of any transaction, the availability of financing for such transaction and the
future operations of the Company, and other matters.
Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in forward-looking
statements are reasonable, there can be no assurances that such expectations
will prove to be accurate or that the Company will close any transaction with
the Oncolix shareholders (whether on the terms set forth therein or any other
terms). Security holders are cautioned that such forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements contained in the
press release speak only as of the date of the press release, and the Company
expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to report any updates or
revisions to any such statement to reflect any change in the Company's
expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any
such statement is based. Certain factors may cause results to differ materially
from those anticipated by some of the statements made in the press release.
Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in our Forms 10-K, 10-Q,
8-K and other filings with the SEC, which can be electronically accessed from
the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov/.
