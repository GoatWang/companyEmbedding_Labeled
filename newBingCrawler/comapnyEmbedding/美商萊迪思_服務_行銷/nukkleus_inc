	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS



	 



	Note 1.  The Company History and Nature of the
	Business 



	 




	Nukkleus Inc. (formerly Compliance & Risk Management Solutions
	Inc.) (the “Company”) was formed on July 29, 2013 in the State of Delaware as a for-profit Company and established
	a fiscal year end of September 30.   On February 25, 2015, John Nettlefold closed a transaction in which he purchased
	a total of 3,500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, representing 88% of the shares in the Company from Mountain
	Laurel Holdings. At the same time, Mr. Christopher Neuert, the former Director resigned his position at that time and the shareholders
	of the Company elected Mr. Nettlefold as Director of the Company.


	 


	Subsequent to the change in control on February 25, 2015, the
	new Director John Nettlefold decided to transition the company from business technology to advertising technology. To this effect,
	on May 22, 2015, Mr. Nettlefold undertook a Merger between Nukkleus Inc., a Nevada entity and Compliance Risk & Management
	Solutions, Inc., a Delaware entity & former name of this Company


	 


	On July 2, 2015 the State of Delaware approved an Amendment
	of the Articles to increase the Authorized shares of the Company to 300,000,000. On July 6, 2015, the state of Delaware approved
	the forward stock split at the ratio of 39.37:1. FINRA gave final approval for this forward stock split, name change and ticker
	symbol change from CRMV to the current NUKK on July 24, 2015.


	 


	By late July, management had decided that many of the underlying
	factors of Mr. Nettlefold’s business would not be feasible as presented. As such, on July 26, 2015, the previous Merger Agreement
	was rescinded.


	 


	On July 27, 2015, Charms Investments, Inc. closed a transaction
	in which it acquired the majority restricted block from the Director John Nettlefold, representing 88% of the company’s shares,
	as seen on the 8K filed July 27, 2015.


	 


	On August 17, 2015, Mr. Nettlefold resigned as Director of the
	Company, and on the same day the majority of the shareholders elected Mr. Peter Maddocks as Director of the Company.  Since
	this transition, the Company has been conducting due diligence and reviewing several possibilities within the technology arena.


	 


	On February 5, 2016, Charms Investments, Ltd, a non-affiliated
	company, sold 146,535,140 shares of common stock to Currency Mountain Holdings Bermuda, Limited (“CMH”), the parent
	of the Company. CMH is wholly-owned by an entity that is owned by the Company’s sole officer and director. In addition, on
	the same date, CMH acquired 3,937,000 shares of common stock from another non-affiliated company.    The aggregate
	purchase price paid by CMH was $347,500. 


	 


	On May 24, 2016, the Company acquired selected technology assets
	from CMH. As the acquisition was from an entity under common control, the Company recorded these assets at CMH’s carrying
	values, which were zero.


	 


	On May 27, 2016, the Company obtained a 9.9% shareholder stake
	in IBIH Limited (parent company of IronFx Global Group (IronFx)) and acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of GVS
	limited, a BVI corporation (a former subsidiary of IBIH limited). In addition, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
	pursuant to which it has agreed to acquire the remaining equity in IBIH Limited and prior to such closing, the Company is required
	to enter into an option agreement to acquire FML Malta, Ltd. and FXDD Trading Limited operating units, which are affiliates through
	common ownership. These transactions are subject to regulatory approval, where applicable. (See Note 3)


	 


	On June 3, 2016, the Company agreed to sell to CMH 30,900,000
	shares of common stock and 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for $2,000,000 in two equal installments. The first close
	occurred on June 7, 2016. The second close will occur with the closing of the Company’s acquisition of IBIH.


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a going concern, which
	assumes that the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of
	business.   Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses of $257,460 and has a working capital of
	$894,988 at June 30, 2016.   Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the management of
	expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising
	from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.


	 


	We need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through
	equity or debt financings.  However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our stockholders or third parties)
	will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.   Any such
	financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that
	would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
	insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.


	 





	Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Basis of Presentation




	 





	The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have
	been eliminated in consolidation.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
	prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial
	information and with Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
	required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The balance sheet at September
	30, 2015 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America.   The other information in these condensed consolidated
	financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair
	presentation of the results for the periods covered.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
	read in conjunction with the financial statements and additional information as contained in our annual report on Form 10-K
	for the year ended September 30, 2015.

	Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
	less to be cash equivalents.  There were no cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.


	 



	Loss per Common Share



	 


	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable
	to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted
	loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
	common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares
	were dilutive.  There were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the period ended June 30, 2016.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Prior to February 13, 2015, the Company derived its revenue
	from the sale of general compliance and risk management consulting services (professional services revenue).   The Company
	utilizes written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions of services sold to customers.


	 


	Because the Company provides its applications as services, it
	follows the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, 

	Revenue
	Recognition.

	 The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met:


	 






	●


	there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;








	●


	the service has been provided to the customer;








	●


	the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and








	●


	the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.




	 


	The Company records revenues and expenses related to the Global
	Service Agreements at gross as the Company is deemed to be a principal in the transactions. Revenues are recognized when the services
	are completed and expenses are recognized as incurred.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities
	for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial
	statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.


	 


	The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to
	deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred
	tax asset and taking into consideration the Company’s financial position and results of operations for the current period.
	Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period
	under the Federal tax laws.  Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change
	in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in
	income in the year of the change in estimate.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using the available market information and
	valuation methods. Considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value may not
	be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. As of June 30, 2016, the carrying value of
	accrued taxes, accrued liabilities, and due to/due from affiliates approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity
	of these instruments.

	Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2016.  Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic 606).”

	 The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to require an entity to recognize the amount of revenue which it
	expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing
	revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The amendments become effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early application
	is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The
	standard allows an entity to apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 using either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition
	method.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.


	 



	ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about
	an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.”

	This ASU requires management to determine whether
	substantial doubt exists regarding the entity’s going concern presumption, which generally refers to an entity’s
	ability to meet its obligations as they become due. If substantial doubt exists, certain disclosures are required. As such,
	management will now have primary responsibility for the going concern assessment under U.S. GAAP. To date, this
	responsibility has rested principally with the independent auditor. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 apply to all entities,
	unless they have adopted the liquidation basis of accounting under Subtopic 205-30. The new standard applies prospectively to
	annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and to interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.
	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements.



	 




	ASU 2015-01, “Income Statement–Extraordinary
	and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items


	.”

	The FASB believes that eliminating the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP will save time and reduce costs for financial
	statement preparers, and will alleviate uncertainty for preparers, auditors and regulators because auditors and regulators no longer
	will need to evaluate whether a preparer presented an unusual and/or infrequent item appropriately. The presentation and disclosure
	guidance for items that are unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence has been retained and has been expanded to include items
	that are both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence. The nature and financial effects of each event or transaction is
	required to be presented as a separate component of income from continuing operations or, alternatively, in the notes to the financial
	statements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
	2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively
	to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company has implemented this pronouncement.


	 



	ASU 2016-01, “Financial
	Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
	Liabilities.”

	This new guidance makes targeted improvements to existing U.S. GAAP by: (i) requiring equity
	investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the
	investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) requiring public business
	entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (iii)
	requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
	asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial
	statements; (iv) eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost
	for organizations that are not public business entities; (v) eliminating the requirement for public business entities to
	disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for
	financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and (vi) requiring a reporting organization to present
	separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a
	change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as “own credit”) when the organization
	has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Public
	business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
	periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-01 on its
	consolidated financial statements.

	ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).”

	Under
	this new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
	Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease
	by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current U.S. GAAP, which
	requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized
	on the balance sheet. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand
	the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements,
	providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The ASU will take effect for public companies
	for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted.


	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting
	ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.



	 




	ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
	326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”

	This new guidance will require the earlier recognition
	of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that
	is currently in use. Under the new guidance, an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at
	the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The expected loss
	model will apply to loans and leases, unfunded lending commitments, held-to-maturity debt securities and other debt instruments
	measured at amortized cost. The impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities will require the recognition of credit
	losses through a valuation allowance when fair value is less than amortized cost, regardless of whether the impairment is considered
	to be other-than-temporary. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019.


	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting
	ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.


	 



	Management
	does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material
	effect on the accompanying financial statements.

	 


	 



	3. Share Capital



	 


	The Company was authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common
	stock at par value of $0.0001 and 15,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock at par value of $0.0001. On May 26, 2016, the Company
	increased its authorized common shares to 900,000,000.


	 


	On May 24, 2016, CMH sold certain intellectual property, hardware, software and other assets (collectively, the “Assets”) to the Company in consideration of
	48,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company. As the acquisition was from an entity under common control, the Company recorded
	the Assets at CMH’s carrying values, which were zero.


	 


	On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
	to acquire, from IBIH Limited, 2,200 issued and outstanding common stock for $1,000,000, representing 9.9% of IBIH Limited. In
	addition, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of GVS Limited, a BVI corporation (a former subsidiary
	of IBIH Limited) for 24,156,000 shares of common stock of the Company (‘first closing’). The cost of acquisition paid
	in cash has been recorded on the balance sheet as a “deposit on potential acquisition,” and the common stock as “contingent
	common stock” as the transaction is contingent upon regulatory approval (see the following paragraph). The shares were valued
	at $.0023 per share.


	 


	The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of
	IBIH Limited for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH Limited obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial
	Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and from the regulators in Cyprus (‘second closing’). The second closing is
	subject to the Company signing an option agreement with FML Malta, Ltd and FXDD Trading Limited, providing that the Company may
	acquire both entities for $1. If the second closing does not occur before November 28

	th

	, 2016, the $1,000,000 is returned
	to the Company and the first closing is unwound. As a result of the first closing being contingent on the second closing, the 24,156,000
	shares for the purchase of IBIH Limited was recorded as contingent common stock, due to the uncertainty of the closing of the transaction.
	At June 30, 2016, the Company had not recorded an amount to reflect the value of the option to acquire FML Malta Ltd. and FXDD
	Trading Limited.


	 


	The Company agreed to sell to CMH 30,900,000 shares of common
	stock and 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for $2,000,000 in two equal installments. The first close occurred on June
	7, 2016. The second close will occur with the closing of the Company’s acquisition of IBIH.

	The Series A preferred stock has the following key terms:


	 






	1)


	A stated value of $10 per share








	2)


	The holder is entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 1.5% of stated value payable semi-annually on June 30
	and December 31.








	3)


	The preferred stock must be redeemed at the stated value plus any unpaid dividends in 5 years. The Company has a choice of
	redeeming either in cash or in shares of common stock based on a formula in the certificate of designation. The conversion price
	has a floor of $0.20 per share.




	 


	At June 30, 2016, during the first close, 15,450,000 shares of common stock and 100,000 shares of Series
	A preferred stock were issued and were recorded as equity and as a long-term liability, respectively. The $1,000,000 of proceeds
	received was allocated to the common stock and Series A preferred stock according to their relative fair values determined at the
	time of issuance, and as a result, the Company recorded a discount on the Series A preferred stock, which is being amortized to
	interest expense to the date of redemption. The terms of the Series A preferred stock issued represent mandatory redeemable shares,
	with a fixed redemption date (in 5 years) and the Company has a choice of redeeming the instrument either in cash or a variable
	number of shares of common stock. As such, all dividends accrued and/or paid and any accretions are classified as part of interest
	expense.

	the husband of the previous majority shareholder MLH. The Agreement provided for a monthly consulting fee of $5,000. The Agreement
	was mutually and satisfactorily terminated by the parties as of February 24, 2015 and no amount was due to OCBSG. The Company has
	reflected this arrangement in the statement of operations as related party expenses. For the three months ended June 30, 2015,
	there no related party costs and expenses. For the nine months ended June 30, 2015, $14,500 and $13,827 have been allocated to

	Overview



	 


	The management of the Company has stated that the acquisition
	of a 9.9% shareholder stake in IBIH, as well as the acquisition of the operations of IronFX and GVS Ltd. is just a first intended
	step towards the Company’s long term strategy of identifying leading retail forex brands from around the world as well as
	leading financial companies related to the industry, which can potentially be included and synergistically folded into the Company.
	It is the stated intention of the Company’s management to maintain the separate brand identity, operational autonomy, and
	segregated customer deposits for each individual retail forex brand it may potentially acquire in the future, while simultaneously
	capitalizing on efficiencies afforded by scale, shared backbones and optimized regulatory capital structure.


	 


	As a result of these above described transactions, which were
	entered in May 2016, as well as further contemplated transactions, the Company’s goal is to create an industry leading sector
	consolidated platform, combining strong global retail and institutional trading flows covering FX, commodities, futures, CFD and
	equities, with a cutting edge technological product suite, turnkey software and technological development capabilities. These contemplated
	transactions could potentially result in a global financial trading and financial technology group, with operations and clients,
	as well as one of the most comprehensive regulatory licenses coverage in the world.

	Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016; versus
	June 30, 2015 were $2,400,000 and $0 respectively.    Revenues are from general support services rendered to
	a related party.   The significant increase is due to revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May,
	2016. No such agreement was in place as of June 30, 2015.


	 


	Costs of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 versus
	June 30, 2015 were $2,370,000 and $0, respectively.   Cost of revenue represents amount incurred for general support
	services rendered by a related party.  The significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred by the general
	expenses agreement entered in May, 2016. No such agreement existed as of June 30, 2015.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30,
	2016 versus June 30, 2015, were $158,429 versus $8,297, respectively.   These amounts were primarily third party
	professional fees.

	Total revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2016; versus
	June 30, 2015 were $2,400,000 and $32,469, respectively. Revenues in 2016 are for general support services rendered to a related
	party.  The significant increase is due to revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May, 2016. No such agreement
	was in place as of June 30, 2015.


	 


	Costs of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 versus
	June 30, 2015 were $2,370,000 and $14,665, respectively.   Cost of revenues included merchant account charges of
	$0 and $165, respectively.  The remaining amount, $2,370,000 and $14,500, respectively, were related-party costs for
	the delivery of the general support services.   The significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as
	a result of the General Services Agreement entered in May, 2016. No such agreement existed as of June 30, 2015


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the nine months ended June 30,
	2016 versus June 30, 2015 were $168,429 versus $49,395, respectively. The increase in costs was primarily due to the increased

	Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation
	Law, it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers, directors and their affiliates will be entered
	into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders,
	or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate
	review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis.


	 


	With respect to shares issued for services, our board of directors
	determines the value of the services provided and authorizes the issuance of shares based upon the fair market value of our shares.


	  



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

	Based on the evaluation as of the end of the period covered

	and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
	Act”) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under
	the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
	Commission’s (“SECs”) rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
	that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	(b) 

	Changes in the Company’s

	corporation (“Iron Australia”) in consideration of the payment of $1,000,000 and 24,156,000 shares of common stock
	of Nukkleus. The closing occurred on May 27, 2016 (the “First Closing”). An initial payment of $175,000 was paid on
	May 27, 2016 and the balance of $825,000 was paid on June 7, 2016. Nukkleus agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 outstanding
	shares of capital stock of IBIH from the IBIH Shareholders in consideration of 219,844,000 shares of common stock (the “Second
	Closing”) subject to IBIH and its subsidiaries obtaining the required approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority in the
	United Kingdom and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission and the entering into of the Malta Bermuda Option (as previously
	disclosed). Immediately upon acquiring IBIH, Nukkleus will be required to inject $1,000,000 into IBIH for operations. The
	Second Closing has not occurred as of the date hereof.


	 


	On June 3, 2016, the Company and CMH-Bermuda entered into a Securities Purchase agreement pursuant to
	which Nukkleus agreed to sell and CMH-Bermuda agreed to acquire 30,900,000 shares of common stock and 200,000 shares of Series
	A Preferred Stock in consideration of $2,000,000 in two equal tranches. The initial closing of $1,000,000 in consideration of 15,450,000
	shares of common stock and 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock closed on June 7, 2016. The second closing for the identical
	amounts will close concurrently with the closing of Nukkleus’ acquisition of IBIH. The Series A Preferred Stock has a stated
	value of $10.00 per share and the holder is entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of
	the Stated Value per share) of 1.5% per annum payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31. Except as otherwise expressly required
	by law, the Series A Preferred Stock is non-voting except that the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the Preferred
	Stock is required to alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock or alter or amend
	this Certificate of Designation. Within five calendar days from the five year anniversary of the issuance of the Series A
	Preferred Stock, Nukkleus must redeem all or a portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the Stated Value plus
	any unpaid dividends (the “Redemption”). In the event Nukkleus does not implement the Redemption or only partially
	implements the Redemption, then the shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have not been redeemed will be converted into that
	number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the Stated Value plus unpaid dividends by a conversion price equal to the
	20 day closing average prior to conversion, which in no event may be less than $0.20 per share.


	 



	All of the offers and sales

	4(2) of the Securities Act with regard to those sales. No advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the securities.
	The offers and sales were made to a limited number of persons, each of whom was an accredited investor and transfer of the securities
	issued was restricted by the Company in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:  � our future operating results;  � our business prospects;  � any contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;  � the dependence of our future success on the general economy;  � any possible financings; and  � the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.  These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate" or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are described in close proximity to such statements and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are only made as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  Overview  The management of the Company has stated that the acquisition of a 9.9% shareholder stake in IBIH, as well as the acquisition of the operations of IronFX and GVS Ltd. is just a first intended step towards the Company's long term strategy of identifying leading retail forex brands from around the world as well as leading financial companies related to the industry, which can potentially be included and synergistically folded into the Company. It is the stated intention of the Company's management to maintain the separate brand identity, operational autonomy, and segregated customer deposits for each individual retail forex brand it may potentially acquire in the future, while simultaneously capitalizing on efficiencies afforded by scale, shared backbones and optimized regulatory capital structure.  As a result of these above described transactions, which were entered in May 2016, as well as further contemplated transactions, the Company's goal is to create an industry leading sector consolidated platform, combining strong global retail and institutional trading flows covering FX, commodities, futures, CFD and equities, with a cutting edge technological product suite, turnkey software and technological development capabilities. These contemplated transactions could potentially result in a global financial trading and financial technology group, with operations and clients, as well as one of the most comprehensive regulatory licenses coverage in the world.  The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and from the regulators in Cyprus ('second closing'). The second closing is subject to the Company signing an option agreement with FML Malta, Ltd and FXDD Trading Limited, providing that the Company may acquire both entities for $1. The terms of the Agreement stipulated that if the second does not occur before November 28, 2016, the $1,000,000 will be returned to the Company and the first closing will be unwound. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory authority ("CYSEC") granted all regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to be consummated. Thereafter, additional submissions were made to the London FCA to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Then, in December of 2016, the parties agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will be amending the SPA to reflect that no regulatory approval would be needed to complete the second closing, based on further contemplated changes to the transaction structure. The amended SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second closing.  Results of Operations  Summary of Key Results  For the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015  Revenues and Cost of Revenues  Total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015 were $6,000,000 and $0 respectively. Revenues are from general support services rendered to a related party. The significant increase is due to revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May, 2016. No such agreement was in place as of December 31, 2015.  Costs of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015 were $5,925,000 and $0, respectively. Cost of revenue represents amount incurred for general support services rendered by a related party. The significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as a result of the Global Services Agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement existed as of December 31, 2015.  Operating Expenses  Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015, were $121,505 versus $0, respectively. These amounts were primarily third party professional fees.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  At December 31, 2016, we had cash of $0.  We had a total stockholders' deficit of ($288,920) and an accumulated deficit of ($431,144) as of December 31, 2016.  The Company does not have an operating bank account. All expenses are paid by an affiliate. There were no investing or financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2016.  Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers, directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders, or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis.  With respect to shares issued for services, the shares authorized to be issued by the board of directors are recorded at the fair value of the services received, or the fair value of the shares, whichever is more reliably measureable.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We had no outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.  Feb 10, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

	Note 1.  The Company History and Nature of the Business




	 



	Nukkleus Inc. (f/k/a Compliance & Risk
	Management Solutions Inc.) (“Nukkleus” or the “Company”) was formed on July 29, 2013 in the State of Delaware
	as a for-profit Company and established a fiscal year end of September 30. 


	 


	On February 5, 2016, Charms Investments, Ltd
	(“Charms”), the former majority shareholder of the Company, sold 146,535,140 shares of common stock to Currency Mountain
	Holdings Bermuda, Limited (“CMH”), the parent of the Company. CMH is wholly-owned by an entity that is owned by Emil
	Assentato, the Company’s CEO, CFO and Chairman. In addition, on the same date, CMH acquired 3,937,000 shares of common stock
	from another non-affiliated company.  The aggregate purchase price paid by CMH was $347,500.


	 


	On May 24, 2016, Nukkleus, its wholly-owned
	subsidiary, Nukkleus Limited, a Bermuda limited company (the “Subsidiary”), Charms, the former majority shareholder,
	and CMH entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Nukkleus
	purchased from CMH certain intellectual property, hardware, software and other assets (collectively, the “Assets”)
	in consideration of 48,400,000 shares of common stock of Nukkleus.  The Asset Purchase Agreement closed on May 24, 2016
	(the “Closing”).  As a result of such acquisition, our operations are now focused on the operation of a foreign
	exchange trading business utilizing the Assets acquired from CMH.


	 




	On May 24, 2016, the Subsidiary entered
	into a General Services Agreement to provide its software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology
	hardware and software solutions package to FML Malta, Ltd. (“FML Malta”), a private limited liability company formed
	under the laws of Malta. The General Services Agreement entered with FML Malta provides that FML Malta will pay the Subsidiary
	at minimum $2,000,000 per month. Emil Assentato is also the majority member of Max Q Investments LLC (“Max Q”), which
	is managed by Derivative Marketing Associates Inc. (“DMA”).  Mr. Assentato is the sole owner and manager of DMA. 
	Max Q owns 79% of Currency Mountain Malta LLC, which in turn is the sole shareholder of FML Malta. In addition, in order to appropriately
	service FML Malta, the Subsidiary entered into a General Services Agreement with FXDirectDealer LLC (“FXDIRECT”),
	which  provides that the Subsidiary will pay FXDIRECT a minimum of $1,975,000 per month in consideration of providing
	personnel engaged in operational and technical support, marketing, sales support, accounting, risk monitoring, documentation processing
	and customer care and support.  FXDIRECT may terminate this agreement upon providing 90 days’ written notice.  Currency
	Mountain Holdings LLC is the sole shareholder of FXDIRECT.  Max Q is the majority shareholder of Currency Mountain Holdings
	LLC.




	 




	On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a
	Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to acquire, from IBIH Limited, a BVI corporation (“IBIH”) 2,200 issued
	and outstanding common stock for $1,000,000, representing 9.9% of IBIH. In addition, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and
	outstanding shares of GVS Limited, a BVI corporation (“Iron Australia”) for 24,156,000 shares of common stock of the
	Company (‘first closing’). The cost of acquisition paid in cash has been recorded on the balance sheet as a “deposit
	on potential acquisition,” and the common stock as “contingent common stock” as the transaction is contingent
	upon regulatory approval (see the following paragraph).


	 


	The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH
	for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority
	in the United Kingdom (“London FCA”) and from the regulators in Cyprus (‘second closing’). The second closing
	is subject to the Company signing an option agreement with FML Malta and FXDD Trading Limited operating units (the “Option”),
	which are affiliates through common ownership, providing that the Company may acquire both entities for $1. These transactions
	are subject to regulatory approval, where applicable.


	 


	The terms of the Agreement stipulated that if the second closing
	does not occur before November 28, 2016, the $1,000,000 will be returned to the Company and the first closing will be unwound.
	As a result of the first closing being contingent on the second closing, the 24,156,000 shares for the purchase of IBIH was recorded
	as contingent common stock, due to the uncertainty of the closing of the transaction. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory
	authority (“CYSEC”) granted all regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to be consummated. Thereafter,
	additional submissions were made to the London FCA to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of
	the SPA. Then, in December of 2016, the parties agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will
	be amending the SPA to reflect that no regulatory approval would be needed to complete the second closing, based on further contemplated
	changes to the transaction structure. The amended SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second
	closing.


	 


	As part of the above transaction, the parties
	have entered into an engagement agreement with Bentley Associates L.P. (“Bentley”) providing that Nukkleus will pay
	Bentley $600,000 in consideration of financial advisory services associated with the acquisition of IBIH. The fee may be paid in
	cash or stock but the cash portion may not be less than $400,000 and is to be paid following the closing of a financing transaction
	in excess of $2,500,000, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the engagement agreement.


	 


	The Company agreed to sell to CMH 30,900,000
	shares of common stock and 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for $2,000,000 in two equal installments. The first close

	Iron Australia has 100% ownership in GVS (AU)
	Pty Ltd (“GVS”). GVS was incorporated on April 15, 2010 as a company structured to operate in the financial services
	sector. It is authorized and regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and has an Australian Financial
	Services License (AFSL no. 417482) to allow for the provision of advice, deal and make a market in derivatives and foreign exchange
	contracts to retail and wholesale clients. GVS services wholesale and retail clients within Australia and the Asia Pacific region
	under the brand names used by IBIH. GVS currently deals as principal when dealing / issuing and acting as a market maker in derivatives
	and foreign exchange contracts. GVS provides, via its trading platform, to its clients direct access to the rates/prices at which
	GVS is prepared to deal. All clients’ transactions are executed with GVS and then automatically hedged on a back to back
	basis with its regulated affiliate counterparty, IronFX Global Limited, a subsidiary of IBIH. GVS has the necessary organizational
	functions/units as well as the required personnel in place to perform its operations. This includes an appointed Responsible Manager
	and additional staff such as a sales manager, certain number of account managers and outsourced professionals.


	 


	IBIH, which the Company presently owns 9.9% of the issued and outstanding capital stock, through its brand
	IronFX, is a leading online provider of retail foreign exchange (FX) trading and related online trading services with offices in
	eight countries around the world (but excluding the United States and U.S. territories). IronFX offers its customers 24-hour, five
	days a week direct access to the global over-the-counter (OTC) FX market, which is a decentralized market in which participants
	trade directly with one another rather than through a central exchange. In an FX trade, participants effectively buy one currency
	and simultaneously sell another currency, with the two currencies that make up the trade being referred to as a “currency
	pair.” IronFX presents customers with price quotations on over 200 tradable instruments, including over 120 currency pairs,
	and provides customers the ability to trade FX derivatives contracts on currency pairs through a product referred to as Contracts
	For Difference (CFD). IronFX also offers other CFD products, including CFDs on metals, such as gold, on European and U.S. listed
	stocks and on futures linked to other products. Since IronFX commenced operations in December 2010, it experienced rapid growth
	until 2014. From 2014, it commenced an overall restructuring program with a view to reduce costs in light of the market conditions
	following the Swiss National Bank event.


	 




	On June 3, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate
	of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation amending the first paragraph of the fourth article increasing its authorized shares
	of common stock to 900,000,000. The par value and preferred shares were not amended.


	 


	On August 1, 2016, the size of the Board of
	Directors of the Company was increased from one to six and Craig Marshak, Jacob Lahav, Markos A. Kashiouris, Efstathios Christophi
	and Petros G. Economides were appointed as directors of the Company.


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America applicable for a going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets
	and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business.   Since inception, the Company has incurred net
	losses of $514,338.


	 


	The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
	upon the management of expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its
	liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.


	 


	The Company either needs to borrow funds or raise additional capital
	through equity or debt financings.  However, it cannot be certain that such capital (from its stockholders or third parties)
	will be available or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable. Any such financing likely would
	be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact
	its business. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, it will have insufficient funds
	to operate its business or pursue its planned growth.

	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include
	the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
	in consolidation.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
	of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for
	interim financial information and with Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
	and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The consolidated balance
	sheet at September 30, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   The other information in these condensed consolidated
	financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
	of the results for the periods covered.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
	with the financial statements and additional information as contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
	30, 2016.

	Loss per Common Share



	 


	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable
	to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted
	loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
	common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares
	were dilutive.  There were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the period ended March 31, 2017.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Prior to February 13, 2015, the Company derived its revenue from
	the sale of general compliance and risk management consulting services (professional services revenue).   The Company
	utilizes written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions of services sold to customers.


	 


	Because the Company provides its applications as services, it follows
	the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, 

	Revenue
	Recognition.

	 The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met:


	 






	●



	there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;









	 



	●




	the service has been provided to the customer;









	 



	●




	the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and









	 



	●




	the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.





	 


	The Company records revenues and expenses related to the Global
	Service Agreements at gross as the Company is deemed to be a principal in the transactions. Revenues are recognized when the services
	are completed and expenses are recognized as incurred.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using
	the available market information and valuation methods. Considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value. Accordingly,
	the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. As of
	March 31, 2017, the carrying value of accrued taxes, accrued liabilities, and due to/due from affiliates approximated fair value
	due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.

	Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2017.  Actual results could differ from those estimates
	made by management.

	ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606).”

	 The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to require an entity to recognize the amount of revenue which it expects
	to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue
	recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The amendments become effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company), including interim periods within that
	reporting period.  Early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
	interim periods within that reporting period.  The standard allows an entity to apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 using
	either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects of
	adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.


	 



	ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
	Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.”

	This ASU requires management to determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding
	the entity’s going concern presumption, which generally refers to an entity’s ability to meet its obligations as they
	become due. If substantial doubt exists, certain disclosures are required. As such, management will now have primary responsibility
	for the going concern assessment under U.S. GAAP. To date, this responsibility has rested principally with the independent auditor.
	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 apply to all entities, unless they have adopted the liquidation basis of accounting under Subtopic
	205-30. The new standard applies prospectively to annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, (year ended September 30, 2017
	for the Company), and to interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
	the effects of adopting ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements, but the adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to
	have a significant impact.



	 




	 ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic
	810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.”

	Effective October 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02. The amendments
	in ASU 2015-02 change the analysis that the reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types
	of legal entities. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in ASU 2015-02 using a modified retrospective approach by recording
	a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply
	the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements.


	 



	ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification
	of Deferred Taxes.”

	In November 2015, the FASB issued (“ASU 2015-17”). ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax
	assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 becomes effective for interim
	and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (year ended September 30, 2017 for the Company). Early adoption
	is permitted. A reporting entity should apply the amendment prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating
	the effects of adopting ASU 2015-17 on its consolidated financial statements but the adoption is not expected to have a significant
	impact as the Company continues to provide a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.



	 




	ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic
	825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”

	This new guidance makes targeted
	improvements to existing U.S. GAAP by: (i) requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of
	accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
	in net income; (ii) requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial
	instruments for disclosure purposes; (iii) requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement
	category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes
	to the financial statements; (iv) eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized
	cost for organizations that are not public business entities; (v) eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose
	the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments
	measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and (vi) requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive
	income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit
	risk (also referred to as “own credit”) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in
	accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2017, (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company), including interim periods within those
	fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements.

	ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).”

	Under this
	new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
	Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease
	by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current U.S. GAAP, which
	requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized
	on the balance sheet. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand
	the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements,
	providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The ASU will take effect for public companies
	for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. (year ended September 30, 2020
	for the Company). Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated
	financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact as of the filing of this report.


	 



	ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU2016-10”).” 

	The amendments in ASU 2016-10
	clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) Identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance.
	The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The pronouncement has the same effective date as
	the new revenue standard, which is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
	December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company). The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting
	ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.



	 




	ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”).” 

	The amendments in ASU 2016-12
	provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. Specifically, the amendments in this update
	(1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in step 1, and provides additional clarification for when to recognize
	revenue for a contract that fails step 1, (2) permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected
	from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price, (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash
	consideration is contract inception, and clarifies that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting
	from reasons other than the form of the consideration, (4) provide a practical expedients that permits an entity to reflect the
	aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied
	and unsatisfied performance obligations, (5) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which
	all (or substantially all) of the revenues was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Further, accounting
	for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract
	is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts
	or only to contracts that are not completed contracts, and (6) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance
	in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption.
	However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective
	date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements as Topic 606.
	The guidance will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the ASU 2014-09 . The Company is currently evaluating
	the effects of adopting ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements.



	 




	ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification

	 ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in
	practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayments or extinguishment costs, the
	maturing of a zero coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance
	settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization.
	ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these
	cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
	December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company). Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
	the effects of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a significant
	impact as of the filing of this report.

	ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers
	of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”).”

	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 with the objective
	to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new standard
	will require entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of non-inventory asset when the transfer
	occurs. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company),
	and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial

	ASU 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held

	In October 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-17 which amends the guidance issued with ASU 2015-02 in order to make it less likely that a single decision maker would
	individually meet the characteristics to be the primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"). When a decision
	maker or service provider considers indirect interests held through related parties under common control, they perform two steps.
	The second step was amended with this guidance to say that the decision maker should consider interests held by these related parties
	on a proportionate basis when determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE rather than in their entirety as was called for in
	the previous guidance. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 year ended September 30, 2018
	for the Company), and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-17

	ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying
	the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”).”

	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 to clarify the
	definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be
	accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting
	including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December
	15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company), including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently
	evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2017-01 on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	Management does not believe that any other
	recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying
	financial statements.


	 



	3. Share Capital



	 


	On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
	(“SPA”) to acquire, from IBIH, 2,200 issued and outstanding common stock for $1,000,000, representing 9.9% of IBIH.
	In addition, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Iron Australia for 24,156,000 shares of common stock
	of the Company (‘first closing’). The cost of acquisition paid in cash has been recorded on the balance sheet as a
	“deposit on potential acquisition,” and the common stock as “contingent common stock” as the transaction
	is contingent upon regulatory approval (see the following paragraph). The shares were valued at $.0023 per share. The deposit on
	potential acquisition was moved to non-current assets as of December 31, 2016, due to the uncertainty of the timing of the second
	closing as noted below.


	 


	The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH
	for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority
	in the United Kingdom (“London FCA”) and from the regulators in Cyprus (‘second closing’). The second closing
	is subject to the Company signing an option agreement with FML Malta and FXDD Trading Limited, providing that the Company may acquire
	both entities for $1. The terms of the Agreement stipulated that if the second closing does not occur before November 28, 2016,
	the $1,000,000 will be returned to the Company and the first closing will be unwound. As a result of the first closing being contingent
	on the second closing, the 24,156,000 shares for the purchase of IBIH was recorded as contingent common stock, due to the uncertainty
	of the closing of the transaction. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory authority (“CYSEC”) granted all
	regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to be consummated. Thereafter, additional submissions were made to the London
	FCA to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Then, in December of 2016, the parties
	agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will be amending the SPA to reflect that no regulatory
	approval would be needed to complete the second closing, based on further contemplated changes to the transaction structure. The
	amended SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second closing.


	 


	The Company agreed to sell to CMH 30,900,000 shares of common stock
	and 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for $2,000,000 in two equal installments. The first close occurred on June 7, 2016.
	The second close will occur with the closing of the Company’s acquisition of IBIH.

	shares of Series A preferred stock were issued and were recorded as equity and as a long-term liability, respectively. The $1,000,000
	of proceeds received was allocated to the common stock and Series A preferred stock according to their relative fair values determined
	at the time of issuance, and as a result, the Company recorded a discount on the Series A preferred stock, which is being amortized
	to interest expense to the date of redemption. The terms of the Series A preferred stock issued represent mandatory redeemable
	shares, with a fixed redemption date (in 5 years) and the Company has a choice of redeeming the instrument either in cash or a
	variable number of shares of common stock based on a formula in the certificate of designation. The conversion price has a floor
	of $0.20 per share. As such, all dividends accrued and/or paid and any accretions are classified as part of interest expense.

	On May 23, 2016, the Company engaged Bentley
	to act as the Company’s exclusive financial advisor (the “Bentley Engagement”) in connection with the IronFX
	transaction related to the SPA in consideration of a transaction fee equal to approximately $600,000 in cash and stock of the Company
	(the “Transaction Fee”). This transaction fee is payable upon the consummation of the IronFX transaction. As part of
	the Bentley Engagement, Mr. Craig Marshak, a director, acted as a sub-advisor to Bentley and is entitled to a portion of the Transaction
	Fee. The Company has not paid or recorded any fees as of March 31, 2017 in connection with the Bentley Engagement, as the Transaction
	Fee is a contingent liability and will be recorded upon consummation of the related transaction.


	 




	Nukkleus agreed to retain Craig Marshak, a principal of Triple Eight
	Markets, for a term of 18 months with a monthly fee of $7,000 to act as a business and financial advisor. Under this agreement
	and as compensation for other services provided, the Company has recognized an expense related to Triple Eight Markets, a total
	of $15,000 and $65,000 for the three and six months period ended March 31, 2017, respectively.


	 


	Nukkleus uses affiliate employees for various services such as the
	use of accountants to record the books and accounts of the Company at no charge to those affiliates. Also, the Company uses office
	space of affiliate companies, free of rent.


	 




	On May 24, 2016, the Company acquired selected technology assets
	from CMH. These assets were originally acquired by CMH from Forexware, LLC and FXDIRECT. All of these entities are related companies
	through common control. CMH agreed to permit Forexware, LLC and FXDIRECT a perpetual, irrevocable, non-assignable (except for such
	assignments resulting from a merger and/or acquisition), royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide non-exclusive, limited license
	to the Intellectual Property. As the acquisition was from an entity under common control, the Company recorded these assets at
	CMH’s carrying values, which were zero.



	 



	On May 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Global Service Agreement with FXDD Trading Limited. This service
	agreement was replaced by one with FML Malta, a related party, with substantially the same terms. The Company is to invoice FML
	Malta a minimum of $2,000,000 per month in consideration for providing personnel and technical support, marketing, accounting,
	risk monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and support.


	 


	In addition, the Company entered into a Global Service Agreement
	with FXDIRECT to pay a minimum of $1,975,000 per month for receiving personnel and technical support, marketing, accounting, risk
	monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and support. Currency Mountain Holdings LLC is the sole shareholder of FXDIRECT.  Max

	These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as
	such because the context of the statement will include words such as we “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,”
	“estimate” or words of similar meaning.   Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives
	or goals are also forward-looking statements.   Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
	which are described in close proximity to such statements and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
	anticipated as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q.   Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged
	to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
	statements.  The forward-looking statements included herein are only made as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and
	we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.


	 


	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect
	our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.


	 



	Overview



	 


	The management of the Company has stated that the acquisition of
	a 9.9% shareholder stake in IBIH, as well as the acquisition of the operations of IronFX and GVS Ltd. is just a first intended
	step towards the Company’s long term strategy of identifying leading retail forex brands from around the world as well as
	leading financial companies related to the industry, which can potentially be included and synergistically folded into the Company.
	It is the stated intention of the Company’s management to maintain the separate brand identity, operational autonomy, and
	segregated customer deposits for each individual retail forex brand it may potentially acquire in the future, while simultaneously
	capitalizing on efficiencies afforded by scale, shared backbones and optimized regulatory capital structure.


	 


	As a result of these above described transactions, which were entered
	in May 2016, as well as further contemplated transactions, the Company’s goal is to create an industry leading sector consolidated
	platform, combining strong global retail and institutional trading flows covering FX, commodities, futures, CFD and equities, with
	a cutting edge technological product suite, turnkey software and technological development capabilities. These contemplated transactions
	could potentially result in a global financial trading and financial technology group, with operations and clients, as well as
	one of the most comprehensive regulatory licenses coverage in the world.


	 


	The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH
	for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority
	in the United Kingdom and from the regulators in Cyprus (‘second closing’). The second closing is subject to the Company
	signing an option agreement with FML Malta, Ltd and FXDD Trading Limited, providing that the Company may acquire both entities
	for $1. The terms of the Agreement stipulated that if the second does not occur before November 28, 2016, the $1,000,000 will be
	returned to the Company and the first closing will be unwound. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory authority (“CYSEC”)
	granted all regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to be consummated. Thereafter, additional submissions were made
	to the London FCA to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Then, in December of 2016,
	the parties agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will be amending the SPA to reflect that
	no regulatory approval would be needed to complete the second closing, based on further contemplated changes to the transaction
	structure. The amended SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second closing.

	Revenues and Cost of Revenues



	 




	Total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus
	March 31, 2016 were $6,000,000 and $0, respectively. Revenues are from general support services rendered to a related party. The
	significant increase is due to revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement was in place
	as of March 31, 2016.


	 


	Costs of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus
	March 31, 2016 were $5,925,000 and $0, respectively.  Cost of revenue represents amount incurred for general support
	services rendered by a related party.  The significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as a result of
	the Global Services Agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement existed as of March 31, 2016.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31,
	2017 versus March 31, 2016, were $152,154 versus $10,000, respectively.  These amounts were primarily third-party professional
	fees.


	 



	For the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016




	 




	Revenues and Cost of Revenues



	 




	Total revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus March
	31, 2016 were $12,000,000 and $0, respectively. Revenues are from general support services rendered to a related party. The
	significant increase is due to revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement was in place
	as of March 31, 2016.


	 


	Costs of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus
	March 31, 2016 were $11,850,000 and $0, respectively.  Cost of revenue represents amount incurred for general support
	services rendered by a related party.  The significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as a result of
	the Global Services Agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement existed as of March 31, 2016.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31,
	2017 versus March 31, 2016, were $273,659 versus $10,000, respectively.   These amounts were primarily third-party
	professional fees.


	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At March 31, 2017, we had cash of $0.


	 


	We had a total stockholders’ deficit of ($372,114) and
	an accumulated deficit of ($514,338) as of March 31, 2017.


	 




	All disbursements have been paid by affiliates. There were no investing
	or financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	management of expenses and our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and pay our liabilities arising
	from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.




	 




	We need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through
	equity or debt financings.  However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our stockholders or third parties)
	will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.   Any such
	financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that
	would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
	insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.

	Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation
	Law, it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers, directors and their affiliates will be entered
	into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders,
	or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate
	review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis.


	 


	With respect to shares issued for services, the shares authorized
	to be issued by the board of directors are recorded at the fair value of the services received, or the fair value of the shares,
	whichever is more reliably measureable.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We had no outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance
	sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving
	non-exchange traded contracts.

	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer /Chief Financial Officer
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company.


	 


	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	 


	In the Form 10-K filed by the Company for the year ended
	September 30, 2016 and the Form 10-Q filed for the three months ended December 31, 2016, we identified a material weakness in our
	internal control over financial reporting related to the lack of segregation of duties due to the Company's small size. During
	the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
	of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were effective.


	 


	Steps taken during fiscal 2017 to remediate its material
	weakness were:


	 






	 



	•




	Improved the coordination and communication between the Company and its outsourced accounting consultants ("accountants") regarding the financial reporting process and internal controls over the accounting for non-routine, complex transactions;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	Developed written policies and procedures, and tested the controls to ascertain that the controls are being satisfactorily followed.  







	 


	Management believes the changes discussed above are sufficient to mitigate the material weakness identified.


	 


	(b) Changes in the Company's Internal Controls over Financial
	Reporting


	 


	Other than described above, there have been no changes
	in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
	affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements.  Such
forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and
uncertainties, including statements as to:
 · our future operating results;
  · our business prospects;
  · any contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;
  · the dependence of our future success on the general economy;
  · any possible financings; and
  · the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.
These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the
context of the statement will include words such as we "believe," "anticipate,"
"expect," "estimate" or words of similar meaning.  Similarly, statements that
describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking
statements.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties which are described in close proximity to such statements and
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as
of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q.  Shareholders, potential investors and
other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the
forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such
forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements included herein are
only made as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no
obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect
subsequent events or circumstances.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements.



Overview



The management of the Company has stated that the acquisition of a 9.9%
shareholder stake in IBIH, as well as the acquisition of the operations of
IronFX and GVS Ltd. is just a first intended step towards the Company's long
term strategy of identifying leading retail forex brands from around the world
as well as leading financial companies related to the industry, which can
potentially be included and synergistically folded into the Company. It is the
stated intention of the Company's management to maintain the separate brand
identity, operational autonomy, and segregated customer deposits for each
individual retail forex brand it may potentially acquire in the future, while
simultaneously capitalizing on efficiencies afforded by scale, shared backbones
and optimized regulatory capital structure.
As a result of these above described transactions, which were entered in May
2016, as well as further contemplated transactions, the Company's goal is to
create an industry leading sector consolidated platform, combining strong global
retail and institutional trading flows covering FX, commodities, futures, CFD
and equities, with a cutting edge technological product suite, turnkey software
and technological development capabilities. These contemplated transactions
could potentially result in a global financial trading and financial technology
group, with operations and clients, as well as one of the most comprehensive
regulatory licenses coverage in the world.
The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH for
219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory
approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and from
the regulators in Cyprus ('second closing'). The second closing is subject to
the Company signing an option agreement with FML Malta, Ltd and FXDD Trading
Limited, providing that the Company may acquire both entities for $1. The terms
of the Agreement stipulated that if the second does not occur before November
28, 2016, the $1,000,000 will be returned to the Company and the first closing
will be unwound. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory authority
("CYSEC") granted all regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to
be consummated. Thereafter, additional submissions were made to the London FCA
to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the
SPA. Then, in December of 2016, the parties agreed to suspend the request for
regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will be amending the SPA to reflect
that no regulatory approval would be needed to complete the second closing,
based on further contemplated changes to the transaction structure. The amended
SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second
closing.

Results of Operations



Summary of Key Results




For the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016



Revenues and Cost of Revenues



Total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016
were $6,000,000 and $0, respectively. Revenues are from general support services
rendered to a related party. The significant increase is due to revenues derived
from the service agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement was in place
as of March 31, 2016.
Costs of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31,
2016 were $5,925,000 and $0, respectively. Cost of revenue represents amount
incurred for general support services rendered by a related party. The
significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as a result of the
Global Services Agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement existed as of
March 31, 2016.




Operating Expenses




Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus March
31, 2016, were $152,154 versus $10,000, respectively. These amounts were
primarily third-party professional fees.
For the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016
Revenues and Cost of Revenues
Total revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016
were $12,000,000 and $0, respectively. Revenues are from general support
services rendered to a related party. The significant increase is due to
revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May 2016. No such
agreement was in place as of March 31, 2016.
Costs of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016
were $11,850,000 and $0, respectively. Cost of revenue represents amount
incurred for general support services rendered by a related party. The
significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as a result of the
Global Services Agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement existed as of
March 31, 2016.




Operating Expenses




Total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2017 versus March
31, 2016, were $273,659 versus $10,000, respectively.  These amounts were
primarily third-party professional fees.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At March 31, 2017, we had cash of $0.
We had a total stockholders' deficit of ($372,114) and an accumulated deficit of
($514,338) as of March 31, 2017.
All disbursements have been paid by affiliates. There were no investing or
financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the management of
expenses and our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our
obligations and pay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when
they come due, and upon profitable operations.
We need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through equity or
debt financings. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our
stockholders or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital
will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.  Any such financing likely
would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant
financial operating covenants that would negatively impact our business. If we
are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will
have insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.



  5






Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, it is our
current policy that all transactions between us and our officers, directors and
their affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are approved by
a majority of the disinterested directors, are approved by vote of the
stockholders, or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate
review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis.
With respect to shares issued for services, the shares authorized to be issued
by the board of directors are recorded at the fair value of the services
received, or the fair value of the shares, whichever is more reliably
measureable.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had no outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet
guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do
not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

NUKKLEUS INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
 
Note 1.  The Company History and Nature of the Business 
 
Nukkleus Inc. (f/k/a Compliance & Risk
Management Solutions Inc.) (“Nukkleus” or the “Company”) was formed on July 29, 2013 in the State of Delaware
as a for-profit Company and established a fiscal year end of September 30.   
 
On February 5, 2016, Charms Investments, Ltd
(“Charms”), the former majority shareholder of the Company, sold 146,535,140 shares of common stock to Currency Mountain
Holdings Bermuda, Limited (“CMH”), the parent of the Company. CMH is wholly-owned by an entity that is owned by Emil
Assentato, the Company’s CEO, CFO and Chairman. In addition, on the same date, CMH acquired 3,937,000 shares of common stock
from another non-affiliated company.  The aggregate purchase price paid by CMH was $347,500. 
 
On May 24, 2016, Nukkleus, its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Nukkleus Limited, a Bermuda limited company (the “Subsidiary”), Charms, the former majority shareholder,
and CMH entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Nukkleus
purchased from CMH certain intellectual property, hardware, software and other assets (collectively, the “Assets”)
in consideration of 48,400,000 shares of common stock of Nukkleus.  The Asset Purchase Agreement closed on May 24, 2016
(the “Closing”).  As a result of such acquisition, our operations are now focused on the operation of a foreign
exchange trading business utilizing the Assets acquired from CMH.
  
On May 24, 2016, the Subsidiary entered
into a General Services Agreement to provide its software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology
hardware and software solutions package to FML Malta, Ltd. (“FML Malta”), a private limited liability company formed
under the laws of Malta. The General Services Agreement entered with FML Malta provides that FML Malta will pay the Subsidiary
at minimum $2,000,000 per month. Emil Assentato is also the majority member of Max Q Investments LLC (“Max Q”), which
is managed by Derivative Marketing Associates Inc. (“DMA”).  Mr. Assentato is the sole owner and manager of DMA. 
Max Q owns 79% of Currency Mountain Malta LLC, which in turn is the sole shareholder of FML Malta. In addition, in order to appropriately
service FML Malta, the Subsidiary entered into a General Services Agreement with FXDirectDealer LLC (“FXDIRECT”),
which  provides that the Subsidiary will pay FXDIRECT a minimum of $1,975,000 per month in consideration of providing
personnel engaged in operational and technical support, marketing, sales support, accounting, risk monitoring, documentation processing
and customer care and support.  FXDIRECT may terminate this agreement upon providing 90 days’ written notice.  Currency
Mountain Holdings LLC is the sole shareholder of FXDIRECT.  Max Q is the majority shareholder of Currency Mountain Holdings
LLC.
 
On May 27, 2016, the Company obtained a 9.9%
shareholder stake in IBIH Limited, a BVI corporation (“IBIH”) and acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of GVS Limited, a BVI corporation (“Iron Australia”). In addition, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement pursuant to which it agreed to acquire the remaining equity in IBIH and prior to such closing, the Company is
required to enter into an option agreement to acquire FML Malta and FXDD Trading Limited operating units (the “Option”),
which are affiliates through common ownership. These transactions are subject to regulatory approval, where applicable. As part
of the above transaction, the parties have entered into an engagement agreement with Bentley Associates L.P. (“Bentley”)
providing that Nukkleus will pay Bentley $600,000 in consideration of financial advisory services associated with the acquisition
of IBIH. The fee may be paid in cash or stock but the cash portion may not be less than $400,000 and is to be paid following the
closing of a financing transaction in excess of $2,500,000, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the engagement
agreement.

Iron Australia has 100% ownership in GVS (AU)
Pty Ltd (“GVS”). GVS was incorporated on April 15, 2010 as a company structured to operate in the financial services
sector. It is authorized and regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and has an Australian Financial
Services Licence (AFSL no. 417482) to allow for the provision of advice, deal and make a market in derivatives and foreign exchange
contracts to retail and wholesale clients. GVS services wholesale and retail clients within Australia and the Asia Pacific region
under the brand names used by IBIH. GVS currently deals as principal when dealing / issuing and acting as a market maker in derivatives
and foreign exchange contracts. GVS provides, via its trading platform, to its clients direct access to the rates/prices at which
GVS is prepared to deal. All clients’ transactions are executed with GVS and then automatically hedged on a back to back
basis with its regulated affiliate counterparty, IronFX Global Limited, a subsidiary of IBIH. GVS has the necessary organizational
functions/units as well as the required personnel in place to perform its operations. This includes an appointed Responsible Manager
and additional staff such as a sales manager, certain number of account managers and outsourced professionals.
 
IBIH, which the Company presently owns 9.9%
of the issued and outstanding capital stock, through its brand IronFX, is a leading online provider of retail foreign exchange
(FX) trading and related online trading services with offices in eight countries around the world (but excluding the United States
and U.S. territories). IronFX offers its customers 24-hour, five days a week direct access to the global over-the-counter (OTC)
FX market, which is a decentralized market in which participants trade directly with one another rather than through a central
exchange. In an FX trade, participants effectively buy one currency and simultaneously sell another currency, with the two currencies
that make up the trade being referred to as a “currency pair.” IronFX presents our customers with price quotations
on over 200 tradable instruments, including over 120 currency pairs, and provides our customers the ability to trade FX derivatives
contracts on currency pairs through a product referred to as Contracts For Difference (CFD). We also offer other CFD products,
including CFDs on metals, such as gold, on European and U.S. listed stocks and on futures linked to other products. Since IronFX
commenced operations in December 2010, it experienced rapid growth until 2014. From 2014, it commenced an overall restructuring
program with a view to reduce costs in light of the market conditions following the Swiss National Bank event.
 
On June 3, 2016, the Company agreed to sell
to CMH 30,900,000 shares of common stock and 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for $2,000,000 in two equal installments.
The first close occurred on June 7, 2016. The second close will occur with the closing of the Company’s acquisition of IBIH.
 
On June 3, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate
of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation amending the first paragraph of the fourth article increasing its authorized shares
of common stock to 900,000,000. The par value and preferred shares were not amended.
 
On August 1, 2016, the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company was increased from one to six and Craig Marshak, Jacob Lahav, Markos A. Kashiouris, Efstathios Christophi
and Petros G. Economides were appointed as directors of the Company.
 
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a going concern, which assumes that
the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business.   Since inception,
the Company has incurred net losses of $431,144.   Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the management of expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.
 
We need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through
equity or debt financings.  However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our stockholders or third parties)
will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.   Any such
financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that
would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.

 
Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for
interim financial information and with Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The consolidated balance
sheet at September 30, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   The other information in these condensed consolidated
financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
of the results for the periods covered.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and additional information as contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
30, 2016.
 

 F-5 
 

  
Loss per Common Share
 
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable
to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted
loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive.  There were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the period ended December 31,
2016.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Prior to February 13, 2015, the Company derived its revenue from
the sale of general compliance and risk management consulting services (professional services revenue).   The Company
utilizes written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions of services sold to customers.
 
Because the Company provides its applications as services, it follows
the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, Revenue
Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
 

●there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;

●the service has been provided to the customer;

●the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and

●the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
 
The Company records revenues and expenses related to the Global
Service Agreements at gross as the Company is deemed to be a principal in the transactions. Revenues are recognized when the services
are completed and expenses are recognized as incurred.
  
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using
the available market information and valuation methods. Considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value. Accordingly,
the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. As of
December 31, 2016, the carrying value of accrued taxes, accrued liabilities, and due to/due from affiliates approximated fair value
due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.
 

 F-6 
 

  
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016.  Actual results could differ from those estimates
made by management.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606).”  The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to require an entity to recognize the amount of revenue which it expects
to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing
revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The amendments become effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company), including interim periods
within that reporting period.  Early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The standard allows an entity to apply the amendments
in ASU 2014-09 using either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.
 
ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” This ASU requires management to determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding
the entity’s going concern presumption, which generally refers to an entity’s ability to meet its obligations as they
become due. If substantial doubt exists, certain disclosures are required. As such, management will now have primary responsibility
for the going concern assessment under U.S. GAAP. To date, this responsibility has rested principally with the independent auditor.
The amendments in ASU 2014-15 apply to all entities, unless they have adopted the liquidation basis of accounting under Subtopic
205-30. The new standard applies prospectively to annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, (year ended September 30, 2017
for the Company), and to interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of adopting ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements, but the adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to
have a significant impact.
 
 ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments
to the Consolidation Analysis.” Effective October 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02. The amendments in ASU 2015-02
change the analysis that the reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.
A reporting entity may apply the amendments in ASU 2015-02 using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect
adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively.
The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes.” In November 2015, the FASB issued (“ASU 2015-17”). ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax
assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 becomes effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (year ended September 30, 2017 for the Company). Early adoption
is permitted. A reporting entity should apply the amendment prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of adopting ASU 2015-17 on its consolidated financial statements but the adoption is not expected to have a significant
impact as the Company continues to provide a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.

 
ASU 2016-01, “Financial
Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”
This new guidance makes targeted improvements to existing U.S. GAAP by: (i) requiring equity investments (except those accounted
for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value
with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when
measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (iii) requiring separate presentation of financial
assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables)
on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; (iv) eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair
value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities; (v) eliminating
the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value
that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and (vi) requiring
a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value
of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as “own credit”) when
the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.
Public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, (year ended September
30, 2019 for the Company), including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements.
 

 F-7 
 

  
ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” Under this
new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease
by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current U.S. GAAP, which
requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized
on the balance sheet. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand
the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements,
providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The ASU will take effect for public companies
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. (year ended September 30, 2020
for the Company). Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated
financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact as of the filing of this report.
 
ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU2016-10”).” The amendments in ASU 2016-10
clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) Identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance.
The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The pronouncement has the same effective date as
the new revenue standard, which is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company). The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting
ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.
 
ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”).” The amendments in ASU 2016-12
provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. Specifically, the amendments in this update
(1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in step 1, and provides additional clarification for when to recognize
revenue for a contract that fails step 1, (2) permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected
from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price, (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash
consideration is contract inception, and clarifies that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting
from reasons other than the form of the consideration, (4) provide a practical expedients that permits an entity to reflect the
aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied
and unsatisfied performance obligations, (5) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which
all (or substantially all) of the revenues was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Further, accounting
for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract
is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts
or only to contracts that are not completed contracts, and (6) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance
in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption.
However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective
date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements as Topic 606.
The guidance will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the ASU 2014-09 . The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of adopting ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
 
ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”).” ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in
practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayments or extinguishment costs, the
maturing of a zero coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance
settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization.
ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these
cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company). Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a significant
impact as of the filing of this report.

ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers
of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”).” In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 with the objective
to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new standard
will require entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of non-inventory asset when the transfer
occurs. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company),
and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial
statements but the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact as of the filing of this report.
 
ASU 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held
through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control (“ASU 2016-17”).” In October 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-17 which amends the guidance issued with ASU 2015-02 in order to make it less likely that a single decision maker would
individually meet the characteristics to be the primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"). When a decision
maker or service provider considers indirect interests held through related parties under common control, they perform two steps.
The second step was amended with this guidance to say that the decision maker should consider interests held by these related parties
on a proportionate basis when determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE rather than in their entirety as was called for in
the previous guidance. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 year ended September 30, 2018
for the Company), and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2016-17
on its consolidated financial statements but the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact as of the filing of this
report.
 
ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying
the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”).” In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 to clarify the
definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be
accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting
including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017 (year ended September 30, 2019 for the Company), including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2017-01 on its consolidated financial statements.
 
Management does not believe that any other
recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying
financial statements.
 
3. Share Capital
 

On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
(“SPA”) to acquire, from IBIH, 2,200 issued and outstanding common stock for $1,000,000, representing 9.9% of IBIH.
In addition, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Iron Australia for 24,156,000 shares of common stock
of the Company (‘first closing’). The cost of acquisition paid in cash has been recorded on the balance sheet as a
“deposit on potential acquisition,” and the common stock as “contingent common stock” as the transaction
is contingent upon regulatory approval (see the following paragraph). The shares were valued at $.0023 per share. The deposit on
potential acquisition has been moved to non-current assets as of December 31, 2016, due to the uncertainty of the timing of the
second closing as noted below.

 

The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH
for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority
in the United Kingdom (“London FCA”) and from the regulators in Cyprus (‘second closing’). The second closing
is subject to the Company signing an option agreement with FML Malta and FXDD Trading Limited, providing that the Company may acquire
both entities for $1. The terms of the Agreement stipulated that if the second does not occur before November 28, 2016, the $1,000,000
will be returned to the Company and the first closing will be unwound. As a result of the first closing being contingent on the
second closing, the 24,156,000 shares for the purchase of IBIH was recorded as contingent common stock, due to the uncertainty
of the closing of the transaction. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory authority (“CYSEC”) granted all
regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to be consummated. Thereafter, additional submissions were made to the London
FCA to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Then, in December of 2016, the parties
agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will be amending the SPA to reflect that no regulatory
approval would be needed to complete the second closing, based on further contemplated changes to the transaction structure. The
amended SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second closing.
  
The Company agreed to sell to CMH 30,900,000 shares of common stock
and 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for $2,000,000 in two equal installments. The first close occurred on June 7, 2016.
The second close will occur with the closing of the Company’s acquisition of IBIH.
 

 F-9 
 

  
The Series A preferred stock has the following key terms:
 

1)A stated value of $10 per share


2)The holder is entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 1.5% of stated value payable semi-annually on June 30
and December 31.


3)The preferred stock must be redeemed at the stated value plus any unpaid dividends in 5 years. The Company has a choice of
redeeming either in cash or in shares of common stock based on a formula in the certificate of designation. The conversion price
has a floor of $0.20 per share.
 
During the first close, 15,450,000 shares of common stock
and 100,000 shares of Series A preferred stock were issued and were recorded as equity and as a long-term liability, respectively.
The $1,000,000 of proceeds received was allocated to the common stock and Series A preferred stock according to their relative
fair values determined at the time of issuance, and as a result, the Company recorded a discount on the Series A preferred stock,
which is being amortized to interest expense to the date of redemption. The terms of the Series A preferred stock issued represent
mandatory redeemable shares, with a fixed redemption date (in 5 years) and the Company has a choice of redeeming the instrument
either in cash or a variable number of shares of common stock. As such, all dividends accrued and/or paid and any accretions are
classified as part of interest expense.
 
4. Related-Party Transactions
 
On May 23, 2016, the Company engaged Bentley
to act as the Company’s exclusive financial advisor (the “Bentley Engagement”) in connection with the IronFX
transaction related to the SPA in consideration of a transaction fee equal to approximately $600,000 in cash and stock of the Company
(the “Transaction Fee”). This transaction fee is payable upon the consummation of the IronFX transaction. As part of
the Bentley Engagement, Mr. Craig Marshak, a director, acted as a sub-advisor to Bentley and is entitled to a portion of the Transaction
Fee. The Company has not paid or recorded any fees as of December 31, 2016 in connection with the Bentley Engagement, as the Transaction
Fee is a contingent liability and will recorded upon consummation of the related transaction.
 
Nukkleus agreed to retain Craig Marshak, a principal of Triple Eight
Markets, for a term of 18 months with a monthly fee of $7,000 to act as a business and financial advisor. Under this agreement
and as compensation for other services provided, the Company has paid Triple Eight Markets a total of $50,000 for the period ended
December 31, 2016.
 
Nukkleus uses affiliate employees for various services such as the
use of accountants to record the books and accounts of the Company at no charge to those affiliates. Also, the Company uses office
space of affiliate companies, free of rent.
  
On May 24, 2016, the Company acquired selected technology assets
from CMH. These assets were originally acquired by CMH from Forexware, LLC and FXDirect. All of these entities are related companies
through common control. CMH agreed to permit Forexware, LLC and FXDirect a perpetual, irrevocable, non-assignable (except for such
assignments resulting from a merger and/or acquisition), royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide non-exclusive, limited license
to the Intellectual Property. As the acquisition was from an entity under common control, the Company recorded these assets at
CMH’s carrying values, which were zero.

 
On May 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Global Service Agreement
with FXDD Trading Limited. This service agreement was replaced by one with FML Malta, with substantially the same terms. The Company
is to invoice FML Malta Ltd, a minimum of $2,000,000 per month in consideration for providing personnel and technical support,
marketing, accounting, risk monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and support.

 
In addition, the Company entered into a Global Service Agreement
with FXDIRECT to pay a minimum of $1,975,000 per month for receiving personnel and technical support, marketing, accounting, risk
monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and support.
 

 F-10 
 

  
Nukkleus can generate revenues/expenses in excess of $2 million/$1.975
million per month but in no event shall it be less than those amounts. FML Malta made direct payments to FXDIRECT in satisfaction
of the amounts due Nukkleus, resulting in a receivable of $196,250, as of December 31, 2016
 
Both of the above entities are affiliates through common ownership.
As of December 31, 2016, the amount due from/to a related party is as follows:

·the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.
 
These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as
such because the context of the statement will include words such as we “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,”

to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements.  The forward-looking statements included herein are only made as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect
our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
 
Overview
 
The management of the Company has stated that the acquisition of
a 9.9% shareholder stake in IBIH, as well as the acquisition of the operations of IronFX and GVS Ltd. is just a first intended
step towards the Company’s long term strategy of identifying leading retail forex brands from around the world as well as
leading financial companies related to the industry, which can potentially be included and synergistically folded into the Company.
It is the stated intention of the Company’s management to maintain the separate brand identity, operational autonomy, and
segregated customer deposits for each individual retail forex brand it may potentially acquire in the future, while simultaneously
capitalizing on efficiencies afforded by scale, shared backbones and optimized regulatory capital structure.
 
As a result of these above described transactions, which were entered
in May 2016, as well as further contemplated transactions, the Company’s goal is to create an industry leading sector consolidated
platform, combining strong global retail and institutional trading flows covering FX, commodities, futures, CFD and equities, with
a cutting edge technological product suite, turnkey software and technological development capabilities. These contemplated transactions
could potentially result in a global financial trading and financial technology group, with operations and clients, as well as
one of the most comprehensive regulatory licenses coverage in the world.
 

The Company agreed to acquire the remaining 20,000 shares of IBIH
for 219,844,000 shares of its common stock, subject to IBIH obtaining regulatory approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority
in the United Kingdom and from the regulators in Cyprus (‘second closing’). The second closing is subject to the Company
signing an option agreement with FML Malta, Ltd and FXDD Trading Limited, providing that the Company may acquire both entities
for $1. The terms of the Agreement stipulated that if the second does not occur before November 28, 2016, the $1,000,000 will be
returned to the Company and the first closing will be unwound. Prior to November 28, 2016, the Cyprus regulatory authority (“CYSEC”)
granted all regulatory approvals for the transaction with Nukkleus to be consummated. Thereafter, additional submissions were made
to the London FCA to commence the regulatory approval process in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Then, in December of 2016,
the parties agreed to suspend the request for regulatory approval by the London FCA, and will be amending the SPA to reflect that
no regulatory approval would be needed to complete the second closing, based on further contemplated changes to the transaction
structure. The amended SPA will also reflect that there will be no firm date to complete the second closing.

Results of Operations
 
Summary of Key Results
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus December
31, 2015
 
Revenues and Cost of Revenues
 
Total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus
December 31, 2015 were $6,000,000 and $0 respectively. Revenues are from general support services rendered to a related party. The
significant increase is due to revenues derived from the service agreement entered in May, 2016. No such agreement was in place
as of December 31, 2015.
 
Costs of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 versus
December 31, 2015 were $5,925,000 and $0, respectively.   Cost of revenue represents amount incurred for general
support services rendered by a related party.  The significant increase in costs was due to expenses incurred as a result
of the Global Services Agreement entered in May 2016. No such agreement existed as of December 31, 2015.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31,
2016 versus December 31, 2015, were $121,505 versus $0, respectively.   These amounts were primarily third party
professional fees.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
At December 31, 2016, we had cash of $0.
 

We had a total stockholders’ deficit of ($288,920) and an
accumulated deficit of ($431,144) as of December 31, 2016.
 
The Company does not have an operating bank account. All
expenses are paid by an affiliate. There were no investing or financing activities for the three months ended December 31,
2016.
 

 5 
 

  
Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers, directors and their affiliates will be entered
into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders,
or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate
review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis.
 
With respect to shares issued for services,
the shares authorized to be issued by the board of directors are recorded at the fair value of the services received, or the fair
value of the shares, whichever is more reliably measureable.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We had no outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance
sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving
non-exchange traded contracts.
 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk
 
Not applicable to a “smaller reporting company” as defined
in Item 10(f)(1) of SEC Regulation S-K.
 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible
for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company.
 
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures
 

In connection with the preparation of our Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) as of
December 31, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The CEO and the CFO is the same person. During the evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operations of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Section 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) for our Company. Our sole officer and director, who is chief executive
officer and is also acting in the capacity of principal accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the design and
operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on the
criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. As a result of this evaluation, we concluded that our financial reporting controls and procedures were
not effective for the period ended December 31, 2016. Due to its small size and limited financial resources, the Company has
only one employee involved in accounting and financial reporting. As a result, there is no segregation of duties within the
accounting function, leaving all aspects of financial control and physical control of cash in the hands of the same employee.
In addition, our deficiencies also include a lack of timely financial statement preparation and account reconciliations, as
well as, and as a result of limited financial resources, the ability to retain personnel with sufficient technical expertise
regarding accounting for certain equity-based transactions. The CEO is currently working to retain a full-time CFO and to put
it in place  adequate levels of controls to provide for greater segregation of duties. There is no CFO at this time, however,
and the CEO is also acting in the capacity of Chief Accounting Officer.

 
(b) Changes in the Company’s
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
 
Other than described above, there have been no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Item 5. Other

View Nukkleus Inc. Quartely report 1/2017 SEC Filing for free. The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
