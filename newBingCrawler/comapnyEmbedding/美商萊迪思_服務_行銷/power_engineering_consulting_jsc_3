  GYPSUM PLANT FOR TPP MARITSA EAST 3    In compliance with the ecological development program of Enel Maritsa East 3, TOTEMA Engineering has started the designing, building and commissioning of Gypsum Dewatering Plant on the site of the power plant. Gypsum is a residual product, formed as a result of the flue gases desulfurization. The gypsum slurry, received from the Sulfur Purifying Installations with 50 % solid fraction content is fed to the plant along piping with approximate length 500 meters. During the transportation strict limitations shall be observed regarding the temperature and speed of the slurry with the purpose of preservation the quality of the end product. The water is removed from the gypsum with the help of a vacuum technology with use of belt filters, after which the already dried gypsum with 10 % humidity content, enters to a store for further transportation. The water, removed during this process, is returned back to the Sulfur Purifying Installation to be reused. The technological process is fully automated and upon normal operation there is no need of any operational staff to monitor it. The output of the plant is 320 tones dried gypsum per hour, which makes it the biggest Gypsum Dewatering Plant in Bulgaria.   Approximately 300 employees for 18 months work for the design and building of the plant.   About 900 tones steel structure and approximately 7 000 м3 concrete will be used for the building of the plant.   The equipment is delivered by worldly known companies as: RPA, NASH, Munsh, Habermann, Siemen, etc.      Fig. 2.2.1 Diagram of the main piping in the plant        Fig. 2.2.2
