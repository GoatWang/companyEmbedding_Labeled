 Download as PDF

September 16, 2015


VSE to expand technical, maintenance and test support for the U.S.
      Marine Corps

    ALEXANDRIA, Va.--
      VSE Corporation (NASDAQ: VSEC) was recently awarded a Firm Fixed Price
      (FFP) task order under its SeaPort-e contract vehicle to support the
      U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico, VA. This task order has a
      period of performance that includes a six-month base period and four
      one-year options with a total value of $37M. This award represents an
      increase in contract value, scope, and capabilities to work currently
      performed by VSE.
    

      Under this task order VSE will provide program management, engineering
      technical support, maintenance services, test and evaluation, logistics
      support, and vehicle and equipment storage for the USMC Product Manager
      Assault Amphibious Vehicles (PdM AAV) for the Equipment Maintenance Test
      Support (EMTS) Program. Throughout the period of performance, VSE will
      support the Product Manager (PdM) for the AAV test vehicles located at
      our AAV Maintenance Facility at Green Road, Ruther Glen, VA and multiple
      CONUS and OCONUS locations. Maintaining and testing the PdM AAV vehicles
      is the first step in moderizing the AAV Family of Vehicles (FOV) since
      the Marine Corps has extended the service life of the AAV to 2035.
    

      “For nearly two decades, we have provided comprehensive maintenance
      support for the USMC amphibious assault vehicles,” said Federal Services
      Group President J.R. Brown. “Our program manager, maintenance supervisor
      and mechanics, engineers, vehicle operators and field service
      technicians bring expertise, experience, and a level of detailed
      knowledge that will continue to keep these vehicles in the highest state
      of operational readiness for testing and demonstrations throughout their
      service life. Our number one goal is to ensure that our nation’s first
      line of defense is fully supported to accomplish their mission.”

 ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System (QMS)
ISO 9001 is an internationally recognized model for a Quality Management System (QMS). The management system approach to running a business involves institutionalizing the best practices (processes) that are derived and updated through continuous process improvement. ISO 9001 is used by organizations (both manufacturing and service) to certify that their QMS is capable of meeting customer requirements from initial design and development through production, installation, and servicing. 
The ISO 9001 standard provides VSE the means to manage our internal processes in conformance to established business and various contract requirements. The processes themselves become the key element in the entire QMS. In the old days, if a product was “handmade” it implied quality and that quality was obtained through caring, experienced workers. Today the process, which includes experienced workers among other elements, controls the quality of the product. Control of the process is gained through improvements based on knowledge rather than intuition. Product/service quality is obtained by designing processes that are known to produce a product or service that meets or exceeds the customer’s requirements. Product/service quality is maintained and improved by constantly and continuously upgrading the existing processes. 
VSE Corporation has been an ISO 9001 registered company since January, 1999. Our third-party registrar is LRQA Inc. VSE maintains a certified Quality Management System (QMS) that is subject to audit every 6 months by LRQA to ensure continued compliance in addition to continuous internal audits. The registered divisions and work sites of VSE are listed on the current copy of our ISO 9001 certification.

Wheeler Bros., Inc., maintains a Quality Management System (QMS) that is scheduled to be audited by PRI at 6 month intervals which ensures our continued compliance with ISO 9001:2015, including, but not limited to internal quality audits.  We are a Pennsylvania based corporation engaged in the manufacturing, engineering, inventory management and distribution of automotive, truck, heavy equipment, industrial parts and supplies to the United States Postal Service, Department of Defense, other Government agencies and commercial fleets.  Located in Somerset, we were incorporated in 1960 as a local parts supplier and auto-electrical repair shop servicing the Pennsylvania Turnpike and local trade area.
