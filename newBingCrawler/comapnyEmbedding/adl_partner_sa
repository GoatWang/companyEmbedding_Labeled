In 2015, we're proud to say the finest autoloaders in the world aren't made in Italy, Belgium or Japan. They're built right here in America.















A backcountry rifle requires a stock that is not just lightweight, but also extremely rigid and durable. Those criteria led us to Manners' Elite Hunter Series. Jason Hairston's desire for the stock to be as sleek and streamlined as possible led us to the EH8. With its carbon-fiber frame, super-light filler, and no-frills design, it embodies every characteristic we sought. 

A hand-laid bedding job, applied by Custom Shop gunsmith Brian Smith, further accurizes the rifle by providing a rock-solid foundation. A nails-tough KUIU Vias Cerakote paint job provides the eye candy.

What's in YOUR Easter basket? #happyeaster #thankyoueasterbunny #remingtonammo #R51

3 months ago














Here's something you won't see on an assembly line. Custom Shop gunsmith, Brian Smith (real name), solders the handle to the bolt of the Ultimate Sheep Rifle after it was removed to mill space for an M-16 extractor and to drill a second ejector hole in the face. 

After soldering, three tapered pins are inserted to further cement the connection. With those pins in place, it will be virtually impossible to break the handle off the bolt. It's one more thing that makes a Custom Shop rifle truly custom.

ADLPartner: EARNINGS GROWTH FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2014 Paris, 28 August 2014 (5:45 pm) - ADLPartner is releasing its consolidated earnings for the first half of 2014: operating income totaled €7.1 million, representing 12.3% of net sales, while net income (group share) came to €6.0 million. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS The gross sales volumei:#_edn1 climbed 2.7% compared with the first half of 2013 to €138.8 million, with €57.5 million in net salesii:#_edn2, up 3.7% on the previous year. In a relatively unfavorable economic environment, ADLPartner has continued to optimize its prospecting campaigns. The growth in net sales over the half-year period is partly linked to the results of a new marketing mix for the open-ended subscription range.  Alongside this, ADLPartner has continued moving forward with the diversification of its business into digital marketing.  CHANGE IN PROFITABILITY Operating income came to €7.1 million, giving an operating margin rate of 12.3%, compared with 10.2% for the first half of 2013. This improvement primarily reflects the change in the product mix, focusing on open-ended subscriptions, supported by the new marketing mix rolled out for this range. Net income from continuing operations came to €6.6 million, compared with €3.8 million for the first half of 2013, with this increase benefiting from a non-recurring reduction in the tax expense: -€0.6 million, versus -€2.0 million the previous year. Net income after tax from discontinued operations or operations held for sale represented -€0.6 million, compared with -€1.1 million for the first half of 2013. After factoring in minority interests, net income (group share) came to €6.0 million, compared with €2.8 million for the first half of 2013.   Consolidated data (€ million)  H1 2014  H1 2013restated[1]:#_ftn1  Net sales  57.47  55.42  Operating income% of net sales  7.0712.3%  5.6510.2%  Income from continuing operations% of net sales  6.5811.4%  3.826.9%  Net income from held-for-sale or discontinued operations  (0.60)  (1.09)  Net income (group share) % of net sales  5.9810.4%  2.765.0%  FINANCIAL STRUCTURE The Group's shareholders' equity represented €21.0 million at 30 June 2014, up €2.8 million in relation to 31 December 2013, after taking into account half-year earnings and the ordinary dividend paid out. The Group's cash position remains strong, with €22.7 million at 30 June 2014, compared with €27.2 million at 31 December 2013 and €23.5 million at 30 June 2013. Net asset valueiii:#_edn3 (group share), calculated based on shareholders' equity and the value of the active open-ended subscription portfolio, came to €117.2 million at 30 June 2014 (€29.54 per share excluding treasury stock), compared with €118.4 million at 31 December 2013.  OUTLOOK ADLPartner is rolling out a strategy to expand its business and create value through its know-how. This strategy is contributing towards further strengthening positions on its longstanding business lines, while also developing new sources of growth. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The management board approved the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2014 during its meeting on 20 August 2014. On 27 August 2014, the supervisory board confirmed that it did not have any observations to make concerning the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2014.

It was coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992. Martin Fowler describes the technical-debt metaphor this way:In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the fo⋯⋯rm of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice. We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay down the principal by refactoring the quick and dirty design into the better design. In this session, Patrick Smacchia, creator of the tool static analyzer NDepend that is Microsoft Visual Studio Partner, will explain how Technical Debt should be handled both in the IDE and in the DevOps, The goal is to make Code Quality an integral part of development process with no major upfront cost. Architecture A code-centric discussion on building a framework for an enterprise application, using an "onion"-style architecture. Light on diagrams, heavy on demos, this presentation will show how we can tie together some really handy open source libraries to form a framework which lends itself to writing maintainable, production-grade code. Such libraries include FluentValidation, Automapper, log4net, MediatR, SimpleInjector and (of course) JSON.NET. The focus of the talk will be on the server (ASP.NET - but not Core), although I will touch on some client-side stuff. But a comprehensive discussion of the client-side aspects would be a whole presentation in and of itself.

Basarat Ali Syed on TypeScript and more news on VS Team Services (with some give-aways thanks to the VSTS Team in the US) Types can help you understand and document your code. When was the last time you saw JavaScript documentation that didn’t mention the *types* for function arguments / return values? Why have this information separated from the implementation? Type information is awesome if you think about it: A single type annotation for a function is a theorem and the function body is the proof. And now you can have type annotations for your JavaScript. Introducing TypeScript. It adds Types and brings in ES6/ES7 features.
