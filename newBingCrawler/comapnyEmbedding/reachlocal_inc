ReachLocal Makes Online Brand Building Easier for Local Advertisers with Launch of ReachDisplay™
ReachDisplay™ is the Next Iteration in ReachLocal's Integrated Advertising Service That Allows SMBs and National Brands to Use Search and Display Campaigns in Tandem to More Robustly Acquire Qualified Consumers Through One Platform.

February 18, 2009
(Woodland Hills, Calif.) ReachLocal Inc. (http://www.reachlocal.com), a leading global provider of local online marketing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and national brands, announced today the release of ReachDisplay™ - an online display and brand building product that employs remarketing and optimization to make customer acquisition for local advertisers a better value. The product joins ReachLocal's premiere suite of solutions for advertisers that include its pioneering search advertising product, ReachSearch™, and its online marketing tracking and analytics product, TotalTrack™.
	
							ReachDisplay™ delivers for local advertisers relevant and targeted online visual display ads on multiple Web sites viewed by consumers in the advertiser's service area, and allows them to target consumers geographically (DMA, city, and radius-targeting supported), demographically and contextually (keyword and category-targeting supported).  ReachDisplay™ features remarketing capabilities so advertisers can serve specifically targeted ads directly to consumers who have previously interacted with their Web site.  Furthermore, ReachDisplay™ works in tandem with ReachSearch™ by allowing advertisers to specifically target ads to those customers who had previously searched for their business online. 

							"Consumers continue to move their media usage online from offline. As local advertisers used ReachSearch™ to shift their ad spend from print directories to online search, ReachDisplay™ gives them that same ease, flexibility and transparency to migrate online the customer outreach and brand building they have historically done through offline media like newspapers and print," said Zorik Gordon, ReachLocal Co-Founder and CEO.  "Through our integrated solutions, ReachLocal is able to strategically deliver these local search and display ads with precision, which is a tremendous value for local advertisers who demand efficiency and a return on investment." 

							Through ReachLocal's integrated online advertising platform, ReachDisplay™ offers real-time optimization of publisher selection, ad placement, and creative bidding based on performance data. By logging into their accounts, local advertisers are able to view the performance of their ReachDisplay™, ReachSearch™ and TotalTrack™ campaigns to obtain a complete view of their online marketing efforts. 

							With over 30 offices located in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, ReachLocal provides the ultimate Internet marketing solution for SMBs through its patent-pending technology and a proprietary team of Internet Marketing Consultants (IMCs) who are highly trained to consult with SMBs on all their offline and online marketing initiatives. 

							ReachLocal® is a registered trademark and ReachSearch™, ReachDisplay™, TotalTrack™ are trademarks of ReachLocal Inc.

We love IPOs
The IPO market provides a magical window into the most exciting technologies, emerging consumer trends and important business developments - all testing their mettle in the crucible of the public markets. We are constantly learning and researching to deliver the best insights available.
