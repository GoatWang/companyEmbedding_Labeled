The way people pay for goods and services is continually changing. That’s why today’s businesses should have a payment processing partner that can provide high-quality services, products and customer care. 
                        Unlike other mobile payment solutions that hold funds for up to 30 days, Heartland funds its merchants as if they are processing transactions in a store, so you’ll receive your funds faster.
                    












Security 


                    Customers work with businesses they trust. Ensure your credit and debit card processing is safe and reliable with our secure, mobile payment processing. In addition, we offer transparent Interchange Plus pricing, which allows you full disclosure into how much you’re paying us—and how much goes to the card brands.
                









































How to Download the App 


To begin accepting mobile payments, download Heartland Mobile Payments directly from Apple iTunes, Apple App Store or Google Play store. Existing merchants must contact Heartland at 1-888-963-3600 to receive gateway credentials to begin quickly processing mobile payments as well as order the optional encrypting reader. You may elect to hand-key card data as opposed to paying for the reader to swipe the cards. New merchants must be set up for Heartland card processing in order to use Heartland Mobile Payments and will go through the same streamlined underwriting process as a traditional card merchant. During the application process with your Heartland relationship manager, you can also elect to order the Heartland Mobile Payments encrypting reader. Just as it’s done for existing merchants, the specialty product team will email the gateway credentials to you after application approval and will ensure the encrypting reader is shipped to you if applicable.

Secure. Reliable. Cost-effective.

A point-of-sale solution should be all of these and scalable to your needs. 
Your business is unique, so we offer customized, versatile and comprehensive systems designed to grow as your company does. With Heartland, your POS becomes the center of your commerce—allowing you to integrate with your other applications, such as payroll, and marketing and loyalty programs.
Most importantly, we offer our proprietary POS security technology to provide you with unparalleled protection.












Why It’s Best to be Out-of-Scope

                        Heartland’s “Out of Scope” solution takes the POS system completely out of the payment authorization process… keeping card data secure. Learn more about this solution by watching this video.

Software 


                    Innovative POS software is at the core of Heartland Commerce. Our priority is to provide software that makes running your business easier—and more efficient. With Heartland’s POS software, you can:

Bring your store online
Track inventory and reduce theft
Attract more customers and build loyalty with marketing and rewards programs

Hardware 


                    Secure, PCI-compliant hardware is vital to an effective POS system. Heartland partners with quality terminal manufacturers to provide you with options designed to fit your budget and POS hardware system needs.
                
















Tablet-Based 


                    Accepting mobile payments is convenient for your customers—and you. Turn a tablet or smartphone into a terminal with Heartland’s mobile POS system. Our tablet-based point-of-sale systems come with all the features of traditional POS software. Quickly and securely process customer transactions, accurately track sales and inventory, optimize employee labor and create detailed business reports—all from a mobile device. Mobile POS terminals offer several advantages:

Small footprint suited for businesses with limited workspace
Intuitive design that reduces training and support time
Easily integrates with traditional PC-based POS systems
Available with a variety of flexible purchase or rental options
Ideal for applications such as line busting, remote sales and more where mobility is a requirement.

Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. was a Fortune 1000 U.S.-based payment processing and technology provider. Founded by Robert O. Carr in 1997, Heartland Payment Systems is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.
Heartland Payment Systems provides payment processing for more than 275,000 business locations in the United States and processes more than 11 million transactions a day and more than $80 billion in transactions a year.[2] In 2014, the Nilson Report ranked Heartland the 6th largest payment processor in the country by transaction count, and the 8th largest by processed dollar volume.[4] On April 25, 2016, the company tweeted an announcement that it had successfully completed a merger with Global Payments Systems.[5]. This wrapped up a process which began with the announcement of Global Payments to acquire the company in December 2015, for $3.5 billion;[6] the transaction was completed in 2016.

Associated businesses[edit]
In addition to payment processing, Heartland has developed or acquired businesses in payroll processing, gift card and campus card solutions, point of sale systems, school payments and nutrition, network management, mobile payments and ordering, ecommerce, billing solutions, and lending services. Merger with Global Payments Inc. was completed in April 2016 - now publicly traded as NYSE:GPN.[3]
Historical Highlights[edit]
Heartland processed its first card transaction on July 15, 1997. In 2001 the company received a $40 million private equity investment from Greenhill Capital Partners, L.P. (New York, NY), LLR Partners, Inc. (Philadelphia, PA), and their affiliated investment funds.[4] The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange on August 11, 2005. On May 17, 2010, Heartland announced its debut on the list of America’s largest companies at #954.[5]
Security breach[edit]
See also: Albert Gonzalez § Heartland Payment Systems
On January 20, 2009 Heartland announced that it had been "the victim of a security breach within its processing system in 2008".[6] The data stolen included the digital information encoded onto the magnetic stripe built into the backs of credit and debit cards; with that data, thieves can fashion counterfeit credit cards by imprinting the same stolen information onto fabricated cards.[7] One estimate claimed 100 million cards and more than 650 financial services companies were compromised; at the time, it was characterized as the largest ever criminal breach of card data.[8]
An American computer hacker, Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in March 2010 to 20 years in prison for his role in the hacking ring that broke into the Heartland computer systems.[9]
On May 1, 2009, Visa and Heartland issued a statement that Heartland successfully validated its compliance with PCI DSS and was returned to Visa's list of PCI DSS Validated Service Providers.[10]
End-to-End Encryption[edit]
On May 24, 2009, Heartland commercially launched their E3 solution, an end-to-end encryption technology designed to safeguard credit and debit card account information from the moment of card swipe and through the Heartland network.[11] Several days later, on May 8, 2009, Gartner Analyst Avivah Litan stated that Heartland "is basically leading the way for the rest of the industry." She also characterized its plan for end-to-end encryption as the first effort of its kind in the US.[12]
Other processors including Worldpay US and several First Data ISO's announced end-to-end encryption initiatives soon after Heartland announced theirs.[5][13]
Open letter to the Electronic Payments Industry[edit]
Following a keynote address to the Strategic Leadership Forum of the Electronic Transactions Association in October 2013, Heartland CEO Bob Carr published an open letter to the electronic payment processing industry urging an end to unethical, dishonest and illegal pricing practices, referencing the practice of deliberately falsifying interchange rates, deliberately falsifying merchant category codes (MCC), and the use of confusing small print to extort large fines from merchants.[14]
Litigation against Mercury Payment Systems[edit]
In January 2014, Heartland filed a lawsuit against the company Mercury Payment Systems, an electronic payment provider, for alleged false advertising and "other deceptive trade practices".[15] The lawsuit concerns interchange fees charged by credit card networks and alleges violations of the Lanham Act and state laws.[16]
Heartland Secure[edit]
In May 2014, Heartland Secure is launched. Backed by a breach warranty, Heartland Secure combines three technologies to provide merchants with security and guard against monetization of stolen card data.
Merger With Global Payments[edit]
In April 2016, Heartland and Global Payments completed their merger agreement. The combined company, Global Payments Inc., is publicly traded (NYSE: GPN), has more than 8,500 employees worldwide and provides market-leading payments solutions to nearly 2.5 million merchants in 29 countries globally.[17]

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/27/2004
            

                BBB has determined that Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                        Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 3 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
