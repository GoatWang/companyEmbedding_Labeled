Tim Ferriss is no stranger to manufacturing and prototyping products. Before he started writing books, Ferriss built companies. One of his first ventures, BrainQUICKEN, took two weeks and $5,000 to launch. This sports nutrition ecommerce store quickly grew to $40,000 a month business.

We asked Ferriss for his best advice on how to prototype and manufacture a product. Here's what he had to say. 



 Tips on Manufacturing a Product
1. Think Outside of Google
Google is great for finding manufacturers, but it shouldn't be your only source. Also check out trade magazines, and find trade shows that are dedicated to the industry you're getting into. At trade shows, you'll find all the reputable manufacturers and distributors under one roof. Also check out the well known Alibaba, and ThomasNet (Thomas' Register of Manufacturers).
2. Submit Lots of Proposals
Once you find a bunch of manufacturers, put out a proposal to all of them. Let them know you're contacting all the others. Now, chances are you don't be able to impress them with the amount of capital you have to invest in a first run, so it's important to tell them your marketing and business plan. Include how much volume you'll be capable to bring to the table if the first run is a success. Read The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing to help you with your pitch.
3. Hunt Down the Scams and Fraudsters
Do your due diligence. Take the manufacturers name and research their reputation. Try typing their name into google with "fraud" and "scam" after it to see if anything pops up. Do the same with the principals of the business. Find out who the lead executives are and search their names with "lawsuit" and "FTC" after their name.
4. Don't Judge a Book by the Cover
Manufacturer websites are notoriously poorly designed, but that doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the company or the products. 
Tips on Prototyping a Product

1. Define What Type of Prototype you Need
It's vitally important to determine the objective of your prototype. 



Is it for you to assess the manufacturing?
Is it to sell perspective clients?
Is it to test or sell on Kickstarter?



2. Don't Spend Too Much Money
One of Tim's friends has made millions of dollars selling various licenses. He didn't spend tons of money to develop beautiful prototypes, in fact, most of them were made from paper and cardboard. 
3. Hire a Firm, Use 3D Printing
If you require a more professional or intricate prototype, find an industrial design firm in your city. They'll put something together and using a 3D printer will develop a prototype for you. Or - even use your own 3D Printer, like the MakerBot that's pictured above.
4. Manufacture in Small Batches
Only manufacture in small batches until you have proven you can fill the demand and acquire customers profitably. You don't want to end up with inventory you can't move. Also keep in mind that most people tweak their product and it's packaging along the way. It's important to be able to pivot and change without having to throw out a whole bunch of units.

All very good tips on manufacturing and prototyping your physical product.
I find these days, the step of 3D printing a prototype is almost a must – simply the best way to get your concept into your hands and test the fit, form, and appearance – even if it’s not totally full-functioning.
Also, I think having a design on your side can always help.  Yes it is expensive if they run through the entire process for you.
But if you already have your concept scratched down on a napkin, then for them to convert to a 3D model for printing is not very expensive.  It’s even cheaper if you can find an engineering/design student or virtual contractor (i.e. on Odesk).  I’ve successfully worked with a number of contractors on there.
I also agree with small-batch manufacturing to start – Instead of immediately spending thousands of dollars on plastic injection or die-cast molds in China, have a domestic manufacturer or machine shop make the first hundred units for you.  You may not actually profit much at this time, buu you keep your upfront costs low and you build relationships for future prototyping and manufacturing.  Plus it’s always nice to attempt to make domestic manufacture viable.
Thanks,

I remember when I first started my business 30 years ago. Unfortunately, the company is not here today, but prototyping the product was one of the most difficult parts at the beginning. After the product was ready it was much easier to market and receive support.  http://www.nwpaperbox.com/?page_id=703

Whenever I thought of prototypes, I always imagined drawings of different products. I didn’t think that people tried to make them until the prototype was completely finished. Now that I think about it, it would make more sense to make different versions of the product until you found the one that works the best.

I am reinventing a product, or rather, changing the use of a current product that is already well known in the sewing, fabrics, and arts and crafts industry.  Would that product that is well known for its current use be a valid prototype for my own product?  In other words, can I present the current product as it is today to manufacturers and just say that I’d like to recondition its current use to the one I have in mind? I don’t want to reinvent the wheel if it’s already half way there.

I have a product in mind that I already have a image of, that everyone who has a home can benefit from having one or two of these. I am not one who have a lot of money but I have a great product that need to be on the market and I am sure it will make someone and myself very wealthy.

I know about the difficulties in the relationship myself with Chinese suppliers. I am British myself, married with a Chinese girl here in Ningbo China. I’m part of an international trading company which helps people interested in this article in helping them find suppliers. I have made several connections with manufacturers, especially with stationery and cleaning products etc. If you are interested in importing such products from China, don’t hesitate to contact me kevin.w@hotmail.co.uk.

Good advice. I actually build and design prototypes for individuals as well as companies.
I find most are looking for a finished product in the prototype stage. The prototype stage is import and you should not just pay big dollars to get a final product made without testing. It is best to start with a less expensive and flexible design. Because you WILL “tweek” your product as it develops into a final design for the consumer.

I have an idea for a product that can be used globally and the market for it is vast - I’m talking instant millionaire !! I’m doing my research and the 2 main issues facing me are patents and prototyping. The product will sell itself. If anyone is intersted in learning more please contact me at happydadof2@yahoo.com be sure to mention your interest.

Hey guys,
Thought I might get help here. Could you please advise me on where can I find good quality engineering advice/consulting for my product ideas? I have zero experience in engineering, so it’s hard for me to check feasibility of my ideas.
Should I get a freelancer or are there good companies from your experience who can help with that?
Please email me if you have any thoughts on tbaghirli@gmail.com
Thank you very much,
Tim

Thank you for the great tips.
I have one more question though… who do you suggest I contact if I have an idea that involves technology? the same industrial engineer? I have the idea but I don’t know if it is technologically possible. 
Thank you again!

I have 2 patents for innovative tables, and the goal is to procure licensing deals for both designs since I have no capital to invest in inventory.  While I have fantastic narrated 3D virtual renderings on video to present, most of the big trade shows will not sell a booth if there is no physical product to display.  So I am looking for someone who can create product samples for each.  I got one bid from a company and it was $40,000 for both.  If anyone can recommend other prototype companies please let me know!

I have a provisional patent on a simple plastic hair accessory.  Have a 3D prototype done, need to start manufacturing with a first run of 1,000 to test.  Any recommendations for manufacturers here in the US?  This is definitely a product that will sell itself once it is known….then will need China manufacturer for mass production.  Any investors welcome to contact me.  jmb1666@live.com

I am a US based (Minnesota) product developer/ sourcing agent. I generally help small companies in the US and Canada finalize their concept into prototype and then redesign for cost savings before finding one of the lowest cost suppliers in the world that still has good quality.
Right now I have some free time. If you have a product you need help with, I might be able to help. Let me know if you are interested.

I’ve always wondered what steps go into making a product. It makes sense that someone would want to have their prototypes made professionally! That way it would at least look appealing. http://www.hillsplastic.com.au/our-fabrication/

Intro Text
Proto® is built beyond strong.
Proto® tools are precision engineered to give you more than just power.
 
Proto®’s tools work like you do. Not just hard and strong, but, smarter and safer, too.
 
Proto® tools are heat forged and nickel-plated, making them tough enough to withstand even the most demanding work environment, from the blast of zero-degree temperatures to the rapid fire pace of the factory floor.
 
At Proto®, we’re safety obsessed, so every tool has gone through rigorous testing to ensure it won’t fail on the job. Plus, they’re ergonomically designed with handles that give you a firm grip and special features that prevent slippage. 

Please visit Proto literature page for more information on our products. Find the right tool for your job.
