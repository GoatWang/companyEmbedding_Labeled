History[edit]
Founded in 2002 as Xten, the company was an early influencer of SIP standards through the IETF and launched their first commercial product, the X-PRO SIP softphone in 2003.[2][3] The company changed its name in 2005 to CounterPath Solutions, then again in 2007 to CounterPath Corporation. CounterPath sells and markets its products through channel partners, direct sales and its online store to businesses. Their flagship product is the Bria softphone, a client suite that offers over-the-top unified communications across fixed and mobile networks.[4] The company claims that their freeware product, X-Lite, has been downloaded by millions of users.[5] Service provider customers include AT&T, Avaya, BroadSoft, Cisco Systems, Comcast, Ericsson, GENBAND, Rogers Communications and Verizon.[6] The company also holds several patents for VoIP, FMC and Unified Communications technologies.[7]
Management[edit]
CounterPath’s executive team is led by President and CEO Donovan Jones and governed by a Board of Directors.[8] The Chairman of the Board is Terry Matthews, co-founder of Mitel. He is also the founder and Chairman of Wesley Clover, a private investment vehicle and holding company.
Acquisitions[edit]
CounterPath acquired three companies since its inception:

February 2008: BridgePort Networks [9]
August 2007: NewHeights Software [10]
February 2008: FirstHand Technologies [11]
