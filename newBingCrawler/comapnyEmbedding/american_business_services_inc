      What our clients are saying:    













Over the past several years I have become well acquainted with American Business. I have come to learn their business values. For them it is all about their clients. They truly believe the client comes first. When the client has the best possible solution it is a win for everyone involved. The ethical values American Business puts forth supersedes any business provider I have ever experienced. Working with AB has and always is a privilege. Watching the extreme care AB advisors put into every client need is so refreshing. They never stop short of every effort required to meet the complex needs of so many clients. American Business truly believes it's a privilege to be serving their clients. They are smart, diligent, creative and extremely careful in dealing with client problems and issues. 



- Jay N. Nisberg, PhD 















American Business combines the highest level of technical expertise with creative, imaginative problem-solving and an unwavering dedication to the client's best interests. It has been an invaluable resource to my firm and my clients. 



- G. Warren Whitaker, Esq, Day Pitney 















Through our partnership with American Business, we are able to make the complex world of personal risk management simple for our advisors, their clients and families.  American Business provides unique, advanced life insurance solutions that differentiates our practice.  Our relationship adds tremendous value by making the lives of our clients and their families better!
