Doing Business in Singapore

Market Overview
The Singapore economy expanded by 2.0% in 2015 and real GDP is forecasted to grow between 1.0% and 3.0% in 2016. Foreign investments, combined with investments through government-linked corporations, underpin Singapore's open, heavily trade-dependent economy.  U.S. exports to Singapore totaled $28.7 billion in 2015, down 5.2% and U.S. imports from Singapore rose 10.8% to $18.2 billion. China was Singapore’s top source of imports, followed by the United States, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Germany, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. 
 
In 2016, the U.S. and Singapore commemorated 50 years of formal bilateral relations.  Trade between the U.S. and Singapore has continued to expand, thanks to one of the most successful FTAs on record, reaching $47 billion in 2015. Singapore was the United States’ 13th largest export market and 17thlargest trading partner in 2015.  It is a U.S. partner in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, with 10 other Asia-Pacific countries. The TPP agreement –concluded in October 2015 and signed in February 2016 – will significantly liberalize trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific and advance U.S. economic interests in some of the fastest growing economies in the world.
 
Singapore has been ranked #1 in the world for ease of doing business since 2003 by the World Bank. Five reasons U.S. companies should consider exporting to Singapore are:
 Major distribution and logistics hub and gateway to the ASEAN region
 Lack of corruption
 Favorable tax codes
 Strong intellectual property protection
 English speaking population
Return to top
Market Challenges
Singapore is generally a free port as more than 99% of all imports enter Singapore duty-free. For social and/or environmental reasons, it levies high excise taxes on distilled spirits and wine, tobacco products, motor vehicles, and gasoline. Competing with global suppliers remains a key challenge for American companies. With the ongoing restructuring of Singapore’s economy, U.S. companies doing business in the country can expect increased operating costs and a continued tightening labor market.  
U.S. companies also face technical import barriers for beef, pork and poultry products, and restrictions on satellite dishes and foreign newspapers. Service barriers include pay television, licensing of online news websites, legal services, banking and healthcare industries. Details on the barriers can be found in the USTR 2016 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers available online at  https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2016-NTE-Report-FINAL.pdf
The next 50 years will present new challenges to Singapore in the form of a maturing economy, growing influence of social media and increasing competition from other trade agreements and ASEAN partners.

Market Opportunities
U.S. exporters will find a promising market for the following industry sectors in Singapore: aircraft and parts, medical devices, environmental control equipment, computer hardware, software & peripherals, telecommunication equipment, laboratory and scientific equipment, oil & gas, semiconductors, industrial automation and education.
 
The following are major infrastructure projects, significant government procurements and business opportunities in Singapore:
$500 million second Liquid National Gas (LNG) terminal is being planned;
$150 million Very Large Floating Structure (VLFS) tender is postponed to the second half of 2016 due to the downturn in the oil and gas sector;
$580 million blueprint to grow the clean energy industry in Singapore;
Construction of a new 300-bed hospital for infectious disease slated for completion by 2018 and a new $135 million National Heart Center Building by 2020;
Construction of up to 25 public nursing homes by 2020, and four public acute medical care hospitals and up to 12 polyclinics by 2030;
Private medical groups will spend more than $406 million to build, expand and upgrade their healthcare facilities. Renovations at the Raffles Hospital are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2017
Construction of Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 4 and Terminal 5;
$2.6 billion Phase 3 and 4 port expansion at Pasir Panjang Terminal;
The national water agency, the Public Utilities Board (PUB), has been expanding the water infrastructure over the years and is still forging ahead with further developments. Areas of particular interest include filtering and purifying machinery and apparatus, technologies involving wastewater recycling and treatment, and desalination technologies;
$2.0 billion of Singapore Government ICT tenders in the Financial Year 2016 (April 2016-March 2017).
Return to top
Market Entry Strategy
Many U.S. exporters successfully use agents or distributors to serve the Singapore and other Southeast Asia markets while over 3,700 U.S. firms have set up operations in the country. Singapore firms are aggressive when it comes to representing new products and usually respond enthusiastically to new opportunities.  
Price, quality and service are the three main factors for Singapore buyers.  U.S. exporters should be aware that competition is strong and buyers expect good after-sales service.  Selling techniques vary according to the industry and product and are comparable to the techniques used in most other sophisticated markets.  It is also important for U.S. firms to visit their representatives and maintain close contact with them.

      What our clients are saying:    













There are very few organizations that truly understand what it means to put the client's interests first. American Business is one of them. Our clients expect extraordinary results, and so do we. American Business delivers.

I have worked with American Business for over three years. Life insurance is an important part of our holistic approach with our clients. Their independence and attention to detail and service which is important for us sets them apart. They also stress education and spend the time to educate our advisors. We trust their approach and philosophy. 



- Albert J. Zdenek, Jr. CPA/PFS,  TRAUST SOLLUS® WEALTH MANAGEMENT, President & CEO 















I have worked closely with the team of professionals from American Business for over 30 years. We started our relationship when I was in residency at Columbia and ever since they have helped me with my family insurance protection, college planning, and estate planning. Throughout the years American Business has also assisted with my Mom’s estate and insurance planning. There are many firms that represent offering continuity of assistance to physicians throughout the stages of their career; American Business is the only one I am aware of that actually has and continues to deliver on this important promise. Having the endorsement of the AMAIA is very important to physicians like me, because it gives us the opportunity to take advantage of exclusive discounted insurance products from trustworthy and experienced professionals. I strongly recommend that any physician in private practice, group practice, academia, or even retirement set up a meeting with American Business. My family and I are grateful for their expert advice and solid guidance.

Ø USING AN AGENT OR DISTRIBUTOR
Many U.S. exporters successfully use agents or distributors to serve the Singapore and other Southeast Asia markets while over 3,700 U.S. firms have set up operations in the country. Singapore firms are aggressive when it comes to representing new products and usually respond enthusiastically to new opportunities.  
 
Price, quality and service are the three main factors for Singapore buyers.  U.S. exporters should be aware that competition is strong and buyers expect good after-sales service.  Selling techniques vary according to the industry and product and are comparable to the techniques used in most other sophisticated markets.  It is also important for U.S. firms to visit their representatives and maintain close contact with them.
A list of services offered by CS Singapore can be obtained from our website at www.export.gov/singapore.

Ø ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE
American firms wishing to establish a presence in Singapore have several straightforward options to do so.  They can establish a Representative Office (RO), register as a Branch of the parent, or incorporate as a Singapore company.  General information on establishing an office can be found at http://www.enterpriseone.gov.sg/en/Business%20Stages/Start.aspx. 
If an American company wishes to carry on operations in Singapore, it should register a branch office or incorporate a local company with the Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) – http://www.acra.gov.sg. ACRA publishes an excellent guide that takes the first time registrant through the process of establishing a branch office or incorporating in Singapore.
Representative Office
Setting up a Representative Office in Singapore can be a good way for American firms to explore business opportunities in Singapore or the region.  ROs in banking and insurance need to register with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and meet the guidelines or requirements lay out by the MAS.  ROs in all other industries need to register with International Enterprise (IE) Singapore.
ROs can only carry out market research, conduct feasibility studies or work as a liaison on behalf of the parent company. RO may not conduct business directly or on behalf of the parent company. ROs cannot ship, transship or store goods in Singapore.  American firms can either work through an agent or distributor to do so or establish their own commercial presence.
Branch Office
For Branch Offices, the Companies Act requires a foreign company to appoint two local agents in Singapore to act on behalf of the company.  The agents must be ordinarily resident in Singapore i.e. a Singaporean Citizen, a Singapore Permanent Resident, or a person who has been issued an EntrePass/Approval-In-Principle letter/Dependent Pass.
Establishing a Singapore Business
American firms can also register a sole-proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership or incorporate a company in Singapore.  For a sole proprietorship the process takes about one day, while more complex business entities can take up to six weeks and require lawyers and accountants to assist with incorporation documents. A point to bear in mind is that registration/incorporation of a company does not automatically mean that expatriate staff can be assigned to Singapore. Foreign staff must obtain employment passes from the Singapore Ministry of Manpower, although this is generally quite routine.
Additional Information:

Ø FRANCHISING
Singapore is home to a wide variety of franchise concepts with more than 500 concepts and over 30,000 franchisees operating in the country.  Foreign franchises are well received and the United States is by far the largest supplier of foreign franchises in the country.  There are American franchises in practically every industry.  McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Wing Zone, Krispy Kreme, Subway, Starbucks, Ben and Jerry’s, Gymboree, New Horizons, Mister Minit, Avis, Toys R Us, On-line Trading Academy, Comfort Keepers, Contours Express, and many others have operations in Singapore.
 
Singaporeans continue to seek out new franchise concepts to introduce into the country. The success of selling a franchise in Singapore is based on a number of factors including brand name, up-front costs and royalties, the concept’s uniqueness and the flexibility of the franchise agreement.  U.S. franchisors should note that real estate in Singapore is prohibitively expensive and getting a good location is a challenge, especially for those in the retail and F&B business.
With its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure, Singapore serves as the regional showcase and distribution center for U.S. franchisors wishing to enter the markets of Asia.  There have been instances where visitors from the region saw a franchise concept in Singapore and were interested in bringing it back to their own countries. In 2015, Singapore attracted over 15 million visitors from around the world. The country’s multi-ethnic society also makes it an ideal location for foreign franchisors to test their concepts and use the reaction to gauge the acceptance of their franchise in Asia. There are also opportunities for U.S. franchisors to work with Singapore companies to access markets in nearby countries. Singapore investors may buy franchise licenses for additional markets in the Southeast Asian region and not for Singapore alone.

Ø DIRECT MARKETING
The direct marketing industry in Singapore began in the early 1990s and now includes direct mail, telemarketing, television sales, mail order, call centers, fulfillment and e-commerce firms. The Direct Marketing Association of Singapore represents both users and service providers. The direct marketing industry is well supported by service companies including: Singapore Post, Singapore Telecom Call Center, Teledirect, TNT International Mail, Ogilvy One and MMS Consultancy, among many others. The Singapore government also actively supports the industry by assisting companies (through financial incentives) in using direct marketing for their trading activities through its Direct Marketing Program.
 
The Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS), a self-regulatory body, was established in 1976.  It provides a forum for all direct-selling companies in Singapore to discuss problems of common concern and to codify a high standard of business practices throughout the industry. The DSAS has adopted a Code of Conduct by which member-companies in the Association must abide by in every aspect of business. Through the Code of Conduct, DSAS aims to further inculcate the spirit and practice of ethical direct-selling within its member-companies, setting examples for others to follow.

Ø JOINT VENTURES / LICENSING
Foreign investors are not required to enter into joint ventures or cede management control to local interests.  In Singapore, local and foreign investors are subject to the same basic laws. Apart from regulatory requirements in some sectors, the government screens investment proposals only to determine eligibility for various incentive regimes. Singapore places no restrictions on reinvestment or repatriation of earnings or capital.
Licensing is also a viable alternative in Singapore. With one of the strongest IPR protection schemes in Asia, a well-developed legal framework and an advanced manufacturing base, Singapore is an attractive location for American licensors.
Return to Top
Ø SELLING TO THE GOVERNMENT
Singapore is a signatory to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement.  The U.S.-Singapore FTA provides increased access for U.S. firms to Singapore’s central government procurement.  U.S. firms generally find Singapore to be a receptive, open and lucrative market.  The Singaporean government procurement system is considered by many American firms to be fair and transparent.  However, some U.S. and local firms have expressed concerns that government-owned and government-linked companies (GLCs) may receive preferential treatment in the government procurement process.  Singapore denies that it gives any preferences to GLCs or that GLCs give preferences to other GLCs.  Procurement recommendations are made at the technical level and then forwarded to management for concurrence. Bidders should work closely with the project manager to determine the relative importance of decision criteria such as technical capability and price. Bidders must meet the specifications set out in the tender. Post mortem hearings or meetings for losing bidders are not required or common. Government procurement regulations are contained in Instruction Manual 3, available from the Ministry of Finance.  The Singapore Government also advertises its tenders on its website at www.gebiz.gov.sg. 
Return to Top
Ø DISTRIBUTION AND SALES CHANNELS
Singapore's distribution and sales channels are simple, direct and open to the participation of foreign firms established in Singapore. Because of Singapore’s role as a regional hub, most local distributors will also have knowledge of regional distribution rules and regulations. Most consumer goods are imported by stocking distributors who resell to retailers.  Some goods are imported directly for sale in the importer's own retail outlets.
Return to Top
Ø SELLING FACTORS / TECHNIQUES
Price, quality and service are the main selling factors in Singapore.  Prospective exporters to Singapore should be aware that competition is strong and that buyers expect good after-sales service.  Selling techniques vary according to the industry or the product involved, but they are comparable to the techniques used in any other sophisticated market.
Return to Top
Ø ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
Singapore is one of the first countries in the world to enact a law that addresses issues that arise in the context of electronic contracts and digital signatures.  The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) (Cap 88) was enacted to provide a legal foundation for electronic signatures, and to give predictability and certainty to contracts formed electronically.  The Singapore ETA follows closely the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Commerce, which sets the framework for electronic laws in many countries.  The full text of the ETA can be found at the Singapore Statutes Online website:
http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;query=DocId%3A294c715e-89c8-48c4-8e14-58b9ea4f1c29%20Depth%3A0%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0 
Return to Top
Ø TRADE PROMOTION AND ADVERTISING
There are many specialized trade magazines in Singapore and scores of trade fairs that can be used to promote U.S. goods and services.  The major English-language daily newspapers are the Straits Times and the Business Times.  They are available at http://www.straitstimes.com and http://www.businesstimes.com.sg. The major Chinese daily is Lianhe Zaobao (http://www.zaobao.com). Leads for local advertising and promotional service agencies can be found at http://www.yellowpages.com.sg.   Major trade fair organizers include Singapore Exhibition Services (http://www.sesallworld.com/), Reed Exhibition Services (http://www.reedexpo.com.sg/), Experia Events (http://www.experiaevents.com) and Koelnmesse (http://www.koelnmesse.com.sg).
 
Return to Top
Ø PRICING
Pricing is very competitive.  Major department stores and retail chains offer fixed-price merchandise, while the smaller shops expect buyers to bargain.  Hard bargaining is common in the commercial and industrial sectors as well, where buyers usually want a discount and vendors inflate their initial offers accordingly.  Credit terms of 30-60-90 days are common.  Buyers will often retain 10% of the sales price for major electronic equipment purchases until the vendor has installed the machine and it is performing according to specifications.
Typical Product Pricing Structures: Depending on the type of product, importer mark-ups range from 20-40%, while retail mark-ups are often more than 100%.  Industrial goods are brought in by stocking distributors, who add on at least 20% before sale to end-users, or by agents whose commissions generally run about 7-10%.  These mark-ups are approximate, and will vary widely, depending on the product and the contractual relationship in question.
Return to Top
Ø SALES SERVICE/CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Good sales and customer support are vital in Singapore.  The market is so price competitive that client-focused sales support or customer service can make a big difference.  Singapore distributors respond well to training on new products, and if properly supported by the U.S. manufacturer will do a good job cultivating old customers and developing new ones.
Return to Top
Ø Principle Business Associations
The Singapore Business Federation (SBF, http://www.sbf.org.sg) is the apex business chamber that champions the interests of the Singapore business community in trade, investment and industrial relations. It represents 21,500 companies, as well as key local and foreign business chambers, that contribute significantly to the Singapore economy.
Its formation was to foster a more comprehensive organization and representation of the business community’s interests in Singapore and abroad. 
 
As the apex business chamber, SBF presents a strong collective voice that:
Represents the business Acts as the bridge between the business community and government in Singapore to create and enhance a conducive business environment
Represents the business community in bilateral, regional and multilateral fora for the purpose of promoting trade expansion and business networking in Singapore and abroad
Helps companies build competitiveness and resilience through capacity building initiatives and services
As Business Voice & Value Creator, SBF is committed to advocating key issues that impact the Singapore business community, helping enterprises develop capabilities and venture overseas.
American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore
The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore (AmCham, http://www.amcham.org.sg) is the leading international business association in Singapore, with over 5,000 members representing more than 750 companies.  American companies’ direct investment in Singapore exceeds an estimated US$180 billion.  Its mission is to promote the interests of AmCham members in Singapore and the region by providing insights, advocacy and connections through its programing and publications.  AmCham represents its members at the highest levels of government in Singapore and Washington, and advocates on policy issues concerning them.

Ø DUE DILIGENCE
Entities wanting to carry out business in Singapore must register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).  CS Singapore offers the International Company Profile (http://www.export.gov/singapore/servicesforu.s.companies/internationalcompanyprofile/index.asp) service to American firms wishing to check the bona fides of existing or potential partners.

"Why Business Owners Should Never Pay Bills On Time" 

In the New York Times Best Seller, “Profits Aren’t Everything, They’re The Only Thing,” American Management Services founder, George Cloutier, made the bold statement “Never pay your bills on time!” This is why. 

 

 







“Prior to American Management coming to help my company, I was experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety.
I really feel like i got my life back and can't thank American Management enoughfor all the help they have provided me over the last several months."
