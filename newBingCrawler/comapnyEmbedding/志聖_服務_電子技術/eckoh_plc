About Eckoh
Eckoh is a leader in secure payment technology, specialising in assisting organisations that take payments securely when the payment card is not present, for example over the phone, web or mobile. Each year we process over £800 million in card payments for clients in accordance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). As a PCI DSS Level One Compliant Service Provider, more organisations every year trust Eckoh to protect their contact centre and customers from payment card fraud and breaches.
In addition to our payments products we have a portfolio of customer service solutions that target organisations with contact centres. These services enable organisations to manage their customer communications more efficiently and securely. Our multi-channel products give customers the ability to make enquiries, get information or make transactions over the phone, web or mobile without needing to interact with a contact centre agent or advisor. This significantly reduces operational costs, streamlines contact centre processes and reduces inbound call queues.  






Our Strategy
The main new strategy for this year is our establishment and acceleration of growth in the largest payments market in the world, the US. We believe that the opportunity for deploying our payment products has strengthened further as a result of recent adverse publicity in the market relating to data breaches. This has now fuelled a re-evaluation of card and data security processes that has coincided with us establishing a market presence, which leads us to believe that significant sales growth can be delivered over time. 


 
Our near term growth strategy has evolved:

Establish and expand our US footprint to capitalise on secure payment opportunities
Leverage channel partners in both UK and US markets
Maximise international opportunity for the combined Eckoh and Veritape product line
Bring the new payment product OneProx to market
Continue to invest in R&D to underpin next generation product development and maintain market leading position
Continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities
 





ECKOH PLCMEETINGS 


Eckoh plc regularly holds meetings with its major institutional investors where general presentations are given covering the interim and preliminary results. All Directors have access to the Company's nominated advisers who give feedback from shareholders and receive copies of broker update documents.
In addition to regular financial reporting, significant matters relating to the trading or development of the business are disseminated to the market by way of Stock Exchange announcements. Eckoh plc is listed on the Alternative Investment Market ("AIM") under the ticker symbol "ECK". Eckoh is not listed on any other exchange or trading platforms. The RNS announcements released by the Company to the Stock Exchange are provided.
Eckoh is subject to the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. As an AIM listed company Eckoh is not required to comply with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012, however the Board of Eckoh is committed to the principles of good corporate governance and follows, so far as is practicable and appropriate in view of the Enlarged Group's size, stage of development and the nature of the Company the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and complies with the provisions of the QCA Guidelines. 






WARNING!BOILER ROOM SCAM 


The Directors are aware that some Shareholders have been contacted by so called "brokers" from overseas, usually from the USA, offering very high prices for their shares in the Company. These offers are a form of Boiler Room scams as discussed in the release Boiler Room Scams from the Financial Services Authority (FSA).
We would advise Shareholders not to engage in discussions with these "brokers" and to report any such activity to the FSA by completing the online form available on the FSA website.

Eckoh PLC

Issue of Equity & PDMR Share Dealings

RNS Number : 8725L Eckoh PLC 24 July 2017  

                                                                                                                        
Eckoh plc
("Eckoh" or the "Company")
 
PDMR Share Dealings 
 
Eckoh announces that it has issued 250,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the "New Shares") following an exercise of share options by Ed Johnson; Chief Operating Officer and a PDMR of the Company. The options being exercised were granted under the 2012 Eckoh plc Long Term Incentive Plan ("the plan") and the number of New Shares that ultimately vested was subject to the satisfaction of share price targets which were comfortably exceeded well ahead of the earliest date of exercise, being 1 January 2016. Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the New Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM, with dealings expected to commence on 4 August 2017 ("Admission"). 
 
Following Admission, the Company will have a total of 251,533,520 Ordinary Shares in issue each carrying one voting right. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Shareholders may use this figure of 251,533,520 Ordinary Shares as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
 
Subsequent to their issue, Eckoh was notified by Ed Johnson that the New Shares were sold on 21 July 2017 at a price of 46.5p per share (the "Sale"). As a result of the Sale, Ed Johnson is not holding any ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.

Eckoh Plc

Update: Product and geographic expansion underway


                            Eckoh continues to report strong revenue and profit growth. Expansion into the US is on track, with contracts already won by the direct sales team and Eckoh’s reselling partner reporting a strong sales pipeline. Successful development of Eckoh’s OneProx solution could expand its available market from phone-based to e-commerce and point-of-sale applications. While the valuation looks full, successful execution of the growth strategy could drive upgrades and share price upside from this point.

          Consumers are becoming more self-sufficient. Subsequently, Customer Services departments are introducing more ways for their customers to self-help when making orders and purchases. These include automated call options (using menus); voice recognition systems; email responses; and web forms for feedback and/or complaints. Agents are now being viewed as trusted advisers and are increasingly being contacted for complex enquiries. Combining all these elements to create a seamless, multi-channel customer experience is the challenge businesses are now facing. Eckoh provides a full range of customer self service solutions that can help achieve this objective. Contact us to find out more: www.eckoh.com

Eckoh plc
("Eckoh" or the "Company")
 
Acquisition of Product Support Solutions, Inc ("PSS") to
Accelerate US Growth and Support International Expansion
 
Eckoh (AIM: ECK), the global provider of secure payment products and customer contact solutions, is pleased to announce the acquisition of PSS, a US-based company specialising in the management of contact centre and customer experience technology, for a total consideration of $7.6m (approximately £5.0m) (the "Acquisition"). After accounting for $2.0m (approximately £1.3m) of cash in PSS, the net consideration comprises $5.6m (approximately £3.7m). 
 
With PSS's business based in the US, UK, and Australia, the acquisition will support Eckoh's continued expansion in the US where PSS has a significant presence, and further scale Eckoh's business in the UK as well as other potential international marketplaces, notably Australia. It will also bring additional products and services which can be cross-sold into the enlarged customer base.
 
The cash consideration of $5.6m (approximately £3.7m) has been funded by a new £5.0m banking facility with the remaining balance of the new facility being used to repay the balance of an existing debt facility. The remaining $2.0m (approximately £1.3m) consideration is payable in 2,967,084 new Eckoh ordinary shares of 0.25p each ("Ordinary Shares") at a price of 43.18 pence per share (the "Total Consideration Shares"), being the average share price for the 20 dealing days preceding completion of the transaction. 1,442,925 of the Total Consideration Shares (the "Initial Consideration Shares") have been issued and allotted pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition with the balance, namely 1,524,159 Ordinary Shares, being issued and admitted to trading on AIM on the first anniversary of the Acquisition, subject to adjustment to satisfy any future claims which may arise under the warranties contained within the sale and purchase agreement. The Total Consideration Shares will be subject to a lock-up arrangement of two years following completion of the Acquisition and a further 6 month orderly market arrangement.
 
Through its global alliances with Genesys, Aspect, Avaya, Microsoft, Nuance and other major contact centre technology providers, PSS assists clients in improving the efficiency of their contact centres and the quality of their customer interactions through the various services and solutions it provides. Its large client base encompasses multiple industry sectors and includes well-known brands such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Vodafone, Bank of America and Telstra. Many of PSS's clients require third party support for their legacy systems, with PSS seeking to assist them through the life cycle of their requirements, from transitioning existing architecture through to innovation, design and deployment of new solutions to solve complex issues. 
 
For the year ended 31 December 2014, PSS generated unaudited revenues of $17.4m (approximately £11.3m) and a profit before tax of $1.2m (approximately £0.8m). Included within PSS' revenue is approximately $4.0m (approximately £2.6m) that would be classified as agency fees pursuant to Eckoh's accounting policies and would have been recognised as approximately $0.2m (approximately £130,000) within Eckoh's accounts. Profit would not be affected by this reclassification. As at 31 December 2014, unaudited net assets of PSS were $1.2m (approximately £0.8m). The transaction is expected to be immediately earnings enhancing.
 
Strategic rationale:
 
The acquisition of PSS is in line with Eckoh's strategy to become a dominant provider of secure payments products and customer contact solutions for contact centres, primarily in the US and UK markets, through organic growth, partnership and acquisition.  
 
Key strategic benefits of the acquisition include:
·      Further building Eckoh's scale: PSS has a 12 year history of providing contact centre solutions to a worldwide client base with a highly skilled workforce of 76 people based in the US, UK and Australia.  PSS will expand Eckoh's total client and partner base considerably, increasing its market presence and share in these markets.
 
·      Cross-selling Eckoh product offerings into the enlarged customer base: With an enhanced product portfolio, the Directors believe that there is a considerable opportunity to cross-sell Eckoh products into the PSS customer base, many of which need to transition from their legacy systems to more effective, progressive solutions. This is expected to enable Eckoh to increase PSS's service offering and, as a result, revenue per employee.
 
·      Extending Eckoh's service and product proposition: PSS has a proven product portfolio ranging from supporting client's legacy systems, designing and supporting IVR systems, through to innovative desktop solutions for contact centre agents. Eckoh's strategy has been to provide a range of technology solutions that facilitate much of the consumers' engagement and journey, using their channel of choice, from initial contact through to their interaction with a contact centre agent (if this is required). PSS's product set and partnerships will enable Eckoh to begin to extend the reach of its solutions to the desktop of the agent and to the actual infrastructure that underpins it. This will serve to increase client value and assist with retention. 
 
·      Leveraging PSS's trusted adviser status: PSS delivers a high quality, differentiated service, which underpins strong recurring revenues and client retention rates of 99%. The Directors believe that this is an ideal sales platform from which to introduce Eckoh's secure payments proposition. 
 
·      Enhancing growth prospects in the US: PSS has a team of skilled, experienced employees across two offices in the US, including 10 sales and marketing staff. With PSS's excellent local reputation and blue chip customer base, PSS will support Eckoh's continued expansion in the US, strengthening its direct selling capabilities. In addition, PSS's senior management team will remain with the business to help drive Eckoh's growth ambitions in the US.
 
·      Supporting premised-based deployments in the US: The secure payment contracts that have been won thus far in the US and the sales opportunities in the pipeline have a far higher proportion of deployments on the client's premises than is the case in the UK market. These installations will need to be supported in a timely and cost effective manner. With a base of support staff and skilled field engineers based in 20 US States and already servicing customers across the whole of the US, PSS gives Eckoh an immediate infrastructure to facilitate support and grow this part of the market.  
 
·      Strengthening the opportunity for additional international expansion: Eckoh has continued to make good progress with its direct international sales over the last year and PSS's international presence will complement Eckoh's current reach. In particular, with PSS already having an established presence in Australia via its contract with Telstra, Australia's largest telecommunications and media company, this provides a significant opportunity to enter the Australian secure payment market from which other markets in the region could also be exploited.
 
 
Additional details:
 
Following the issue of the Initial Consideration Shares, the Company will have a total of 224,788,848 Ordinary Shares in issue, each carrying one voting right. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in Treasury. This figure of 224,788,848 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
 
Application has been made for the Initial Consideration Shares, which will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing ordinary shares, to be admitted to trading on AIM which is expected to occur on or about 23 November 2015.


 
Nik Philpot, Chief Executive Officer of Eckoh, commented:
"PSS is a unique business with a highly experienced workforce and quality service offering, making it a trusted partner to a number of large enterprises in the US, UK and Australia. 
 
"This acquisition not only significantly expands our presence in the US market, a key part of our growth strategy, but it also strengthens our scale and product proposition, with excellent cross-selling opportunities across the enlarged customer base. It therefore represents exciting progress in our aim to become a dominant and best in class provider for contact centre and payment protection solutions.
 
"We look forward to welcoming the PSS team to Eckoh and remain very excited about the future growth prospects for the Group in the US, UK and now the Australian markets."

About Eckoh plc
 
Eckoh is a global provider of secure payment products and customer contact solutions, working with organisations in over 10 countries.
 
Our range of secure payment products removes customer card data from contact centres and IT environments. They are designed to help merchants reduce the risk of fraud and become compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Eckoh's CallGuard product can be deployed on the customer's site or hosted in the Cloud. It allows contact centres to take card payments from customers without their agents seeing, hearing or accessing card data in any way. We have been a PCI DSS Level One accredited Service Provider since 2010 and we currently process over $1 billion in card payments annually.
 
Eckoh's customer service solutions enable payments, transactions and enquiries to be processed without the caller needing to talk to a contact centre agent. This significantly reduces our clients' costs, whilst freeing up their agents to deal with more complex enquiries. These solutions are delivered over the phone, web and mobile devices. Eckoh is the largest provider of such hosted services in the UK.
