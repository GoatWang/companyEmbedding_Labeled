CCID Consulting Company Limited Key Developments

CCID Consulting Company Limited Provides Consolidated Earnings Guidance for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 25 17
CCID Consulting Company Limited provided consolidated earnings guidance for the six months ended June 30, 2017. For the six months, the company the profit after tax is expected to increase by approximately 72% as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The expected increase is mainly attributable to: Firstly, the Group proceeded with the transformation of single planning to campaign organization, investment attraction, application and registration, and custodianship for its market consultancy services on the basis of ensuring the business of its management and strategy consultancy services remain basically stable. By amassing the cluster effect of industrial development, the Group launched the service model of `CCID Accelerator'. Through establishing the investment and financing information database and the repository of listed companies, the Group continued to explore new businesses. Meanwhile, the Group pushed ahead with the extension from planning to investments, constructions, and operations for its information businesses; Secondly, the Group focused on expediting the transformation and upgrade of its business models with respect to industry-park collaboration, corporate strategies, investments and financing, information applications, etc., as well as constantly driving the improvement in its competitive strengths, and thus the turnover increased by approximately 15% as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Finally, the Group's costs and expenses increased by approximately 7% as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, which appears to be in a healthy trajectory as compared to the increase in the Group's turnover. The increase in costs attributable to the business operations was the major contributor to the changes. The Group continued to enhance its internal control and management to control the growth in costs and expenses within a reasonable range, and thus the increase rate of costs and expenses was far lower than the growth rate of turnover.
