Franchise or Trademark License Agreements
If your SME is interested in:
marketing a product or service and the brand (trademark) of that product is owned by others, or
entering or expanding the existing market for your product or service for which your SME owns the rights conferred by a trademark,

you may consider a trademark license agreement or a franchise agreement.
The principle function of a trademark or service mark is to distinguish the goods and services of one enterprise from that of another, thereby often identifying the source and making an implied reference to quality and reputation. This function is to some extent prejudiced if the trademark owner licenses another enterprise to use the trademark through a trademark license agreement. Therefore, the trademark owner is well advised, and often by law or contract required, to maintain a close connection with the licensee to ensure that the quality standards are maintained so that the consumer is not deceived.
Through a franchise agreement the owner of certain technical or other expertise who has usually gained a reputation in connection with the use of a trade or service mark (the franchiser) may team up with another enterprise (franchisee) who will bring in expertise of his own or financial resources to provide goods or services directly to the consumer. The franchiser will ensure, through the supply of technical and management skills, that the franchisee maintains the quality and other standards in relation to the use of the trade or service mark which often require certain standardized features like, for example, a uniform trade dress.
Copyright License Agreements
If your SME is interested in:
manufacturing, distributing or marketing the results of the literary and artistic efforts of creators, or
entering a market or expanding or extending your existing market for the literary and artistic efforts of your enterprise

you may consider a copyright license agreement. Many owners find it difficult to manage their rights on their own and they have formed collective management organizations that represent them and manage their rights for them. If you are interested in acquiring these rights you may have to address yourself to the appropriate collective management organization that will be authorized to license the various rights of their members.

What is a Franchise






   













WHAT IS A FRANCHISE?
Franchising is simply a method for expanding a business and distributing goods and services through a licensing relationship.  In franchising, franchisors (a person or company that grants the license to a third party for the conducting of a business under their marks) not only specify the products and services that will be offered by the franchisees (a person or company who is granted the license to do business under the trademark and trade name by the franchisor), but also provide them with an operating system, brand and support.  A brief separate glossary of franchising terms is available on IFA’s website at http://www.franchise.org/what-are-common-franchise-terms
Business Format Franchising
There are two different types of franchising relationships. Business Format Franchising is the type most identifiable to the average person.  In a business format franchise relationship the franchisor provides to the franchisee not just its trade name, products and services, but an entire system for operating the business.  The franchisee generally receives site selection and development support, operating manuals, training, brand standards, quality control, a marketing strategy and business advisory support from the franchisor.  More than 120 diverse industries use franchising as their route to market including:
Automotive
Business Services
Commercial and Residential Services
Education
Lodging
Personal Services
Quick Service Restaurants (fast food)
Real Estate
Retail Food
Retail Products and Services
Senior Care and Medical Services
Table/Full Service Restaurants
Traditional or Product Distribution 
While less identified with franchising, traditional or product distribution franchising is actually larger in total sales than business format franchising.  In a traditional franchise, the focus is not on the system of doing business, but mainly on the products manufactured or supplied by the franchisor to the franchisee.  In most, but not in all situations, the manufactured products generally need pre- and post-sale service as found in the automobile industry. Examples of traditional or product distribution franchising can be found in the bottling, gasoline, automotive and other manufacturers.
Franchising is About Relationships
Many people, when they think of franchising, focus first on the law.  While the law is certainly important, it is not the central thing to understand about franchising.  At its core, franchising is about the franchisor’s brand value, how the franchisor supports its franchisees, how the franchisee meets its obligations to deliver the products and services to the system’s brand standards and most importantly – franchising is about the relationship that the franchisor has with its franchisees.  In a 2014 survey by Franchise Business Review on franchisees’ relationship with their franchisors it was determined:
 
90 percent enjoy operating their business,
88 percent of franchisees enjoy being part of their organization,
85 percent feel positive about their affiliation with their franchisor,
83 percent respect their franchisor,
80 percent feel their franchisor operates with a high level of honesty,
78 percent would recommend their franchise brand to others, and
73 percent would “Do it all over again” if they had the option.
 
Franchising is About Brands
A franchisor’s brand is its most valuable asset and consumers decide which business to shop at and how often to frequent that business based on what they know, or think they know, about the brand.  To a certain extent consumers really don’t care who owns the business so long as their brand expectations are met. If you become a franchisee, you will certainly be developing a relationship with your customers to maintain their loyalty, and most certainly customers will choose to purchase from you because of the quality of your services and the personal relationship you establish with them.  But first and foremost, they have trust in the brand to meet their expectations, and the franchisor and the other franchisees in the system rely upon you to meet those expectations. 
Franchising is About Systems and Support
Great franchisors provide systems, tools and support so that their franchisees have the ability to live up to the system’s brand standards and ensure customer satisfaction.  And, franchisors and all of the other franchisees expect that you will independently manage the day-to-day operation of your businesses so that you will enhance the reputation of the company in your market area.
When selecting a franchise system to invest in, you want to evaluate the types of support you will be provided and how well the franchisor is managing the evolution of the products and services so that it keeps up with changing consumer expectations.  Some of the more common services that franchisors provide to franchisees include:
            A recognized brand name,
            Site selection and site development assistance,
            Training for you and your management team,
            Research and development of new products and services,
            Headquarters and field support,
            Initial and continuing marketing and advertising.
You want to select a franchisor that routinely and effectively enforces system standards.  This is important to you as enforcement of brand standards by the franchisor is meant to protect franchisees from the possible bad acts of other franchisees that share the brand with them.  Since customers see franchise systems as a branded chain of operations, great products and services delivered by one franchisee benefits the entire system. The opposite is also true.
Franchising is also a Contractual Relationship
While from the public’s vantage point, franchises look like any other chain of branded businesses, they are very different.  In a franchise system, the owner of the brand does not manage and operate the locations that serve consumers their products and services on a day-to-day basis.  Serving the consumer is the role and responsibility of the franchisee.
Franchising is a contractual relationship between a licensor (franchisor) and a licensee (franchisee) that allows the business owner to use the licensor’s brand and method of doing business to distribute products or services to consumers. While every franchise is a license, not every license is a franchise under the law. Sometimes that can be very confusing.
In the United States, a franchise is a specific type of licensing arrangement defined by the Federal Trade Commission and also by several states.  In the United States a franchise generally exists when:
            The franchisor licenses a franchisee the right to use its trade or service mark;
To identify the franchisee’s business in marketing a product or service using the franchisor’s operating methods;
            The franchisor provides the franchisee with support and exercises certain controls; and,
            The franchisee pays the franchisor a fee.
The definition of a franchise is not uniform in every state.  Some states for example, may also include a marketing plan or community of interest provision in the definition.  The definition of what is a franchise can vary significantly under the laws in some states and it is important that you don’t simply rely on the federal definition of a franchise in understanding any particular state’s requirements.
Put another way, in a franchise a business (the franchisor) licenses its trade name (the brand, such as BrightStar or Sport Clips) and its operating methods (its system of doing business) to a person or group operating within a specific territory or location (the franchisee), which agrees to operate its business according to the terms of a contract (the franchising agreement).  The franchisor provides the franchisee with franchising leadership and support, and exercises some controls to ensure the franchisee’s adherence to brand guidelines.
In exchange, the franchisee usually pays the franchisor a one-time initial fee (the franchise fee) and a continuing fee (known as a royalty) for the use of the franchisor’s trade name and operating methods.  The franchisee is responsible for the day-to-day management of its independently owned business and benefits or risks loss based on his own performance and capabilities.
Investing in a franchise or becoming a franchisor can be a great opportunity.  But before you select any franchise investment and sign any franchise agreement, do your homework, understand what the franchise system is offering and get the support of a qualified franchise lawyer.

Acquisition and Placing
23rd March 2017
Franchise Brands PLC
23 March 2017



THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INCLUDING THE APPENDIX (THE “ANNOUNCEMENT”) AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, JAPAN OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE, NOR IS IT INTENDED THAT IT WILL BE SO APPROVED.
The information contained within this Announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (“MAR”). Upon publication of this Announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.
23 March 2017
Franchise Brands plc
 (“Franchise Brands”, “the Group” or “the Company”)
 Proposed acquisition of Metro Rod Limited (“Metro Rod”), proposed placing by way of an accelerated bookbuild to raise up to £20 million, Notice of General Meeting and restoration of trading on AIM.
Franchise Brands today announces that terms have been conditionally agreed for the proposed acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Metro Rod for a total consideration of £28 million (subject to adjustment based on the financial position of Metro Rod at completion) (“the Acquisition”).
The Company also announces its intention to conduct a placing with certain institutional and other investors and the Directors to raise gross proceeds of up to approximately £20 million at 67 pence per Ordinary Share in order to partially fund the Acquisition (the “Placing”). The Placing is being conducted through an accelerated bookbuilding process (the “Bookbuild”) which will be launched immediately following this Announcement.
Metro Rod is a leading provider of drain clearance and maintenance services, delivered 24/7/365 on a largely reactive basis by 40 regional Franchisees, with geographical coverage across the majority of the UK.  Founded in 1983, the Directors believe Metro Rod has grown to become one of only five companies in the drainage sector operating on a national basis. Metro Rod serves national business customers across multiple sectors including facilities management, retail, water utilities, social housing, hospitality and insurance, as well as local businesses and other customers in the private and public sectors.
The Directors believe the Acquisition represents a transformational step in respect of Franchise Brands’ strategy to pursue the selective acquisition of franchise businesses that could benefit from the Company’s central services, such as marketing, and also the experience of the Board and management team in developing franchise businesses.
Highlights:




●


Metro Rod is a leading provider, profitable and a cash generative business with an experienced management team, a mature and stable franchise network and high customer retention rates.




 



●


The Directors believe the Acquisition will be significantly earnings enhancing for the Group as Metro Rod is being purchased by the Group at a price the Directors consider attractive and the combined businesses’ strong cashflow and balance sheet provide an opportunity to utilise debt to finance the Acquisition.




 



●


The total consideration of £28 million (subject to adjustment based on the financial position of Metro Rod at completion of the Acquisition) for the Acquisition together with estimated costs of approximately £1.8 million and additional working capital will be funded by the issue of the Placing Shares to raise up to approximately £20 million and new bank facilities of up to £17 million.




 



●


The Directors believe that under the guidance of the Board, and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses, the development of Metro Rod may be accelerated through:




   


  o providing additional sales and marketing support to Franchisees in the
 development of Commercial Accounts;




   


  o further developing Key Accounts in sectors where Metro Rod’s penetration could
 be increased on a relative basis;




   


  o the development of the recently launched Metro Plumb business through
 investment in additional sales and marketing; and




   


  o longer term, extending the “Metro” brand into other B2B sectors.








●


The Acquisition represents an opportunity to leverage Franchise Brands’ and Metro Rod’s complementary strengths in the provision of shared services. For example, Franchise Brands has significant expertise in marketing, which the Directors believe will accelerate the development of Metro Rod’s existing business and the newly launched Metro Plumb business. In contrast, Metro Rod has a substantial call centre capability, whereas Franchise Brands currently outsources this function. The Directors believe that combining the finance teams will also provide the potential for an enhanced finance function for the Enlarged Group.



 
 



●


The addition of Metro Rod to the Group will substantially increase the size and scale of the Group’s operations. This will potentially allow certain functions that were previously sub-scale to be optimised and certain outsourced functions to be brought in-house over time.



 
 



●


Metro Rod increased operating profit before exceptional items by approximately 52 per cent. from £2.1 million in the financial year ended 30 April 2014 to £3.2 million in the financial year ended 30 April 2016.




 



●


Metro Rod generates substantially all its income from fees related to system sales, which the Directors believe will improve the Enlarged Group’s overall quality of income and return from growing Franchisee turnover.  It also operates in a defensive sector, partly due to the emergency nature of the demand for its services.








●


The Directors believe that the B2B expertise and operational capabilities within Metro Rod, combined with the scale of the Enlarged Group, will also allow the Board to evaluate an increased range of future potential acquisition opportunities in the B2B, as well as B2C, sectors.




Given the scale of the Acquisition when compared to the existing Group, the transaction is a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules and requires the Company to issue a new admission document and is conditional, inter alia, on the approval by Shareholders of the Resolutions to be proposed at a General Meeting.  Accordingly, the Company has published the admission document (“Admission Document”), including details of the General Meeting and Resolutions, which will be posted to Shareholders today and is available on the Company’s website at www.franchisebrands.co.uk.
The Directors consider the Acquisition to be an excellent opportunity for the Group and in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors recommend unanimously that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting as they and certain other Shareholders have irrevocably undertaken to do so in respect of their beneficial holdings of Ordinary Shares, which represent approximately 70.34 per cent of the Existing Ordinary Shares.
Allenby Capital is acting as nominated adviser and joint broker to the Company and Dowgate Capital is acting as joint broker to the Company in connection with the Acquisition, Placing and Admission.
Restoration of trading on AIM
With the publication of the Admission Document today, trading in the Company’s Ordinary Shares on AIM will be restored at 7.30 a.m. today.
Details of the Placing
In conjunction with the Acquisition, the Company proposes to raise up to approximately £20 million, before expenses, through the issue of the Placing Shares at the Placing Price. The Placing Shares will represent approximately 38.4 per cent. of the Enlarged Share Capital on Admission.
The Placing is being conducted by way of the Bookbuild. The Bookbuild will open with immediate effect and is expected to close no later than 6 p.m. (London time) today. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild and the making of allocations may be accelerated or delayed at the discretion of Allenby Capital and Dowgate Capital (together the “Joint Bookrunners”).  The appendix to this Announcement contains detailed terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) applicable to the Placing and the Bookbuild. The Placing is not underwritten.
By choosing to participate in the Placing and by making an oral and/or written legally binding offer to acquire Placing Shares, investors will be deemed to have read and understood this Announcement (including the appendix) and the Admission Document in its entirety, and to be making such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and to be making the representations, warranties, undertakings and acknowledgements contained in this Announcement (including the appendix).
The Placing is conditional, inter alia, upon the passing of the Resolutions at the General Meeting and Admission.  If the Resolutions are passed and the other conditions set out in the Acquisition Agreement (save for Admission), the Facilities Agreement (save for Admission) and the Placing Agreement (save for payment of the consideration to the Vendor and Admission) are met, it is expected that the Enlarged Share Capital will be admitted to trading on AIM with effect from 8.00 a.m. on 11 April 2017.
The Placing is being made on a non pre-emptive basis as the time delay and costs associated with a pre-emptive offer are considered by the Directors to be excessive for the Company’s requirements.
The Directors intend to subscribe, in aggregate, for 16,671,459 Placing Shares in the Placing at a cost of approximately £11.2 million. This represents approximately 56 per cent. of the gross proceeds to be raised in the Placing and the Directors believe this demonstrates their strong degree of confidence in the Enlarged Group.
The Directors are treated as related parties of the Company under the AIM Rules. The Directors’ participation in the Placing is therefore treated as a related party transaction pursuant to rule 13 of the AIM Rules. Accordingly, the Company’s nominated adviser, Allenby Capital, considers that the terms of the Directors’ participation in the Placing are fair and reasonable insofar as Shareholders are concerned.
Defined terms used in this Announcement shall have the same meaning (unless the context otherwise requires) as ascribed to them in the “Definitions” and “Technical Glossary” section at the bottom of this Announcement.
Stephen Hemsley, Executive Chairman of Franchise Brands plc, commented:
“We are delighted to announce the proposed Acquisition of Metro Rod, which represents a transformational step in respect of implementing the Group’s stated buy and build strategy.
“Metro Rod is a market leading, profitable and cash generative business with an experienced management team, a mature and stable franchise network and high customer retention rates.  We believe that Franchise Brands’ significant marketing and franchise management expertise will accelerate the development of Metro Rod’s existing business and its newly launched Metro Plumb business, enabling the business and management team to thrive as part of Franchise Brands.”

BACKGROUND TO AND RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION
The Board is pleased to inform Shareholders that terms have been agreed for the proposed Acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Metro Rod, a leading provider of drain clearance and maintenance services, which are delivered on a largely reactive basis by regional Franchisees. The total consideration for the Acquisition is £28 million (subject to adjustment based on the financial position of Metro Rod at completion of the Acquisition), which together with estimated costs of approximately £1.8 million, will be satisfied in cash at completion of the Acquisition.
It is proposed that the Consideration, associated costs and additional working capital will be funded by the issue of the Placing Shares to raise up to approximately £20 million and new bank facilities of up to £17 million. Given the scale of the Acquisition when compared to the existing Group, the transaction is a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules and therefore requires the Company to issue a new admission document and obtain Shareholder approval for the Acquisition.
The Group’s strategy, as outlined at the time of its IPO, was to pursue the selective acquisition of franchise businesses that could benefit from the Company’s central services, such as marketing, and also the experience of the Board and management team in developing franchise businesses. The Group completed its first acquisition since the IPO, of Barking Mad, in October 2016. The acquisition of Barking Mad broadened Franchise Brands’ portfolio of B2C service businesses with a market leading brand which the Directors believe has an attractive model for Franchisees, a strong management team and a similar customer base to the Group’s existing brands.
The Directors believe the Acquisition represents a transformational step in respect of implementing the Group’s stated buy and build strategy. In particular, the Directors believe the Acquisition represents an opportunity to enter the B2B franchising market at a size and scale that is attractive strategically and at an acquisition price that the Directors consider is significantly accretive to Shareholders.
Furthermore, the Directors believe the range of potential future acquisition opportunities for the Group is likely to be increased as a result of the Acquisition, as both the B2B and B2C franchise sectors would be within its scope. The Directors also believe the Acquisition is likely to lead to an enhanced range of shared services within the Enlarged Group which have the capability to be leveraged across its range of brands and furthermore, will potentially allow the Enlarged Group to optimise some activities that were previously sub-scale.
Metro Rod is a well established and profitable business with an experienced management team who have continued to grow the business through several changes of ownership. However, the Directors believe that under the guidance of the Board, and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses, the development of Metro Rod may be accelerated.
The Board believes the Acquisition is positive for the Group for the following reasons:




●


Significantly earnings-enhancing: The Directors believe Metro Rod is being purchased by the Group at an attractive price of approximately 8.8 times Operating Profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 April 2016, and that the Acquisition will therefore be significantly earnings enhancing for the Group. Metro Rod also benefits from a strong cashflow, which, when combined with the existing Group’s robust cashflow and strong balance sheet, provides an opportunity to utilise debt to finance the Enlarged Group and further enhance earnings per share.








●


Potential for growth in earnings: The Directors believe Metro Rod’s earnings will grow as a result of the continued development of the core business, development of the recently launched Metro Plumb business and, longer term, the additional extension of the “Metro” brand into other B2B sectors.








●


Defensive sector: Metro Rod’s business model has historically demonstrated resilience through changes in the economic cycle. The Directors believe this is partly due to emergency nature of the demand for its services.








●


Experienced management: Metro Rod has an experienced and long standing management team who have continued to grow the business through several changes of ownership. Under the guidance of the experienced Board, and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses, the Directors believe that this team will thrive.








●


Quality of income: Metro Rod generates substantially all its income from fees related to system sales and does not rely on income from Franchisee recruitment or resales. The Directors believe this will improve the Enlarged Group’s overall quality of income and improve the return to the Enlarged Group from growing Franchisee turnover.








●


Opportunities to leverage shared services: The Directors believe Franchise Brands and Metro Rod have complementary strengths in the provision of shared services. For example, Franchise Brands has significant expertise in marketing, which the Directors believe will accelerate the development of Metro Rod’s existing business and the newly launched Metro Plumb business. In contrast, Metro Rod has a substantial call centre capability, whereas Franchise Brands currently outsources this function. The Directors believe that combining the finance teams will also provide the potential for an enhanced finance function for the Enlarged Group.








●


Benefits of operational scale: The addition of Metro Rod to the Group will substantially increase the size and scale of the Group’s operations. This will potentially allow certain functions that were previously sub-scale to be optimised and certain outsourced functions to be brought in-house over time.








●


Increased range of future potential acquisition opportunities: Metro Rod is predominantly a B2B business whereas the Group’s existing brands are B2C businesses. The Directors believe that the B2B expertise and operational capabilities within Metro Rod, combined with the scale of the Enlarged Group, will also allow the Board to evaluate an increased range of future potential acquisition opportunities in the B2B, as well as B2C, sectors.




INFORMATION ON METRO ROD
History of Metro Rod
Metro Rod was founded in 1983 and has subsequently grown to become, the Directors believe, one of only five companies in its sector operating on a national basis. Since 2001, Metro Rod has been part of a group of companies which in 2011 was renamed the Enserve Group. The Enserve Group is a private group of businesses providing infrastructure support services to the utilities sector. The Enserve Group has been under private equity ownership since 2010, most recently by funds managed or advised by Rubicon Partners LLP and Grovepoint Capital LLP.
Metro Plumb was launched by Metro Rod in February 2016 and provides cold water plumbing services, primarily to Key Account customers. All Metro Rod Franchisees were given the opportunity to purchase Metro Plumb franchises covering their respective territories and 30 of the existing 40 Metro Rod Franchisees have done so. The Directors believe that Metro Plumb represents a natural brand extension of the types of emergency response services Metro Rod is able to provide whilst seeking to leverage its existing infrastructure.
Kemac was established in 1993 and is a company owned operation (and not franchised). It built its reputation on providing services to the water utilities market and more recently, by providing plumbing services. Kemac provides plumbing related services to Thames Water and services to other water companies. Kemac also operates six Metro Plumb territories, predominantly in and near the Greater London area.
The Metro Rod business
Metro Rod is a leading provider of drain clearance and maintenance services delivered on a largely reactive basis. The services are predominantly provided by a total of 40 Franchisees with geographical coverage across the majority of the UK.
Metro Rod serves national business customers across multiple sectors including facilities management, retail, water utilities, social housing, hospitality and insurance, as well as local businesses and other customers in the private and public sectors. Domestic customers form only a small part of Metro Rod’s business.
A focus of Metro Rod is to provide a 24/7/365 emergency response service to customers through its
operating model of Key Accounts and Commercial Accounts. The service is provided by regional Franchisees, who on average have been with Metro Rod for 11 years, with extensive support from a large head office team of approximately 140 people.
The Franchise Network
Metro Rod has a mature and stable franchise network. Since May 2013, it has had between 40 to 43
franchisees. The decrease to 40 Franchisees at present, primarily reflects the consolidation of a number of franchise territories.
The franchise is a management franchise in that the Franchisee manages individuals who provide the service. There are over 300 engineers in the Metro Rod network. On average, Franchisees have eight engineers and operate seven vans. The average length of tenure of a Franchisee is approximately 11 years (the longest tenure is currently 23 years).
Metro Rod typically resells two to three franchises every year when Franchisees retire and/or are replaced and these area sales represent a small additional source of revenue for Metro Rod.
Average gross revenue per Franchisee has grown steadily in recent years to reach nearly £740,000 in the financial year ended 30 April 2016. No reliance is placed on a single Franchisee with the largest accounting for 5 per cent. of total Key Account and Commercial Account revenues.
Since February 2016, Kemac has operated the Metro Plumb franchise territory areas in London, Reading and Guildford on behalf of Metro Rod. Southampton, Bournemouth, Edinburgh and Glasgow are vacant plumbing franchise areas with services currently provided on a sub-contracted basis.
The Franchise Model
The Directors believe that the Metro Rod franchise model, which includes Metro Plumb, is a collaborative and mutually dependent one whereby the Franchisees fulfil work which is mostly procured by the franchisor.
Franchisees are awarded the right to operate the brand in geographically-defined territories on an exclusive basis. Territories are identified by postcodes.
Metro Rod, as the brand owner, licenses the brand and intellectual property to the Franchisee. The franchise agreement provides that each Franchisee pays an initial franchise fee or renewal fee to Metro Rod and an on-going MSF for the use of the brand, the retention of the territory, and the provision of the initial and ongoing services and support.
Metro Rod’s franchise business model involves the provision of a range of central support services to its Franchisees. An important service is business management support, in particular the provision of Key Account sales which account for approximately 60 per cent. of the Franchisee’s revenues.
Each Franchisee enters into a Franchise Agreement which grants them the right to trade under the relevant brand for a five year term. Subject to the Franchisee having substantially observed and performed the terms of the Franchise Agreement (and certain other conditions), the Franchisee is eligible to be awarded a renewal of the agreement for a further five year term. Metro Rod is not obliged to offer more than two renewal franchises. The franchisor can only decline to renew or terminate on grounds set out in the Franchise Agreement which include, amongst other things, non-performance and reputational damage.
Franchisees are responsible for the purchase of their own equipment and the hiring of specialist equipment for more complex work. The standard MSF is 22.5 per cent. of gross revenue minus an allowance for deductible items. The current franchise agreements provide for a marketing contribution of 1 per cent. of gross revenue. However, Metro Rod does not currently collect this from the Franchisees.
Metro Rod’s accounts department are responsible for all invoicing on behalf of Franchisees for Key Accounts and Commercial Accounts. Franchisees are paid for servicing Key Accounts regardless of whether Metro Rod has received payment, and Metro Rod bears the credit risk for these accounts.
Franchisees bear the credit risk for Commercial Accounts and are paid, on average, after 45 days. Payment terms for Key Accounts are typically 60 days, however the Franchisees are paid, on average, after 45 days. This explains the working capital requirement for Metro Rod which is unusual in a franchise business.
Customers
Metro Rod serves national business customers across multiple sectors including facilities management, retail, water utilities, social housing, hospitality and insurance, as well as local businesses and other customers in the private and public sectors. Customers include many large national and well-known companies. Domestic customers form only a small part of Metro Rod’s business.
In the last three financial years, Metro Rod Franchisees have carried out over 100,000 jobs per annum. In the financial year ended 30 April 2016, more than 130,000 jobs were completed. Average gross revenue per job in the financial year ended 30 April 2016 was approximately £230 (excluding VAT). Total system sales were approximately £32 million in the financial year ended 30 April 2016 (unaudited).
Statutory revenues for Metro Rod in the financial year ended 30 April 2016 were £21.4 million, and proforma revenues, which include the contribution of Kemac, and other adjustments, were £23.0 million. Of the proforma £23.0 million, £18.4 million related to revenue from Key Accounts, £2.6 million from Commercial Accounts and £1.8 million from Kemac. Key Account sales relate to national customer accounts won and maintained by the Metro Rod central sales team. Commercial Accounts relate to work secured directly by the Franchisee primarily from commercial customers within their franchise area as a result of their local marketing initiatives.
Key Accounts
Metro Rod has over 360 Key Account customers. In the financial year ended 30 April 2016, facilities
management customers accounted for approximately 51 per cent. of total Key Account customer revenues and retail customers accounted for approximately 12 per cent. Metro Rod has a high customer retention rate. In the last three financial years, the retention rate for Key Account customers was over 93 per cent.
Key Account customers include many large national and well-known companies in the facilities management, hospitality, healthcare and construction sectors. In the financial year ended 30 April 2016, Metro Rod’s top 10 Key Account customers accounted for 35 per cent. of total revenue. As a result, the Directors believe there is limited dependence on any one individual Key Account customer. The largest customer accounts for approximately 9 per cent. of total revenues and has been a customer for 12 years.
Key Account contracts are generally organised through a framework or preferred supplier agreement, which have a typical duration of one to three years. While the agreements do not generally include volume guarantees, they document call-out rates, which tend to be fixed through the duration of the agreements. The call-out rates vary by customer. Key Account prices are set nationally and are mandatory on all Franchisees.
To use Metro Rod’s services, Key Account customers report an issue to the 24/7/365 central call centre, which allocates a job to the relevant Franchisee. The customer is invoiced by Metro Rod’s head office which also collects payment, retaining an approximate margin of 22 per cent. While the MSF is set as 22.5 per cent., the margin is 22 per cent. as Metro Rod allows Franchisees to exclude certain allowable expenses in calculating the MSF. The remaining approximately 78 per cent. is paid to the Franchisee, which is treated as a direct cost to Metro Rod in its accounts. The full invoice value is recorded as revenue by Metro Rod.
Commercial Accounts
Franchisees service approximately 2,000 Commercial Account customers. Commercial Account sales are an important focus of Franchisee business plans. However, Franchisees must service Key Accounts ahead of Commercial Accounts.
There is no typical Commercial Account although they include small and medium sized enterprises in the franchise territory, local public sector institutions such as county councils, hospitals and educational establishments and non-profit organisations such as housing associations and charities. Key characteristics of a quality commercial customer are: a repeat element to their business; a high footfall on their premises; premises that are sensitive to disruption from drainage problems; or customers that have a budget allocated through public funding.
Metro Rod’s head office is responsible for raising the sales invoice in respect of Commercial Accounts on behalf of the Franchisee and collecting payment. Following payment by the customer, approximately 22 per cent. is retained by Metro Rod, i.e., the MSF of 22.5 per cent. minus the allowance for deductible items, and the remainder is passed on to the Franchisee providing the service. Only the MSF is taken to statutory income by Metro Rod and therefore Commercial Accounts effectively generate a 100 per cent. gross profit margin.
THE MARKET FOR METRO ROD’S SERVICES
Drainage
The drain clearance and maintenance market is well established. According to a report by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in 2012 the UK had over 624,200 kilometres of sewers and these collected approximately 11 billion litres of waste water on a daily basis. According to Water UK, there are approximately 366,000 sewer blockages a year in the UK.
Drainage system blockages can be caused by a number of factors, including a build-up of silt, sewage, general debris, fat, oil or grease or blockages caused by materials or objects which are unsuitable for flushing.
Structural problems with drains can be caused by subsidence, tree root intrusion, pipe corrosion or breakage. In addition, when there is heavy or prolonged rainfall, flooding may occur and drains may be subjected to large amounts of water, which can lead to blockages. These problems can become exacerbated if drains have not been properly cleaned out or maintained. The UK’s dated drainage system is also a contributing factor.
The Key Accounts that Metro Rod services operate in large and well established markets. They include facilities management companies, retailers, water companies, social housing providers and hospitality and construction companies. Approximately 80 per cent. of Metro Rod’s services are provided on a reactive basis and therefore the Directors believe that consistency of availability of the service and speed of completion is key. The latter is key when drainage is critical to the business or sensitive to disruption, for example businesses which have customer footfall. The Directors also believe that price is a consideration for customers in these sectors.
The Directors believe that Metro Rod is one of only five companies in its field operating on a national basis. The other four companies are Dyno Rod, Lanes for Drains, Ansa Drainage Solutions and Drain Doctor. Summary information on each key competitor is provided below.




●


Dyno Rod: Dyno Rod is part of the Dyno group of businesses, which was founded in 1963 and acquired by Centrica plc in 2004. Dyno is a 24/7/365 emergency response provider of drainage, plumbing and heating services. It established itself in the drainage market before moving into plumbing and heating and serves both individual and commercial customers. Dyno has approximately 45 franchisees nationwide. Within Centrica plc, Dyno is part of British Gas and Scottish Gas.








●


Lanes for Drains: Lanes for Drains provides a full range of drainage clearance and maintenance services available 24/7/365 for domestic and commercial clients. According to the business, it is the largest independent drainage specialist in the UK, and operates from a network of regional depots nationwide. Lanes for Drains is part of the Lanes Group plc, a wastewater solutions provider which operates across a range of sectors including drainage emergencies, drainage maintenance, rehabilitation and renewal, consultancy and waste management services.








●


Ansa Drainage Solutions: Ansa Drainage Solutions offers a 24/7/365 drain clearing and maintenance services for households and commercial clients, as well as a full range of clean water distribution service for customers in the infrastructure sector. In addition, Ansa Drainage Solutions is a leading provider of outsourced drainage solutions to the UK insurance and claims management industries. It is part of the Independent Group (UK) Ltd, which provides a range of services within the domestic, commercial and insurance markets.








●


Drain Doctor: Drain Doctor is a full service plumbing and drainage maintenance company. It provides a 24/7/365 drainage clearance and repair service to domestic and commercial customers and preventative maintenance plans for commercial customers. It also provides cold water plumbing services to domestic and commercial customers. Drain Doctor has been established in the UK since 1994 and has approximately 45 franchisees nationwide. The master franchise licence for Drain Doctor in the UK is ultimately owned by Dwyer Group, a US holding company of 11 service-based franchise organisations worldwide.




Plumbing
Plumbing is a large and mature market and encompasses a wide range of services including central heating services, general plumbing, industrial plumbing and renewable energy services. According to IBIS World, in the UK:




●


the plumbing, heating and air conditioning installation industry typically accounts for approximately 15 per cent. of specialised construction trade activities;








●


the total value of the general plumbing market, measured by revenue, is estimated to be £15.6 billion in 2016-2017;








●


the largest segment of the market is central heating services (43.5 per cent.), an area which Metro Plumb does not yet service; and








●


the size of the general plumbing market, which covers the services Metro Plumb provides, is estimated to be £3.6 billion in 2016-2017.




In reality however, not all of this market would be available to Metro Plumb as it is not Metro Rod’s intention to enter certain sectors such as the bathroom installation market.
According to IBIS World, the plumbing market in the UK is highly fragmented with over 30,000 enterprises. Large national providers who are active in this market place include Drain Doctor and Dyno Plumbing (part of the Dyno range of services), which have been referred to above, as well as HomeServe. These largescale providers compete with Metro Plumb.
HomeServe provides a multi-service emergency repair offering to domestic customers as part of an insurance-based membership model. This service offering includes drainage and plumbing as well as other services such as electrical-related, gas and central heating and home security emergencies and repairs. Services are performed by a combination of employees, franchisees and sub-contractors.
Mitton Group and Pimlico Plumbers are examples of companies which the Directors consider compete with Metro Rod on a regional basis:




●


Mitton Group, a building service specialist, provides a range of professional service solutions including preventive planned maintenance and emergency call-out facilities. Plumbing is one of the services provided together with commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning installations. Mitton Group is a privately owned company based in West Yorkshire;








●


according to Pimlico Plumbers, it is London’s largest independent plumbing and service company, providing a wide range of services including plumbing, drains services, electrics, appliances, carpentry, building and roofing. Plumbing services are available on a 24/7/365 basis.




The majority of firms in the market are small, local operators.

INFORMATION ON FRANCHISE BRANDS
Franchise Brands is a group of international multi-brand franchisors with a combined network of over 400 Franchisees in 12 countries, but predominantly in the UK.
The Group’s principal brands are ChipsAway, Ovenclean and Barking Mad, all of which deliver services to individuals of a similar socio-economic group through the Group’s Franchisees. The Group does not currently own or operate any franchises.
The business of the Group was founded in September 2008 by Stephen Hemsley (Executive Chairman) and Nigel Wray (Non-Executive Director), the Group’s Controlling Shareholders, who have substantial experience in franchising.
Since 2008, the Group has developed central support services predominantly in the areas of marketing, franchise recruitment and franchise support.
The Group’s strategy is to increase its portfolio of franchise brands through acquisition as well as grow its existing businesses. In October 2016, the Group announced the completion of its first acquisition since IPO, Barking Mad.
In addition to the co-founders, other members of the Board also have considerable franchising experience as well as experience of operating and growing profitable businesses. The Board also has substantial experience of analysing, investigating, completing and integrating acquisitions.
The Group is profitable and cash generative. The financial information set out below has been extracted without material adjustment from the consolidated historical financial information on the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and FB Holdings for each of the two years ended 31 December 2014 and 2015 as referenced in the Admission Document:

ENLARGED GROUP STRATEGY
The strategy of the Enlarged Group is to develop franchise businesses that provide primarily services to individuals and businesses. The execution of the strategy will be achieved through organic growth and acquisition.
Metro Rod
The Enlarged Group intends to develop the Metro Rod business in a number of areas, including:




●


providing additional sales and marketing support to Franchisees in the development of Commercial Accounts;








●


further developing Key Accounts in sectors where Metro Rod’s penetration could be increased on a relative basis;








●


developing Metro Plumb through investment in additional sales and marketing; and








●


longer term, extending the “Metro” brand into other B2B service sectors.




Barking Mad
The Directors believe there is substantial scope to grow Barking Mad’s system sales by supporting Franchisees’ growth through leveraging the Group’s established central support services, in particular marketing. The Directors also believe there is an opportunity over time to increase the number of franchised territories from the current 77 territories to over 250 territories. The Group also intends to explore opportunities to extend the Barking Mad brand in related segments of the market.
ChipsAway and Ovenclean
The Enlarged Group intends to continue to actively expand the ChipsAway and Ovenclean franchise systems through recruiting new Franchisees as well as improving Franchisee retention rates. The Directors believe this will improve the quality of earnings by increasing the contribution from recurring MSF income. The Enlarged Group aims to continue to support existing Franchisees, in particular existing ChipsAway Franchisees who wish to grow their businesses through the development of CarCare Centres.
MyHome
During 2016, the Group continued to trial the MyHome brand to establish if a full relaunch would be
economically worthwhile. The total costs incurred in 2016 were £92,000. The Directors concluded that a full re-launch of the domestic cleaning business would not be in Shareholders’ long term interest given the damage previously done to the brand and a number of other parties using all or part of the MyHome name. These costs will therefore not recur in future years. The Group’s research did, however, highlight other opportunities in the domestic services sector, particularly for small repairs and maintenance. To test this opportunity, the Group has a single franchisee operating under the brand “The Handyman Van” using similar branding to MyHome. This test will be cost neutral for the Group.
Acquisitions
The Enlarged Group intends to grow by acquisition focusing on both B2B and B2C franchisee businesses where the Directors believe that the Enlarged Group’s financial and management resources can add value, in particular to businesses which have the following characteristics:




●


a market presence has been established, however, the businesses have reached a level where the existing management cannot grow them further;








●


sales and marketing resources are not economically available;








●


the next stage of growth will require the investment of additional capital not available to the existing owners; and








●


in addition to one or more of the requirements above, the shareholders of the businesses wish to achieve a realisation of their investment or convert their investment into a more marketable form.




The Directors believe the acquisition of Metro Rod is a transformational step in the Group’s buy and build strategy, and brings with it a number of exciting potential opportunities. The Directors believe the development of these opportunities, which are anticipated to include the need for investment in marketing and information technology, as well as require significant senior management time, should remain the near term focus of the Enlarged Group.
CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS
Franchise Brands
The Group announced its audited annual results for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 on 23 March 2017.
Since 1 January 2017, the Group has continued to trade in line with management expectations and the Board expects this to continue through the rest of 2017.
The Directors believe that the Enlarged Group’s prospects will be enhanced by the Acquisition as well as the Group’s recent acquisition of Barking Mad. The Directors believe that the integration of Barking Mad into the Group is progressing well and that it is beginning to benefit from the Group’s support services particularly in the areas of marketing and IT.
A further update on the Enlarged Group’s results for the six-month period ending 30 June 2017 will be provided in the Enlarged Group’s next interim accounts, which will be published not later than 30 September 2017.
The total number of ChipsAway and Ovenclean Franchisees in the UK has increased by over 15 over the last year and with the acquisition of Barking Mad, the total number of UK Franchisees as at the date of the Admission Document stands at 395.
Metro Rod
Since 1 November 2016, Metro Rod has continued to trade in line with the previous year despite very dry weather, particularly in December 2016, which has had a negative effect on reactive drainage services.
The Directors believe that under the guidance of the Board, and as part of a group focused entirely on the development and growth of franchise businesses, the development of Metro Rod can be accelerated.
The total number of Franchisees within Metro Rod has remained stable since 30 April 2016, at around 40.
PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ACQUISITION
Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Company has conditionally agreed to acquire Metro Rod for a cash consideration of £28 million, payable in full at completion of the Acquisition (which takes place on Admission) subject to certain adjustments based on the financial position of Metro Rod at completion.
The Acquisition Agreement contains customary warranties and indemnities from the Vendor in favour of the Company subject to certain limitations, in particular as to the maximum amounts which may be claimed. The Company has taken out warranty and indemnity insurance to provide additional protection in respect of any claims that may arise under such warranties and indemnities.
FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE ACQUISITION
In the year ended 30 April 2016, Metro Rod recorded an Operating Profit before exceptional items of approximately £3.2 million. The Consideration therefore represents a multiple of approximately 8.8 times Operating Profit before exceptional items, which the Directors consider attractive for a business where they believe they can add significantly to sales and profit growth.
In addition to the Consideration, the Company will incur total costs for the Acquisition, Placing and Admission of approximately £1.8 million, resulting in a total funding requirement of £29.8 million. The Acquisition, Placing and Admission will be funded by the Placing and the Term Loan.
It is anticipated that the net assets of Metro Rod at completion of the Acquisition will be approximately£8 million, giving rise to a maximum goodwill of £20 million. Consideration will be given to the valuation of trademarks and other intangible assets in calculating the final goodwill amount. Transaction costs will be written off or charged against the share premium account arising on the issue of new shares. In accordance with IFRS accounting standards, the life of trademarks and intangible assets will be assessed and will be subject to either amortisation or periodic impairment reviews.
The Company also intends to repay the outstanding balance of the Loan Notes, which stood at £0.4 million at 31 December 2016, prior to Admission. Repayment of the Loan Notes will be funded from the Group’s existing cash resources. Repayment of the Loan Notes will allow HSBC to be the only lender to the Enlarged Group (with the exception of a small hire purchase debt of approximately £0.1 million).
Shareholders’ funds at 31 December 2016 for the Company stood at £3.9 million. The addition of £20 million of new equity capital (less all transaction costs) will increase this to £22.1 million. The Term Loan will be the only borrowings of the Enlarged Group at completion of the Acquisition (with the exception of a small hire purchase debt of approximately £0.1 million). The Company’s cash balances at 31 December 2016 were £2.6 million (after adjusting for the repayment of the Loan Notes). Net capital gearing at completion of the Acquisition will therefore be approximately 46 per cent.
Operating Profit before exceptional items of the Group in the year to 31 December 2016 was £1.2 million and was £3.2 million for Metro Rod in the year ended 30 April 2016, giving a total pro forma Operating Profit before exceptional items in the last full financial year for the Enlarged Group of £4.4 million. At completion of the Acquisition, the ratio of net debt to Operating Profit before exceptional items will therefore be 1.6 times.
THE BOARD
The Board currently consists of seven Directors who, between them, have substantial experience of franchising, and the Board composition will not change as a result of the Acquisition. Stephen Hemsley and Nigel Wray have a longstanding and successful track record in investing in and growing franchise businesses dating back to 1999. The Directors also have considerable experience of operating and growing profitable businesses and of investigating acquisition targets.
In light of the acquisition of Barking Mad following the IPO, the proposed acquisition of Metro Rod and the planned growth for the Enlarged Group, the Directors intend to monitor the Board composition over the coming year to ensure it remains suitable for the needs of the Enlarged Group. Each of the Enlarged Group’s businesses has its own senior management team and finance function that report (or are expected to report) into the Board.
BANKING AND LOAN ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has entered into the Facilities Agreement with HSBC under which HSBC is to make available to the Company the Term Loan and the RCF to support the Acquisition and provide working capital finance to the Enlarged Group. The facilities are repayable within five years of Admission. The facilities are secured by cross guarantees and debentures executed by the Company and each of its non-dormant subsidiaries (“Subsidiaries”). The Facilities Agreement contains certain warranties and information, financial and general undertakings, from the Company and its Subsidiaries in favour of HSBC. HSBC has certain rights to terminate the Facilities Agreement and demand immediate repayment of all moneys and liabilities upon an occurrence of certain events of default as set out in the Facilities Agreement.
INFORMATION ON THE PLACING
The Company is proposing to raise up to approximately £20 million (approximately £18.2 million net of expenses) by the conditional placing of up to 29,850,747 Placing Shares pursuant to the Placing at the Placing Price. The net proceeds of the Placing will be used to satisfy part of the Consideration payable pursuant to the Acquisition.
The Placing Shares will represent approximately 38.4 per cent. of the Enlarged Share Capital on Admission and rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of the Ordinary Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, the Placing Shares will not be eligible to receive the final dividend in respect of the financial year ended on 31 December 2016 as proposed in the Group’s annual results announcement.
Allenby Capital and Dowgate Capital have each conditionally agreed, pursuant to the Placing Agreement and as agent for the Company, to use their reasonable endeavours to procure institutional and other subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Placing Price. The Placing has not been underwritten and is conditional, inter alia, upon the passing of the Resolutions, Admission and the Placing Agreement not being terminated by 8.00 a.m. on 11 April 2017 (and in any event no later than 8.30 a.m. on 28 April 2017). The Placing Agreement contains certain warranties and indemnities from the Company in favour of Allenby Capital and Dowgate Capital in relation, inter alia, to the accuracy of the information contained in the Admission Document and certain matters relating to the Group and Metro Rod. Allenby Capital and Dowgate Capital each have certain rights to terminate the Placing Agreement prior to Admission, including for in the opinion of Allenby Capital or Dowgate Capital (acting in good faith) a material breach of warranty or the occurrence of certain force majeure events as would be likely in the opinion of Allenby Capital and Dowgate Capital (acting in good faith) to materially prejudice the success of the Placing, Acquisition and Admission.
ADMISSION TO AIM
Pursuant to rule 14 of the AIM Rules, an application will be made for the Company’s Existing Ordinary Shares to be re-admitted to trading and the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM. It is expected that the last day of trading on AIM of the Existing Ordinary Shares will be on 10 April 2017 and that Admission will become effective and dealings in the Enlarged Share Capital will commence on 11 April 2017.
GENERAL MEETING
A notice convening a general meeting of the Company, to be held at the offices of Gateley Plc, One Paternoster Square, London EC4M 7DX on 10 April 2017 at 10.00 a.m., will be set out at the end of the Admission Document.
At the General Meeting, the following resolutions will be proposed:
(a) to approve the Acquisition;
(b) to authorise the Directors to: (i) allot Ordinary Shares in connection with the Placing and (ii) allot Ordinary Shares up to a maximum nominal value of £129,553, representing approximately 33 per cent. of the Enlarged Share Capital; and
(c) to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for cash otherwise than on a pro rata basis to Shareholders: (i) in connection with the Placing; and (ii) up to a maximum nominal value of £58,299, representing approximately 15 per cent. of the Enlarged Share Capital.
The resolutions in (a) and (b) will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and the resolution in (c) will be proposed as a special resolution. To be passed, the resolutions in (a) and (b) require a majority of the votes cast at the General Meeting, in person or by proxy, and the resolution referred to in (c) requires a majority of not less than 75 per cent. of the votes cast at the General Meeting, in person or by proxy. The Resolutions are interconditional and so, if one of them is not passed at the General Meeting, none of them will be deemed to have been passed.
RECOMMENDATION AND IRREVOCABLE UNDERTAKINGS
The Directors consider the Acquisition to be an excellent opportunity for the Group and in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors recommend unanimously that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting as they and certain other Shareholders have irrevocably undertaken to do so in respect of their beneficial holdings of Ordinary Shares, which represent approximately 70.34 per cent of the Existing Ordinary Shares.

The rights and obligations of the Placees will not be subject to termination by the Placee or any prospective Placee at any time or in any circumstances. By participating in the Placing, Placees agree that the exercise by the Joint Bookrunners of any right of termination or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and that they need not make any reference to Placees and that neither of the Joint Bookrunners nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise.
No Prospectus
The Placing Shares are being offered to a limited number of specifically invited persons only and have not been nor will be offered in such a way as to require the publication of a prospectus in the United Kingdom or in any other jurisdiction. No prospectus has been or will be submitted to be approved by the FCA in relation to the Placing, and Placees’ commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in the Announcement (including this Appendix), the Admission Document and the business and financial information that the Company is required to publish in accordance with the AIM Rules on or prior to the date of this Announcement (the “Exchange Information”). Each Placee, by accepting a participation in the Placing, agrees that the content of this Announcement and the Admission Document is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and the Directors and confirms that it has neither received nor relied on any other information (other than the Exchange Information), representation, warranty, or statement made by or on behalf of the Company or the Joint Bookrunners or any other person and neither the Joint Bookrunners nor the Company nor any other person will be liable for any Placee’s decision to participate in the Placing based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement which the Placees may have obtained or received and, if given or made, such information, representation, warranty or statement must not be relied upon as having been authorised by the Joint Bookrunners, the Company, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents. Each Placee acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in accepting a participation in the Placing. Neither the Company nor the Joint Bookrunners are making any undertaking or warranty to any Placee regarding the legality of an investment in the Placing Shares by such Placee under any legal, investment or similar laws or regulations. Each Placee should not consider any information in this Announcement or the Admission Document to be legal, tax or business advice. Each Placee should consult its own solicitor, tax adviser and financial adviser for independent legal, tax and financial advice regarding an investment in the Placing Shares. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation.
Registration and Settlement
Following the close of the Bookbuild, each Placee allocated Placing Shares in the Placing will be sent a trade confirmation or contract note in accordance with the standing arrangements in place with the relevant Joint Bookrunner, stating the number of Placing Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price, the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to the relevant Joint Bookrunner (in GBP) and a form of confirmation in relation to settlement instructions.
Each Placee will be deemed to agree that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed as directed by the relevant Joint Bookrunner in accordance with the standing CREST settlement instructions which they have in place with the relevant Joint Bookrunner.
Settlement of transactions in the Placing Shares (ISIN: GB00BD6P7Y24) following Admission will take place within the system administered by Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (“CREST”) provided that, subject to certain exceptions, the Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to require settlement for, and delivery of, the Placing Shares (or a portion thereof) to Placees by such other means that they deem necessary if delivery or settlement is not possible or practicable within CREST within the timetable set out in this Announcement or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in any Placee’s jurisdiction.
It is expected that settlement will be on 11 April 2017 on a T+13 basis in accordance with the instructions set out in the form of confirmation.
Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of two percentage points above LIBOR as determined by the Joint Bookrunners.
Each Placee is deemed to agree that, if it does not comply with these obligations, the Joint Bookrunners may sell any or all of the Placing Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee’s behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the Joint Bookrunners’ account and benefit (as agents for the Company), an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or securities transfer tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee’s behalf. By communicating a bid for Placing Shares, each Placee confers on the relevant Joint Bookrunner such authorities and powers necessary to carry out any such sale and agrees to ratify and confirm all actions which the Joint Bookrunners lawfully take in pursuance of such sale.
If Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the form of confirmation or contract note is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation.
Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee’s name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or securities transfer tax.  Neither of the Joint Bookrunners nor the Company will be liable in any circumstances for the payment of stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or securities transfer tax in connection with any of the Placing Shares.  Placees will not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Placing.

4. these terms and conditions and any agreements entered into by it pursuant to these terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and it submits (on behalf of itself and on behalf of any person on whose behalf it is acting) to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts as regards any claim, dispute or matter arising out of any such contract, except that enforcement proceedings in respect of the obligation to make payment for the Placing Shares (together with any interest chargeable thereon) may be taken by the Company or the Joint Bookrunners in any jurisdiction in which the relevant Placee is incorporated or in which any of its securities have a quotation on a recognised stock exchange;

The agreement to settle a Placee’s subscription (and/or the subscription of a person for whom such Placee is contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax depends on the settlement relating only to a subscription by it and/or such person direct from the Company for the Placing Shares in question. Such agreement assumes that the Placing Shares are not being subscribed for in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement relates to any other subsequent dealing in the Placing Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax may be payable, for which neither the Company nor the Joint Bookrunners will be responsible, and the Placee to whom (or on behalf of whom, or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax undertakes to pay such UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company and the Joint Bookrunners in the event that any of the Company and/or the Joint Bookrunners has incurred any such liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and notify the Joint Bookrunners accordingly.
In addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any stamp duty and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) payable outside the UK by them or any other person on the subscription by them for any Placing Shares or the agreement by them to subscribe for any Placing Shares.
Each Placee, and any person acting on its behalf, acknowledges that the Joint Bookrunners owe no fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings or indemnities in the Placing Agreement.
Each Placee and any person acting on its behalf, acknowledges and agrees that the Joint Bookrunners or any of its respective affiliates may, at their absolute discretion, agree to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the Placing Shares.

About Us
The business of Franchise Brands plc was founded in September 2008 by Stephen Hemsley (Executive Chairman) and Nigel Wray (Non-Executive Director), the principal shareholders, who have substantial experience in franchising.
Their vision was to create a group of complementary franchise businesses that could benefit from sharing the same central support services, thus allowing the management of these businesses to focus on expanding their networks, and supporting their franchisees to grow their businesses.
The founders’ vision also incorporated their strongly held belief that a franchise business can only be reliably and successfully expanded if the unit level economics are viable at the franchisee level and franchisees are able to build profitable businesses with the support of the franchisor.
The Group’s strategy is to focus on the development of franchise businesses that primarily provide services to individuals and businesses, building on our core skills of marketing, franchise recruitment and franchise support. The execution of the strategy will be achieved through organic growth and acquisition.
In October 2016, Franchise Brands completed its first acquisition since the IPO, of Barking Mad, in October 2016. This broadened the Group’s portfolio of B2C businesses with a market leading brand which has an attractive model for franchisees, a strong management team and a similar customer base to the Group’s existing brands.
