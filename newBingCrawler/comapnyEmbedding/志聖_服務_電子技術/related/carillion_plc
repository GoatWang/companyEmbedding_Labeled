		About	


The installation of Telematics in to all of Carillion’s commercial vehicles is aimed at helping you manage your driving, with the support of your supervisor.
Objectives include:

Getting you home safely at the end of a day’s work
Minimising our environmental impact
Reducing fuel usage

Carillion has long had a policy of helping drivers to reduce risk on the road, through general support and advice on how to drive safely throughout the year. Until now it has not been possible to monitor driver behaviour and provide individual support to every driver. With the installation of telematics in all commercial vehicles this is now possible.
In addition, Carillion’s 2020 Sustainability program has set a target of 50% reduction in fuel usage by 2015. To help achieve these aims Carillion Fleet Management are installing Telematics in all commercial vehicles to monitor driving behaviours.
Telematics will play a key role in Carillion’s Driver Improvement Program. It works by providing data on driving style and is scored against specific driving performance criteria based on Engine revs, Idling, Acceleration, Braking and Speeding, all of which affect the average Miles Per Gallon (MPG), whilst also providing an indication of the driver’s risk profile.
The scores are averaged with a target score of 90, which demonstrates an efficient and safe driving style.
In addition to Telematics, the engines in many commercial vehicles are also being retuned to optimize their performance for UK conditions which will further improve fuel consumption, using a product called FuelSaver.
