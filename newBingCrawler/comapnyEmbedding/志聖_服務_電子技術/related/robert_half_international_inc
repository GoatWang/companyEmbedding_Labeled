History[edit]





This section needs expansion with: information on the company's products, performance, leadership, and status, in particular, for years other than 1948 and 1986-2003. You can help by adding to it. (February 2017)


The company's founding was in 1948,[5] in New York City,[1][self-published source] with its original name being variously reported as being Robert Half Inc., Robert Half Finance & Accounting,[5] and Robert Half Personnel Agency.[1][self-published source] The founding, in any case, is reported to have been of two separate business entities, the Robert Half (RH) portion as "an employment agency for accountants," and the Accountemps portion "to supply accountants and other financial professionals… on a temporary basis."[5] Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern, and saw an opportunity as no placement agency had been focusing on this sector of the market.[1][self-published source]
In the mid- to late-1980s, Robert Half (RH) altered its prior focus—which had been like that of the field in general—from relatively undifferentiated temporary clerical and light industry staffing, to providing temporary workers at higher skill levels via new "professional staffing divisions".[6][self-published source] Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993.[5] In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel.[5] Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of "The Affiliates, a firm in Southern California that placed temporary and permanent paralegal, legal administrative, and other legal support personnel," with it being renamed as Robert Half Legal.[5]
Robert Half went on to establish itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment,[when?] with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts.[5]
In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen.[5][7] Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,900 staff,[8][self-published source] and continues to be led by Andersen alumni.[citation needed]
In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations.[5]
Published works[edit]
Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring books on the industry—such as Making It Big in Data Processing[full citation needed] and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World[full citation needed]—was continued by the CEO of this date,[when?] Harold M. "Max" Messmer,[citation needed] in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies.[full citation needed][5]
