Weâ€™re living in a new world of work. Technology is developing and changing at an exponential pace. New generations are entering into the workforce. Mobility is rapidly increasing and there is a greater need for access to information wherever you are. Organizational changes, downsizing, cost containment, the list goes on.
	Are you dealing with unprecedented changes while still trying to be efficient and productive? Are you looking for innovative approaches to stay ahead of competition?
	Start by looking at your business processes, technology and tools. Today, they can no longer be static and information-centric.
	Operations must fundamentally shift to people-centric. They must enable options for people to communicate and work together.
	With our deep expertise in capturing, transforming and managing information, we deliver services for a dynamic workforce that are changing the way people work today, and make information accessible where and when itâ€™s needed.

Welcome to the Macadamia Processing Company (MPC). We are a macadamia processor that is focused on providing the highest quality macadamias to customers and consumers world wide. MPC’s wholesale products are available through our Marketing Company, Macadamia Marketing International (MMI) and retail products are available through this website or directly from our factory door.
We are committed to ensuring the long term sustainability of our industry by providing customers with the highest quality macadamias and growers with strong prices, innovative services and excellent advice.


Owned By Growers
MPC was established by a group of 4 macadamia growers in 1983 and has grown to be wholly owned by over 160 macadamia grower shareholders. We processes between 10-13,000 metric tonnes of macadamia nuts annually (approx 20-30% of the Australian crop) in our state of the art factory located near Lismore on the Northern Rivers NSW. Our supply comes from orchards located in Northern New South wales and South East Queensland, which is the evolutionary home of the macadamia tree.

Unique to Australia
Our grower's and their orchards are located on Australia's east coast in some of the most beautiful rainforest and subtropical environments. This is the area where macadamias, which are native to Australia, were first discovered.

Healthy & Delicious
Macadamias contain the highest levels of monounsaturated fat (the "good fat") of all nuts, as well as a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, as well as protein and fibre, but contain no cholesterol. Macadamias are a delicious, healthy, natural food.

MPC Services (UK) Limited is a family business based in the Midlands. It was formed in 1993 initially to provide a nationwide service supplying and fitting non mains drainage sewage treatment systems and pumping stations.
 
From speaking to customers who had breakdowns and problems with their existing systems, it became apparent that the lack of regular servicing was a major factor in the failure of the units, some of which had been installed many years ago. From this was born the servicing side of the business where bespoke maintenance plans are offered to all customers to allow them to have peace of mind so that should a failure occur, an engineer would be on site as soon as possible.
 
We now have a fully dedicated installations department and have carried out installations of all units on the market nationwide. Over the years we have excelled at ensuring the works are carried out to the highest quality, therefore have gained a following of many happy customers who appreciate the personal touch we have to offer alongside our professional standards of service.
We offer sewage treatment plants from all of the major manufacturers and we have a dedicated team on hand to help you size up and choose the most suitable one for you and your project.
Shop Sewage Treatment Plants

We also design and manufacture our own range of effluent and crude pump stations, using German engineered KSB and ultra-reliable Calpeda pumps.
 
We offer a fully comprehensive range ex stock. Alongside our pump stations we also offer a full range of suitable accessories including fittings, pipework and control panel equipment which will help you finish off your project without the hassle of using multiple suppliers.
Shop Pump Stations
Here at MPC Services (UK) Ltd we offer a full range of pumps and spare parts for a vast majority of waste water systems and pump units

MPC Services (UK) Ltd has dedicated teams throughout the UK specialising in

MPC Services (UK) Ltd is a different type of company to the servicing departments of most manufacturing companies. We do not maintain just one manufacturer's products, but look after our client's entire range of sewage treatment plants, septic tanks, filter beds, pumping stations, rainwater harvesters and associated equipment. MPC Services (UK) Ltd has been installing and maintaining sewage treatment plants, pumping stations etc since 1994. A recent check showed that 18 of our first 20 clients remain under contract to this day, a testament to the level of customer service offered.
 
We now carry out 2500 scheduled and non-scheduled service visits a year and have a database of over 1000 satisfied customers.
 
For full details on all our services, annual Maintenance Agreements & prices please contact Sophie on 01773 767612 or email sophiem@mpcservices.co.uk.
There are many reasons your wastewater system may be failing, from lack of proper maintenance to it just being old and dilapidated. If your wastewater treatment system, pump station or soakaway fail it doesn't necessarily mean you require a whole new system. You could save thousands of pounds by simply having it refurbished. MPC Services (UK) Ltd service over 2000 wastewater systems & pump stations annually so we have all the experience you need to get your system back to working form.

We specialise in Klargester BioDiscs, BioSafes & BioTecs, along with Tricel, Balmoral and Conder to name but a few. MPC Services work with systems of all sizes so you can rest assured that whether you have a small residential sewage treatment plant or a large commercial pump station we have the skills to get it functioning properly again.


































  
                        Thank you very much for the Maintenance Service your company have provided us with during the past seven years. 
We have always found your Office Staff and Site Engineers very cooperative and obliging, particularly when problems have occurred with the pumps and equipment, sometimes resulting in emergency call outs. 
Your costs have also been kept very low over this time. We would certainly recommend your services to anyone requiring pump maintenance.

About UsIncorporated in 1991, MPC (Modern Process Control) Consulting Ltd. has been headquartered in Sidney, British Columbia since 2000. Prior to that, we were based out of Richmond BC. Paul Bulmer is the founder and President of the company, with over 30 years of experience in instrumentation and process control design engineering.
Engineering and Systems Integration
MPC Consulting is dedicated to providing engineering and systems integration of control systems, instrumentation, and SCADA systems, for your industrial automation needs. For your control system needs, including SCADA, PLC, and DCS, we provide detailed engineering, specification, purchasing and complete programming (logic and graphics) of the entire system. We also install and provide maintenance services afterwards. MPC will produce all required engineering documentation and drawings (to ISA standards) to accompany the control system including P&ID drawings, logic drawings, wiring and cabling drawings, loop drawings, etc.
System Evaluation and Upgrade
Having problems with your existing systems? If so, MPC can troubleshoot it for you and provide a complete solution to get them back to optimal efficiency. We can also evaluate your existing systems and upgrade them to the latest technology to increase your product quality and yield, and decrease costly downtime.
Instrumentation Needs
For your instrumentation needs in these systems, we can specify the correct instruments for your application using the Instrumentation Database from Megaflex. We will purchase, install, and calibrate, and then provide full maintenance service for them, as required.
The Custom Panel Shop
Also in Sidney, BC, we own and operate The Custom Panel Shop, a subsidiary of MPC where we design and build custom electrical control panels  (CSA, UL or ETL certification can be offered if required) for any application. We can provide a complete engineered package for your control panel needs. With every panel, we include complete documentation, panel layout drawings, wiring drawings, BOMs, operation manuals, etc. We test system operation completely before the panel leaves our shop, including every input and output to make startup and field commissioning effortless. After commissioning, we ensure success by providing operator training and ongoing servicing of the system as required.
MPC Consulting Ltd. is a registered systems integrator in British Columbia for Control Microsystems & GE.
