DENVER, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TeleTech Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:   TTEC), a leading global provider of customer experience, engagement, and growth solutions delivered through its proprietary, end-to-end HumanifyTM Customer Engagement as a Service offering, today welcomes Jeff Marcoux as the company's Vice President of Product Marketing. Jeff will be responsible for the strategic evolution of its customer experience solutions and service design innovation.








Marcoux joins TeleTech from Microsoft, where he was responsible for developing marketing solutions, consulting on digital transformation and customer experience, and growing new SaaS solutions as the Senior Executive interface to Microsoft clients' CMOs.  Additionally, Marcoux is a prominent Customer Experience speaker, and an adjunct professor of marketing for UC Irvine & Oregon State University.   
"Digital transformation is no longer about adding channels, it's about designing services that deliver context to every interaction in a seamless, frictionless, meshed fashion so every interaction is personal, relevant, and engaging. Brands across the globe are seeking solutions to keep up with customer expectations of personalized, carefully orchestrated, seamless experiences," explains Kyle Priest, TeleTech's Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer.

With the goal of helping clients deliver service experiences that accelerate acquisition, growth, retention and affinity, he will be focused on innovations in omnichannel contextual knowledge management, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality."
"With customer experience being the key differentiator in businesses today, TeleTech is empowering brands to create experiences that turn customers into raving fans," said Marcoux. "Given the constant threat of digital disruption, companies need to look beyond digital transformation as a capability. It's the underlying service experiences that are the linchpin to sustained, scalable growth. Customer engagement is the most critical part of every successful transformation, and TeleTech has a proven ability to do this successfully on a global scale. Today, the company acts as brand ambassadors for its clients, not just envisioning and enabling engagement, but actually delivering it through human, digital, and automated customer engagement services. I am excited to join this team who shares my passion and vision for helping brands deliver experiences that reflect the very best of humanity."

Style Scores:



B Value | A Growth | C Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(NASDAQ: TTEC), a leading global provider of customer experience, engagement, and growth solutions delivered through its proprietary, end-to-end Humanify Customer Engagement as a Service offering, today welcomes Jeff Marcoux as the company's Vice President of Product Marketing. Jeff will be responsible for the strategic evolution of its customer experience solutions and service design innovation.
      

        Marcoux joins TeleTech from Microsoft, where he was responsible for developing marketing solutions, consulting on digital transformation and customer experience, and growing new SaaS solutions as the Senior Executive interface to Microsoft clients' CMOs.  Additionally, Marcoux is a prominent Customer Experience speaker, and an adjunct professor of marketing for UC Irvine & Oregon State University.   
      

        'Digital transformation is no longer about adding channels, it's about designing services that deliver context to every interaction in a seamless, frictionless, meshed fashion so every interaction is personal, relevant, and engaging. Brands across the globe are seeking solutions to keep up with customer expectations of personalized, carefully orchestrated, seamless experiences,' explains Kyle Priest, TeleTech's Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer.

        'With customer experience being the key differentiator in businesses today, TeleTech is empowering brands to create experiences that turn customers into raving fans,' said Marcoux. 'Given the constant threat of digital disruption, companies need to look beyond digital transformation as a capability. It's the underlying service experiences that are the linchpin to sustained, scalable growth. Customer engagement is the most critical part of every successful transformation, and TeleTech has a proven ability to do this successfully on a global scale. Today, the company acts as brand ambassadors for its clients, not just envisioning and enabling engagement, but actually delivering it through human, digital, and automated customer engagement services. I am excited to join this team who shares my passion and vision for helping brands deliver experiences that reflect the very best of humanity.'
