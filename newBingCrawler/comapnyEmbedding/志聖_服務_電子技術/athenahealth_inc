athenahealth, Inc. is a publicly traded American company that provides cloud-based services for health care and point-of-care mobile apps. The company was founded in 1997 in San Diego, California. athenahealth is headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, with operational sites in Belfast, Maine; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Princeton, New Jersey; and Chennai, India, and Bangalore, India.[1]
History[edit]
In 1997, athenahealth cofounders Jonathan Bush and Todd Park started Athena Women's Health, a women's health and birthing practice in San Diego, California. The practice encountered problems being reimbursed by payers. Lacking a system to track insurance claims, Bush and Park formed athenahealth, Inc. to develop a practice management system.[2] Todd's brother, software developer Ed Park, helped to develop a revenue cycle management system with a "rules engine" of dynamic billing rules data. In 2000, athenahealth introduced athenaCollector, its cloud-based revenue cycle and practice management service.[3]
In 2006, the company launched athenaClinicals, reported as the "first economically sustainable, service-based" electronic medical records (EMR) system.[4] athenahealth, Inc. announced an initial public offering of its common stock on June 22, 2007.[5] The offering was completed on September 20, 2007, at a price of $18 per share. It trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ATHN.[6]
In 2008, athenahealth introduced athenaCommunicator to manage phone calls.[7] Since then, the product has evolved into a suite of "patient engagement services", including a patient portal, population health campaign tool, scheduling solution, and answering service. athenahealth purchased Anodyne Health in 2009.[8] The Anodyne Health services were incorporated into athenaCoordinator Analytics, an analytics service for medical groups and health systems.
athenahealth's More Disruption Please program was launched in 2011. The initiative is both a partner program and an incubator environment for independent companies to develop products and services connected to athenahealth's ecosystem.[9]
In 2011, athenahealth purchased Proxsys, LLC, a care coordination company, and launched athenaCoordinator (now athenaCoordinator Core) for order transmission and care collaboration with secure text message.[10] In 2012, the company purchased Healthcare Data Services, a population health management company.[11] The company launched athenaCoordinator Enterprise (now athena Population Health) in 2014 to design end-to-end care coordination and population health service for enterprises.
In 2013, the company purchased the Epocrates mobile brand.[12] Epocrates is now an athenahealth service for clinical decision support in the moments of care.
On January 14, 2015, athenahealth announced the acquisition of RazorInsights, a "leader in cloud-based EHR and financial solutions" for rural, critical access, and community hospitals. The purchase extended athenahealth’s established position in the outpatient market into the 50-bed and under inpatient care environment, which makes up nearly one third of the hospital market.[13] In February 2015, athenahealth announced that it had purchased webOMR, the web-based clinical applications and EHR platform developed by Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. athenahealth collaborated with BIDMC on the development of athenahealth's acute care service offering, using Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, a 58-bed community hospital, as the alpha development site.[14]
athenahealth was named 2015/2016 Best in KLAS for mid-sized ambulatory EMR software.[15]

White Paper:Total Cost of OwnershipIn this whitepaper, we argue that traditional models for estimating HCIT costs are inadequate and overlook several business-critical variables. Our intention is not to provide a comprehensive TCO model, but to
expose and examine the operational considerations that most TCO models fail to recognize or account for.Read MorePatient EngagementPatient engagement should be an
essential component of every practice's operations. How do you ensure that you
have the pieces in place to achieve meaningful patient engagement and the right tools and technology?

5 Elements of a Successful Patient Engagement Strategy will explore essential tips to actively involve patients in their health care experience, provide better health
outcomes and incur lower practice costs.
Read MoreMobile DevicesMobile health--using smartphones and other mobile devices in the health care setting--will be a significant factor as we move toward patient-centered care and value-based reimbursement. Mobile health promises to enhance care and improve efficiency.Read MoreMaking the SwitchThis whitepaper serves as a guide to
identifying an under-performing EHR and replacing it with a solution
that delivers results. It offers answers to a number of common
questions about EHR adoption and replacement and demonstrates
how the right EHR can help practices get more money and more
control, freeing up physicians to focus on patient care.Read MoreThe New Role of the CFONo one is expecting the CFO to actually take on the jobs of chief
medical officer, chief technology officer, chief marketing officer, and
head of strategy. However, simply overseeing the financial picture is
no longer enough. CFOs must strengthen their skills in these varying
areas and then build upon them by hiring the right talent to round out
the capabilities of the CFO office.Read MoreOptimizing  Practice Growth: 7 Proven Strategies  for SuccessThe pressure exerted on practices to grow, often through integration with additional practices or with larger health care systems, has been strong for years, and the trend shows no signs of abating.

 Read MoreSucceeding as  an ACO: A 6-Step  Guide for Health  Care OrganizationsThe number of ACOs has risen dramatically in recent years. Some research supports the effectiveness of the ACO model in improving the cost and efficiency of care without sacrificing quality. However, there are important concerns about ACOs, such as questions about whether ACOs are equipped to transform physician behaviors on the scale that will be needed, an ongoing disagreement about clinical quality standards, and concerns about whether that patient participation is voluntary.Read MoreWinning At Risk:  A Medicare Shared Savings PlaybookAccountable care organizations (ACOs) present a significant opportunity to reduce health care expenditures and ensure quality care. Based on our work with clients who have seen success and shared in savings through the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), we offer a step-by-step "playbook" for this popular program.Read More5 Essentials  for Surviving  and Thriving as  an Independent  PracticeIt is harder than ever to run a successful independent medical practice. As value-based reimbursement becomes more common alongside the fee-for-service model, physicians will be on the hook for demonstrating clinical outcomes and providing seamless care coordination in order to receive payment.Read MoreSucceeding as an ACOThe number of ACOs has risen dramatically in recent years.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
