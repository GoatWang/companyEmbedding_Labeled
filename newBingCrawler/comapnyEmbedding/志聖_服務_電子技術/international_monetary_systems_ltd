A Common Cause for Sustainable Growth and Stability in Central Africa

Six countries in Central Africa are in dire economic and financial shape, and have a common strategy to turn their economies around with help from the IMF.





For Japan's Economy, Now Is the Time to Step Up Reforms

Japan’s economy is expected to grow again this year—at 1.3 percent—thanks to a continued pickup in trade and temporary fiscal support. But a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce mean that the country will need to speed up reforms to boost wages, productivity, and growth, said the IMF in its annual review of the Japanese economy.





Rotating Global Imbalances

The IMF just released its latest assessments of external positions for the 29 largest economies. Global current account imbalances have rotated towards advanced economies, posing new risks and policy challenges for deficit and surplus countries alike. In a blog, IMF economists explain what this means and what can be done.





Stepping up the Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing

Many governments have ramped up efforts to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing. In a blog, IMF chief Christine Lagarde highlights three areas where more work is needed to combat corruption and explains how the IMF can help its members through new tools and smart policy.

Euro Area: There Is Recovery, But Reforms Are Needed

Euro area recovery has strengthened over the last year, bringing with it more jobs and opportunities. But even as the zone's economy gathers momentum, it still faces the hurdles of high public debt in some states, a lack of convergence in income levels among countries, and the need to reduce imbalances that built up before the crisis.

International Monetary Systems, Ltd. Files to Deregister


Press Release
-

												Jul 1, 2016						
 


			New Berlin, WI, 
			July 1, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	International Monetary Systems, Ltd. (the “Company”) filed a Form 15 today, July 1, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to voluntarily deregister its common stock. The Company is eligible to deregister because it has fewer than 500 holders of record of its common stock and total assets of less than $10 million at the end of each of the last 3 years. In filing the Form 15, the Company’s obligations to file certain reports and forms with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, are immediately suspended. The Company expects that deregistration of its common stock will become effective within 90 days.
The Company is deregistering because it believes that the incremental cost of compliance and other public company reporting requirements does not provide a discernible benefit to the Company and is not in the best interests of its shareholders. Factors influencing the Board of Director’s decision include the following:
• the high accounting, legal and administrative costs of preparing and filing periodic reports and other filings with the SEC in comparison to the size of the Company;
•  the amount of time senior management of the Company is required to devote to matters related to its securities as opposed to time concentrating on the business of the Company;
• the already limited trading volume and liquidity in the Company’s common stock; and
• the fact that the lack of liquidity of the common stock makes it unlikely that the Company can effectively use its common stock to compensate employees, raise capital or make acquisitions.
The Company's stock will continue to be traded on the OTC Pink Sheets market.
