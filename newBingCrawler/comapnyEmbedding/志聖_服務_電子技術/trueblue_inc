TrueBlue Stock Sees Short Interest Drop 42.3%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 07/29/2016 settlement date, which shows a 428,056 share decrease in total short interest for TrueBlue Inc , to 584,671, a decrease of 42.27% since 07/15/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.
