  maintenance
      n 1: activity involved in maintaining something in good working
           order; "he wrote the manual on car care" [syn: {care},

      5: the unauthorized interference in a legal action by a person
         having no interest in it (as by helping one party with money

         [syn: {maintenance}, {criminal maintenance}]

來源(8): Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856) [bouvier]
  MAINTENANCE, quasi contracts. The support which one person, who is bound by 
  law to do so, gives to another for his living; for example, a father is 
  bound to find maintenance for his children; and a child is required by law 
  to maintain his father or mother when they cannot support themselves, and he 
  has ability to maintain them. 1 Bouv. Inst. n. 284-6. 
  
  

來源(9): Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856) [bouvier]
  MAINTENANCE, crimes. A malicious, or at least, officious interference in a 
  suit in which the offender has no interest, to assist one of the parties to 
  it against the other, with money or advice to prosecute or defend the 
  action, without any authority of law. 1 Russ. Cr. 176. 
       2. But there are many acts in the nature of maintenance, which become 
  justifiable from the circumstances under which they are done. They may be 
  justified, 1. Because the party has an interest in the thing in variance; as 
  when he has a bare contingency in the lands in question, which possibly may 
  never come in esse. Bac. Ab. h.t. 2. Because the party is of kindred or 
  affinity, as father, son, or heir apparent, or husband or wife. 3. Because 
  the relation of landlord and tenant or master and servant subsists between 
  the party to the suit and the person who assists him. 4. Because the money 
  is given out of charity. 1 Bailey, S. C. Rep. 401. 5. Because the person 
  assisting the party to the suit is an attorney or counsellor: the assistance 
  to be rendered must, however, be strictly professional, for a lawyer is not 
  more justified in giving his client money than another man. 1 Russ. Cr. 179. 
  Bac. Ab Maintenance: Bro. Maintenance. This offence is punishable by fine 
  and imprisonment. 4 Black Com. 124; 2 Swift's Dig. 328; Bac. Ab. h.t. Vide 3 
  Hawks, 86; 1 Greenl. 292; 11 Mass. 553, 6 Mass. 421; 5 Pick. 359; 5 Monr. 
  413; 6 Cowen, 431; 4 Wend. 806; 14 John. R. 124; 3 Cowen, 647; 3 John. Ch. 
  R. 508 7 D. & R. 846; 5 B. & C. 188.

Software maintenance in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes.[1]
A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects. However, one study indicated that over 80% of maintenance effort is used for non-corrective actions.[2] This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system.[citation needed] More recent studies put the bug-fixing proportion closer to 21%.[3]

History[edit]
Software maintenance and evolution of systems was first addressed by Meir M. Lehman in 1969. Over a period of twenty years, his research led to the formulation of Lehman's Laws (Lehman 1997). Key findings of his research include that maintenance is really evolutionary development and that maintenance decisions are aided by understanding what happens to systems (and software) over time. Lehman demonstrated that systems continue to evolve over time. As they evolve, they grow more complex unless some action such as code refactoring is taken to reduce the complexity.
In the late 1970s, a famous and widely cited survey study by Lientz and Swanson, exposed the very high fraction of life-cycle costs that were being expended on maintenance. They categorized maintenance activities into four classes:

Adaptive – modifying the system to cope with changes in the software environment (DBMS, OS) [4]
Perfective – implementing new or changed user requirements which concern functional enhancements to the software
Corrective – diagnosing and fixing errors, possibly ones found by users [4]
Preventive – increasing software maintainability or reliability to prevent problems in the future [4]

The survey showed that around 75% of the maintenance effort was on the first two types, and error correction consumed about 21%. Many subsequent studies suggest a similar magnitude of the problem. Studies show that contribution of end user is crucial during the new requirement data gathering and analysis. And this is the main cause of any problem during software evolution and maintenance. So software maintenance is important because it consumes a large part of the overall lifecycle costs and also the inability to change software quickly and reliably means that business opportunities are lost. [5] [6] [7]
Importance of software maintenance[edit]
The key software maintenance issues are both managerial and technical. Key management issues are: alignment with customer priorities, staffing, which organization does maintenance, estimating costs. Key technical issues are: limited understanding, impact analysis, testing, maintainability measurement.
Software maintenance is a very broad activity that includes error correction, enhancements of capabilities, deletion of obsolete capabilities, and optimization. Because change is inevitable, mechanisms must be developed for evaluation, controlling and making modifications.
So any work done to change the software after it is in operation is considered to be maintenance work. The purpose is to preserve the value of software over the time. The value can be enhanced by expanding the customer base, meeting additional requirements, becoming easier to use, more efficient and employing newer technology. Maintenance may span for 20 years, whereas development may be 1-2 years.[citation needed]
Software maintenance planning[edit]
An integral part of software is the maintenance one, which requires an accurate maintenance plan to be prepared during the software development. It should specify how users will request modifications or report problems. The budget should include resource and cost estimates. A new decision should be addressed for the developing of every new system feature and its quality objectives. The software maintenance, which can last for 5–6 years (or even decades) after the development process, calls for an effective plan which can address the scope of software maintenance, the tailoring of the post delivery/deployment process, the designation of who will provide maintenance, and an estimate of the life-cycle costs. The selection of proper enforcement of standards is the challenging task right from early stage of software engineering which has not got definite importance by the concerned stakeholders.
Software maintenance processes[edit]

The implementation process contains software preparation and transition activities, such as the conception and creation of the maintenance plan; the preparation for handling problems identified during development; and the follow-up on product configuration management.
The problem and modification analysis process, which is executed once the application has become the responsibility of the maintenance group. The maintenance programmer must analyze each request, confirm it (by reproducing the situation) and check its validity, investigate it and propose a solution, document the request and the solution proposal, and finally, obtain all the required authorizations to apply the modifications.
The process considering the implementation of the modification itself.
The process acceptance of the modification, by confirming the modified work with the individual who submitted the request in order to make sure the modification provided a solution.
The migration process (platform migration, for example) is exceptional, and is not part of daily maintenance tasks. If the software must be ported to another platform without any change in functionality, this process will be used and a maintenance project team is likely to be assigned to this task.
Finally, the last maintenance process, also an event which does not occur on a daily basis, is the retirement of a piece of software.

There are a number of processes, activities and practices that are unique to maintainers, for example:

Transition: a controlled and coordinated sequence of activities during which a system is transferred progressively from the developer to the maintainer;
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and specialized (domain-specific) maintenance contracts negotiated by maintainers;
Modification Request and Problem Report Help Desk: a problem-handling process used by maintainers to prioritize, documents and route the requests they receive;

Categories of maintenance in ISO/IEC 14764[edit]
E.B. Swanson initially identified three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective.[8] These have since been updated and ISO/IEC 14764 presents:

Corrective maintenance: Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems.
Adaptive maintenance: Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment.
Perfective maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability.
Preventive maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

There is also a notion of pre-delivery/pre-release maintenance which is all the good things you do to lower the total cost of ownership of the software. Things like compliance with coding standards that includes software maintainability goals. The management of coupling and cohesion of the software. The attainment of software supportability goals (SAE JA1004, JA1005 and JA1006 for example). Note also that some academic institutions[who?] are carrying out research to quantify the cost to ongoing software maintenance due to the lack of resources such as design documents and system/software comprehension training and resources (multiply costs by approx. 1.5-2.0 where there is no design data available).

Not only are error-prone modules troublesome, but many other factors can degrade performance too. For example, very complex “spaghetti code” is quite difficult to maintain safely. A very common situation which often degrades performance is lack of suitable maintenance tools, such as defect tracking software, change management software, and test library software. Below describe some of the factors and the range of impact on software maintenance.

    Skilled Group swallowed by rival Programmed Maintenance after 21 years on ASX

Programmed Maintenance managing director Chris Sutherland predicts a wave of outsourcing of labour by Australian companies in a lower-growth economy. And, as an enlarged company with annual revenues of $3.4 billion following a buyout of rival Skilled Group, Programmed is better positioned to snare a large chunk of that work.Mr Sutherland will run the merged entity from his Perth headquarters even though Skilled shareholders will end up holding 52.4 per cent of the group after the Skilled board agreed to a sweetened buyout offer which values Skilled shares at $1.79 each, five months after rejecting original overtures.

The merged entity will have a market capitalisation of more than $750 million and will likely make its way into the S&P/ASX 200 index, which should provide an added boost to its share price. Programmed has 10,000 direct employees while Skilled employs more than 50,000 people a year under labour hire agreements. Mr Sutherland said the merger made sense at a time when Australian companies are looking to trim costs and seeking partnerships with strong local labour hire entities with a robust balance sheet."Clearly there are businesses out there looking at their own cost structures," he told Fairfax Media. The merger was officially announced on Wednesday morning after both companies went into a trading halt on Monday.Geographical spread
Programmed derives 37 per cent of its revenues from its home state of Western Australia and the merger will help spread the geographic and industry risk as the mining, and oil and gas sectors suffer a serious capital investment strike.

The combined entity will generate 41 per cent of total revenues from mining, and oil and gas, and 22 per cent from government and infrastructure contracts. Mr Sutherland predicts there will be more mergers in the labour hire industry, in part because of the rising costs of information technology spending to run labour hire firms efficiently.But he will focus on integrating the two firms and pulling out $20 million in synergies in the first 12 months and $35 million over three years. Programmed will stay out of the next wave of mergers. "I think I've got more than enough on my plate," he says.

Skilled chief executive Angus McKay, who has been at the helm since January this year, said the better deal that Skilled was able to negotiate after rejecting the first offer was a good result for its shareholders, and he is pragmatic about leaving after such a short time. "I'm the one that got the holiday. The job here is not about job protection," he told Fairfax Media. Mr McKay, 50, is a former chief financial officer of beer maker Foster's Group.Skilled, which was known as Skilled Engineering when it first listed on the ASX in 1994, was set up by Frank Hargrave in 1964. He was a self-employed electrician, and a pioneer in outsourcing the services of skilled tradesmen. His mantra in those early days was to keep "your head down and your arse up", a comment he repeated in 2004 in an interview with Fairfax Media when he stepped down to let his son Greg become the chief executive.Skilled shareholders will receive 0.55 Programmed shares plus 25¢ in cash. The deal values the business Skilled at around $422 million, with Programmed's market capitalisation at $332 million prior to a trading halt on Monday. The share prices of both companies increased on Wednesday when they emerged from the halt. The first offer from Programmed was pitched at 0.5032 Programmed shares and 25¢ for each Skilled share.The deal, which is being done via a scheme of arrangement, ends 21 years of Skilled Group being a separately listed company on the ASX.
Clearly there are businesses out there looking at their own cost structures.

 Chris Sutherland, Programmed Maintenance


Skilled has been able to demand a better deal after originally sending Programmed packing in January this year after it first came knocking with merger overtures in December last year. That original offer by Programmed was pitched at 0.5032 Programmed shares and 25¢ for each Skilled share.Regulars on the BRW Rich 200 List
It's been a wild ride for Skilled. Its own ups and downs have many similarities with the broader Australian economy as the demand for contract labour now shrinks in resources. Frank Hargrave, who handed over the reigns as chief executive to son Greg in 2004, always had a pragmatic approach befitting his early days as a sparky."In those first few years, you just kept your head down and your arse up," Frank Hargrave told The Age in an interview in 2004 when he retired from the business."I started out as a 24-year-old kid with just 100 quid in the bank," he said at the time.The Hargrave family were regulars on the BRW Rich 200 list and depending on the Skilled share price, their fortune was as high as $544 million just a few years ago. It had been trimmed to an estimated $340 million last year.
