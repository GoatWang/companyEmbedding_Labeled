Aramex PJSC: carving a competitive advantage in the global logistics and express transportation service industry

            Balakrishnan, Melodena Stephens
        

            Subject area– Entrepreneurship, International Business, Strategy. Study level/applicability– Post-graduates, Practitioners. Case overview– This case chronicles the Aramex PJSC story of entrepreneur Fadi Gandhour. The case looks at the new start-up, its growth and financing plans for expansion and how it got a competitive advantage in an industry dominated by big players. Aramex, as of 2012, was the only Arab company to have successfully listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. After 30 years at the helm of the company, Fadi Ghandour, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), was stepping down and was being succeeded by regional head, Hussein Hachem, the CEO of Middle East and Africa. Aramex had a competitive edge in emerging markets, and Fadi and Hussein knew that the route to sustainable growth was to capitalize on this opportunity using organic growth, acquisitions and strategic alliances. Expected learning outcomes– Strategy included looking at gaining a competitive advantage in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and other emerging markets. Lessons are provided on capitalization of opportunity, funding and creating an organization culture that is sustainable and reflects the Founder’s ideal. Supplementary materials– Teaching notes are available for educators only. Please contact your library to gain login details or email support@emeraldinsight.com to request teaching notes.

Aramex PJSC: carving a competitiveadvantage in the global logistics andexpress transportation service industryMelodena Stephens BalakrishnanMelodena StephensBalakrishnan is anAssociate Professorbased at the University ofWollongong in Dubai,Dubai, United ArabEmirates.Fadi Ghandour, the founder and chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) of Aramex, announced at the2012 Aramex Annual Conference that that he was stepping down as the CEO. While thistook the community by surprise, it presented new growth opportunities for Aramex. After 30years at the helm, Fadi was to be succeeded by regional head, Hussein Hachem, the CEOof Middle East (ME) and Africa, who joined the company in 1991. Fadi would remain as ViceChairman, focusing on “strategic expansions, new investments and sustainability”. ForAramex to build on its business success in the ME, it needed to identify new markets, newproducts and expand its community activities to more countries. For Fadi, remaining closeto the community and creating an intrapreneurial culture was a key requirement (Exhibit 1).He had always been passionate about being engaged in social activism and was lookingfor ways to channel corporate activism. He believed strongly that the private sector had arole to play in the development of civil societies. As Fadi and Hussein discussed the wayforward, they realized there were many hidden opportunities in a world struggling withrecession and the increasing competition in the ME region. The mission for Aramex was tobe recognized as one of the top ﬁve global logistics and express transportation serviceproviders. They had a competitive edge in emerging markets, and they knew the route tosustainable growth was to capitalize on this opportunity using organic growth, acquisitionsand strategic alliances.1. Aramex: looking back – lessons for an entrepreneur1.1 The start-up of life and the start-up of a business are, in many ways, one and thesame-Fadi GhandourFadi Ghandour was born in 1959 in a family of entrepreneurs and activists who were alwaysbreaking conventional molds. His father, Ali Ghandour, was the founder of Royal Jordanianairline. Sentenced to death in Lebanon in 1962, Ali came to Jordan as a political refugeewhen Fadi was 4 years old. His grandfather had migrated from south Lebanon to Beirut andworked from the age of 15 in various jobs, retiring as a train driver. The family had strongpolitical views, a sense of empowerment and social commitment. Fadi’s grandmothertaught herself to read and drive at the age of 55 because she wanted to be independent.Fadi had four sisters, and his father believed in gender equality and instilled that in all hischildren from an early age. While Fadi believed that entrepreneurs are not necessarily aproduct of their environment, he realized there were beneﬁts of growing up in a volatileregion ripe with conﬂict. He felt that because he understood this region and the volatility, hewas able to succeed where few companies wanted to operate by being able to neutralizethe risks of doing business in these markets.When Fadi graduated from high school, he went to George Washington University inWashington, DC to major in political science. His loving, supporting family was far off.The author would like toacknowledge the Academy ofInternational Business –Middle East North AfricaChapter for their generosity ingiving the cases to theEmerald Emerging MarketCase Studies (EEMCS)collection.Disclaimer.

About
Who We Are

Aramex has rapidly grown into a global brand, recognized for its customized services and innovative products. Listed on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and based in the UAE, Aramex is centrally located at the crossroads between East and West, which allows us to provide customized logistics solutions anywhere in the world effectively and reach more businesses and consumers regionally and globally.

We are committed to continually enhancing our operations across the region while pursuing opportunities for business growth in emerging markets abroad. This approach is core to the sustainable development of our business and commitment to facilitating wider, global trade
in an ever-changing world.


What We Do

We have successfully introduced market leading express delivery and logistics services to the
Middle East and other emerging economies. As a leading global provider of comprehensive
logistics and transportation solutions, our breadth of services include express courierdelivery,
freight forwarding, logistics, supply chain management, e-commerce and record management
services.
How We Do It
Our unique, asset-light business model underlies all of the strategic decisions we make. It has
proved highly successful, allowing Aramexus to swiftly adapt to challenging market conditions,
execute last-mile delivery solutions and quickly respond to changing customer preferences.
Innovation in technology is critical to maintaining our asset-light business model and leveraging
the Aramex global network. Instead of investing heavily in infrastructure, we acquire or partner
with domestic-focused logistics companies that have strong local networks, knowledge and
transportation solutions already in place for efficient and effective last-mile delivery. This
approach has proven to have significant benefits for both our business and customers and why
we consider ourselves a technology enterprise, selling transportation and logistics solutions
without being encumbered by heavy investments in assets. We also believe that investing in and
sourcing new technologies in the field of e-commerce in particular is core to a swifter, more
efficient movement of goods and services globally and maintaining our market leadership
position.
We also recognize that to continue to grow a truly sustainable business we must serve and
develop the markets and communities where we operate. Our “Delivering Good” sustainability
platform is active in over 180 educational, social and environmental projects worldwide and we
have partnered with a number of international and local organizations devoted to similar causes.
We are proud of the close ties we have with the communities where we operate and the
contributions we have made to their sustainable economic development.

The Aramex Future 

Our business initiatives are always informed by our larger vision of supporting greater trade in
and between emerging markets. We believe our future growth will be based on thinking and
acting differently, on embracing change as our customers and markets change. 
We live in an era where technology transforms and influences our daily lives more than ever
before. Increasingly,consumers rely on digital connectivity, using it to enhance their lifestyles.
This in turn presents opportunities for us to serve them better.


We have actively developed a culture where innovation can thrive. We will continue to invest in
our people, technology and infrastructure, and also to implement innovative solutions to satisfy
our customers’ evolving needs, while still delivering maximum value to our stakeholders and
maintaining our partnerships with local communities.

                        Leveraging partnerships will be key to business success in 2017
                    






09 Jan 2017
Interview with Hussein Hachem, Aramex CEO


                           2016 will go down as one of the most unprecedented years in history. From the UK’s decision to leave the EU, to the Presidential election in the United States, there were historic political and economic upsets that caught many by surprise. Global markets and stock exchanges are still struggling to cope, and as we enter the New Year, it is clear that 2017 will also be challenging.
The one thing that has remained relatively constant in the midst of these unpredictable times is consumer demand. While the world goes through fundamental changes, the need for the efficient and effective movement of goods and services has not changed. At Aramex our focus has been to stay alert, responsive and agile to meet these demands, and we have succeeded.
Why have we been able to navigate these turbulent times?
Innovation in technology. This has been the underlying reason why we have been able to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. In 2016 we launched our mobile app for consumers to improve our customers’ experience, giving them the option to live track their package, make in-app payments and schedule deliveries. We also partnered with what3words, the global address system, to reach more customers in off-the-grid locations. Technology is ultimately behind every fundamental business decision we make and is critical to the growth of our e-commerce business and global footprint. Other companies have also leveraged technology to succeed, with Uber, Air BnB and UAE company Careem using platforms to aggregate data, predict consumer behaviour and develop new and innovative products and services.
And while we can celebrate these achievements, the harsh reality is that technological innovation is now essential. If you are a business and want to compete, having innovative technologies is no longer an option, it is a requirement. But as we move into an unpredictable 2017, I believe the recipe for business success calls for a different order. Innovation in technology alone will no longer be enough to navigate the current environment - businesses must do more.
In my opinion, businesses must pursue strategic partnerships while continuing to leverage innovative technologies. We partnered with Australia Post this year to give us reach across all post offices worldwide. Partnerships are important because they give companies unique opportunities to further leverage their technologies, such as long-term personal relationships with new business partners, local market insights, expanded product and service portfolios and even future business deals. We aren’t the only company to have taken this idea on board. Careem recently partnered with the Roads and Transport Authority and Deliveroo to allow customers to book RTA cars and order food through their app.
Ironically, technology has always played an important role in enabling communication, as we wouldn’t often be able to connect with other companies without it. Yet in today’s environment, pursuing synergistic partnerships also allows businesses to leverage technology more effectively. Today, Aramex exports our technologies to new business partners and integrates other business’ platforms into our operations. New partnerships also make us more cost effective by outsourcing logistics services to third party suppliers who have the appropriate technologies in place. Our e-commerce platform has also benefitted from more partnerships with online shopping vendors who have the necessary technological hardware.
With all of this in mind, one thing remains very clear. Companies are succeeding by disrupting their business models through innovation in technology. But moving forward the key to more success in 2017 will be how companies leverage strategic partnerships to help them adapt to global market uncertainty, take advantage of innovative technologies and capitalize on opportunities for growth.

                    Warehousing is an integral part of our business and wider supply chain. We, at Aramex, therefore decided to propose a separate state-of-the-art facility for Dangerous Goods (HazMat) storage in Dubai South free zone area - not only to ensure the health and safety of our people, but also due to the high volume of demand to further enhance our storage capacity.
