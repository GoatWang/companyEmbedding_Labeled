Dyson Demo Flagship Omotesando






Shopfront. Screen images appealing to outside and Dyson cleaner bollards at entrance as eyecatch. 

Overview
Opened as the very 1st Dyson flagship store in the world. Retail store directly run by Dyson. Objective to offer customers to experience Dyson's perspective of the world and their new technologies. Equiped for pre-launch product display, its technology introduction and in-person experience as well.
Issues/Themes
Our challenge was, corresponded to the branded store design provided by Dyson headquarters (located in the UK), to select the locally-compliant materials and fabrication methods as the local architect and realize the store with high designability as retained their brand image.
Space Solution/Realization
Materials were picked out not only within Japan but also from all over the world. The locally-compliant treatments, processing and manufacturing methods were studied and reviewed to achieve the Headquarters' design image. Throughout the intensive meetings with the HQ's assigned designers and technical engineers, the store was built up as an eligible one as Dyson brand "outputter".

We can design and customize robots according to customers needs : height(750x1200 mm), numbers of joint, movable parts, movable range, type of sensors, number of sensors and so on.  We guarantee a complete service from planning to conception. The robot would be monitored and controlled by engineers.  A regular maintenance is also offered after conception.We also provide a stylish exterior design depending on your idea.This project is mainly for Museum of Science/ Halls. Please ask the details by e-mail or tel.An extra work will enable to have a remote control system that informs automatically an abnormality of the robot to engineers through mobile phone's e-mail. The robot can be controlled by sending the command (reset/ emergency shutdown) by e-mail.The system will be lauched soon.
