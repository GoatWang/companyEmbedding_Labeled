Ctrip.com International Ltd (ADR) Continues Strong Growth, Expands Margins
Revenue for the online travel agency jumped 46%.

Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:CTRP) showed robust growth across all of its lines in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday and showed impressive leverage. The stock was down 3% at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Concerns about slowing growth at China's leading online travel agency (OTA) make sense given the company's torrid past rates. But two things should stand out from the report: Ctrip continues to grab market share, and this is increasingly becoming a winner-takes-all field, as growing margins show the company's operational leverage.

Ctrip earnings: The raw numbers
While I'll dive into the details below, here are the headline numbers from the company's release:



Metric

Q1 2016

Q1 2017

Year-Over-Year Growth





Revenue


$605 million


$884 million


46%




Gross profit


$442 million


$707 million


60%




Operating profit*


$1.1 million


$136 million


11,600%




Data source: Ctrip.com. *Operating profit presented on non-GAAP basis.
Heading into the quarter, management had expected revenue to jump between 40% and 45%; results came in ahead of expectations. The recent addition of the Skyscanner businesses added meaningfully to results as well.
More importantly, gross profit expanded 763 basis points to 80.44%. This means Ctrip is spending less on its inventory of air, bus, train, and hotel accommodations. Three years ago, this would have been unthinkable, as the industry was caught in a race to the bottom on price.
Since the effective merger with rival Qunar, though, that has all changed. Ctrip is now the de facto OTA in China, and that gives the company leverage over airlines and hotels -- instead of the other way around.
Operating profit margins -- after backing out share-based compensation -- also expanded meaningfully: 1,525 basis points to 15.37%. Last year was full of costs associated with integrating Qunar and Ctrip. This year, those are in place, and it showed as non-GAAP operating expenses jumped just 31% against the backdrop of a 46% increase in revenue.
Digging deeper 
Ctrip has four main segments that report. As you can see, the first two make up the lion's share of sales. But all four continued to show strong growth.



Segment

Sales

Year-Over-Year Growth





Transportation


$418 million


48%




Accommodations


$301 million


28%




Packaged tours


$102 million


26%




Corporate travel


$21 million


25%




Data source: Ctrip.com. 
Accommodations grew mostly through increased organic volume. Transportation was juiced both from strong growth in the core of air travel, additions from Skyscanner, and the small but booming base of business emerging out of bus and train tickets in China.
Perhaps some of the reason for the market's tepid reaction has to do with skepticism of the company's ability to grow organically. But these same concerns surfaced after the addition of Qunar, and the increase in profitability more than made up for top-line growth concerns.





What management had to say
Founder and Chairman James Liang made it clear that the company will continue to focus not only on travel within China, but outside of it as well:

By leveraging Skyscanner and other strategic overseas investments, we expect to further strengthen our international product offerings and improve user experiences for both Chinese and international travelers. 

CEO Jane Jie Sun said Ctrip has "also been making great strides in penetrating into lower-tier cities." That, combined with the aforementioned push for international travels out of China, appears to be the company's focus moving forward.
The good news for investors is that these investments are unlikely to cost as much as those from years past. 
Looking ahead
After factoring in this quarter's results, shares of Ctrip now trade for 80 times non-GAAP trailing earnings. For the current quarter, management is expecting revenue to continue growing between 40% and 45%.

Ctrip.com International Ltd (ADR) Expands Margins, Looks Abroad
China's largest online travel agency notched growth in all four of its key business segments.

Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:CTRP), China's largest online travel agency (OTA), announced earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016 this week, and the company saw rapid revenue growth, a strategic move toward travel outside of China, and -- most impressively -- expanding margins.

Ctrip.com results: The raw numbers
Because the company's profitability is significantly skewed due to the consolidation of Qunar, these are the results that most investors are focused on.



Metric

Q4 2016

Q4 2105

Year-Over-Year Change





Revenue


$746 million


$437 million


76%




Gross profit


$568 million


$304 million


87%




Operating profit


$30 million


$14 million


118%




Data source: Ctrip.com. 
These results came in ahead of management expectations, and show just how much leverage the company has now that the OTA industry in China has undergone massive consolidation. The company's non-GAAP operating margin increased from 10% during the fourth quarter of 2015 to 16% in the most recent quarter. The importance of that 600-basis-point expansion cannot be overstated.
Growth in product development, and sales and marketing spending actually outpaced revenue growth. But this has more to do with assuming all of the obligations associated with Qunar than actual increases in spending. Indeed, on a sequential basis, spending on these two divisions was actually down 7% and 2%, respectively, from the previous quarter.
Breaking down the numbers further
As is the company's tradition, all four of the key business segments were given more specific breakdowns.



Division

Sales

Year-over-Year Growth





Transportation


$352 million


97%




Accommodations


$266 million


56%




Packaged Tours


$67 million


33%




Corp. Travel


$26 million


29%




Data source: Ctrip.com
Here again, the company did not disappoint. The rapid growth of revenue in transportation and accommodations shows that the network effect is truly taking hold: As more people flock to Ctrip to buy tickets, vendors are incentivized to join the network. As vendors join, Chinese citizens have more reasons to use the platform. It's a virtuous cycle that helps drive results and compound gains for decades -- and keeps whatever competition is left at bay.
That was evident in both train and bus ticketing. While the revenue that these two provide pales in comparison to airline travel, these segments grew sales by 70% and 250%, respectively, over the past year.





What else happened during the quarter
In late 2016, Ctrip announced that it would be acquiring Scotland-based Skyscanner, a global metasearch engine for travel. The transition closed during the fourth quarter.
Founder and Chairman James Liang said, "Together with Skyscanner, we expect to further extend our international air ticketing services to local customers in Asia-Pacific and other markets around the world." As the Chinese middle class continues to grow, they will likely be going beyond the Middle Kingdom's borders. Skyscanner is the company's attempt to make sure that those customers don't migrate to other global OTAs when the time comes to make travel plans.
Looking ahead
Alas, the days of 70% growth can't last forever. That's to be expected when you have larger and larger hurdles to jump over. Moving forward, management sees revenue growing by 40% to 45%. Management sees margins improving to somewhere between 20% and 30% over the next three years. If margins continue to expand at that rate, there's still plenty of very healthy growth for investors.
