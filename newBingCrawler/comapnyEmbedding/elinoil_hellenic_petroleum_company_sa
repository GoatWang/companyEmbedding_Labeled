Activities[edit]
Refineries and gas stations[edit]
Hellenic Petroleum operates three refineries in Greece, in Thessaloniki, Elefsina and Aspropyrgos, which account for 57% of the refining capacity of the country (the remaining 43% belongs to Motor Oil Hellas), and one in Skopje, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the OKTA refinery, which is supplied by crude oil through pipelines from Thessaloniki and covers approximately 85% of the country's needs. Crude oil for the refineries is supplied from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Russia. The company also operates over 1400 gas stations in Greece and about 350 gas stations in Albania, Georgia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It also has a network which sells LPG, jet fuel, naval fuels and lubricants.
Petrochemicals[edit]
Being the most important company that produces petrochemicals in Greece, Hellenic Petroleum has a very significant (over 50% in most cases) share of the market. Their basic products are plastics, PVC and polypropylene, aliphatic solvents and inorganic chemicals, such as chlorine and sodium hydroxide. The petrochemicals department is a part of the Thessaloniki refinery.
Electricity[edit]
Hellenic Petroleum operates a 390 MW natural gas power station in Thessaloniki. It opened in 2005 and it is operated through a subsidiary, T-Power. The fixed investment for this plant amounted to 250 million Euros.
Oil exploration[edit]
With law 2289/95, Hellenic Petroleum holds the exclusive rights for exploration and production of hydrocarbons in 62000 km² in Greece. The company is also active abroad, in cooperation with foreign companies, in Albania and Libya.
Other[edit]
Hellenic Petroleum subsidiaries include the engineering company Asprofos and the polypropylene film production company, DIAXON, whose factory is situated in the industrial area of Komotini. The company also controls a shipping company and has 35% shares in DEPA, the Greek natural gas company, and VPI, which produces PET resin.
