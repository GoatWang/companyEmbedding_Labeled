Sun Java™ System
			Web Server 7.0 is a high performance, massively 
		      scalable and secure web server that delivers dynamic
		      and static content.  Domain virtualization,
		      configuration versatility, and robust security
		      features provide a better quality of service.
		      
		    
Features




Scalability and Performance
			      Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 is a
			      multithreaded, multiprocess application
			      that can be run in either 32-bit or
			      64-bit mode, delivering high performance
			      for dynamic and secure content and
			      superior scalability of more than
			      100,000 simultaneous connections on
			      multicore, Chip Multithreading (CMT)
			      systems.
			      
			    
Server Administration
			      The administration interface allows fine
			      control over virtual servers, quick
			      access to frequently used tasks, and
			      integrated cluster management without
			      sacrificing ease-of-use from a browser
			      based or a command-line based
			      interface. The command-line interface is
			      comprehensive, secure and scriptable and
			      can be operated remotely. The JMX-based
			      management infrastructure and N1 Service
			      Provisioning Service (SPS) allows
			      distributed deployments with real time
			      monitoring and life cycle management
			      across web server farms. Most common
			      administration tasks on processes
			      without requiring restarts.
			      
			    
Cluster Support
			      Built in cluster support allows
			      monitoring and administration of
			      clusters of Web Servers, peer-to-peer
			      in-memory Java session replication.
			      
			    
Versatile Pattern Matching
			      Full regular expression support allows
			      for versatile processing of requests
			      based upon patterns, numerous
			      environment variables, masking of
			      complex application URIs, and mass
			      hosting environments.
			      
			    
Java Web Container and Session Failover
			      A high-performance, in-process Java EE 5
			      compliant implementation of Java
			      Servlets 2.5, JavaServer Pages (JSP)
			      2.1, JavaServer Faces (JSF) 1.2, JSTL
			      (JSP Standard Tag Library) 1.2, Java Web
			      Services Developer Pack (JWSDP) 2.0 and OASIS Message
			      Security and more. Lightweight session
			      failover via in-memory, secure data
			      replication provides session persistence
			      over server restarts. Integration with
			      NetBeans 5, Java Studio Enterprise 8.1
			      and Creator Developer Tools makes it
			      easy top develop, debug and deploy your
			      Java web applications.
			      
			    
WebDAV Publishing and File Management
			      WebDAV support allows easy management
			      and publishing of content to the Web
			      Server using industry standard
			      tools. Sun Java System Web Server 7.0
			      supports native Access Control Lists
			      (ACLs) in addition to WebDAV ACLs in
			      conjunction with WebDAV.
			      
			    
HTTP Compression
			      Compressing data before it is sent to
			      user-agents enables administrators to
			      conserve bandwidth and improve the
			      performance of their site. Data can be
			      compressed by MIME type, path, client,
			      user-agent, and more.

			    
Automatic Method Correction 
			      When user-agents accidentally provide
			      URLs indicating an unsecured connection
			      to a port number configured for
			      encryption, they are automatically
			      redirected to the correct URL method for
			      that port.
			  

			     
			  


Virtual Server Support
			      Thousands of domains can be served from
			      a single Web Server process. Each
			      virtual server can have its own IP
			      address, port, document root,
			      preferences, log files, and more.
			      
			    
Content Filters
			      NSAPI Filters allow developers and
			      administrators to use application logic
			      to modify request and response and
			      response headers and payload in real
			      time.
			      
			    
Data Encryption and Security
			      Resources can be secured with advanced
			      Access Control Lists (ACLs), built-in
			      Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
			      (LDAP) with flexible schema support,
			      Secure Socket Layer (SSL) v2 & v3,
			      Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and
			      leading edge Elliptic Curve Cryptography
			      (ECC). Key sizes up to 4k can be used,
			      and self-signed certificates can be
			      easily generated. Integration with
			      Solaris 10 Cryptographic Framework
			      allows use of capabilities such as the
			      Niagara Cryptographic Framework
			      (NCP). Support for installation of
			      certificates and keys stored in JKS
			      format allows easy certificate and key
			      sharing. Dynamic updating of Certificate
			      Revocation Lists (CRLs) allows PKI
			      management to be combined with high
			      service availability requirements.
			      
			    
Protection From Common Threats
			      Built-in protection from common attacks
			      including Cross Site Scripting, distributed
			      request attacks against URIs, and excessive
			      requests from IP addresses.
			      
			    
Integrated Search Engine
			      The built-in search engine provides a
			      powerful out-of-the-box search solution
			      for common document types.
			      
			    
Integrated Reverse Proxy
			      Fully integrated Reverse Proxy User-Agent
			      allows Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 to act as
			      the HTTP end-point for third-party HTTP origin
			      servers including all popular application
			      servers.
			      
			    
FastCGI Support
			      Support for the FastCGI protocol provides an
			      efficient way to use third-party technologies
			      in an out-of-process configuration. FastCGI is
			      commonly used to execute third-party code
			      without incurring a significant performance
			      penalty.
			      
			    
Robust Migration Tool
			      The integrated migration tools make it easy to
			      migrate existing Sun Java System Web Server
			      6.x server configurations.
