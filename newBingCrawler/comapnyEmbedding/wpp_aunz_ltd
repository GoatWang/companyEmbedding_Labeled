Legal battle with Advangen:WPP Aunz Ltd (ASX: WPP) is formed with the merger of WPP Plc and STW Communications Group Limited. WPP has become the majority shareholder of STW with 61.5% holdings, and STW would be the primary vehicle for WPP in Australia and New Zealand. On the other hand, Ikon Communications Pty Ltd (Ikon), a subsidiary of the WPP has filed a legal action against Advangen International Pty Ltd. Ikon’s claim is for the amount of $939,055.65 pursuant to the Services Agreement entered into by the parties on 15th June 2015. In its claim Ikon alleges that Advangen has failed to pay certain invoices for services rendered in relation to an advertising campaign. Advangen strongly disputes that Ikon has breached the Services Agreement, failed to provide certain services at all or adequately and engaged in misleading and dishonest conduct that has caused Advangen loss and damage.

                        What has always defined Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide is its ability to build brands.The difference is that building brands today requires a keen understanding of how new communications technology, new channels, and vibrant creativity combine. This is a world where the consumer is now in control, and consumer insight is paramount, and so the quality and diversity of our people are vital. A contemporary outlook and true cultural attunement are much more important in a world where there is a new mandate for our business. That mandate is integrated communications and our response, what we call 360 Degree Brand Stewardship® , means a willingness to use the broadest array of tools and techniques to understand, develop and enhance the relationship between a consumer and a brand.We do this on both a local and a global scale. Local 360 Degree Brand Stewardship® keeps the agency fully rooted in the marketplace, attracting top local clients and the best people to work on them. This keeps our understanding of the local consumer and marketplace intimate.Global 360 Degree Brand Stewardship® is a marriage of local know-how with a worldwide network capable of articulating brands as they cross borders - vital to the growing number of multinational clients seeking to leverage their powerful brands in new markets around the world.

A quick, pre-digested, highly-compressed version of the 2014 Annual Report



Who we are





WPP is the world leader in communications services. It comprises leading companies in all these disciplines:

 Advertising
 Media Investment Management
 Data Investment Management
 Public Relations & Public Affairs
 Branding & Identity
 Healthcare Communications
 Direct, Digital, Promotion  & Relationship Marketing
 Specialist Communications

There are more than 155 companies within the Group – and each is a distinctive brand in its own right. Each has its own identity, commands its own loyalty, and is committed to its own specialist expertise. That is their individual strength. Clients seek their talent and their experience on a brand-by-brand basis. Between them, our companies work with 355  of the Fortune Global 500, all 30 of the Dow Jones 30 and 71 of the NASDAQ 100. It is also of increasing value to clients that WPP companies and their people can work together, as increasingly they do: providing a tailor-made range of integrated communications services. Nearly 830 clients are now served in three distinct disciplines. Over 530 clients  are served in four disciplines, and these clients account for over 53% of Group revenues. Group companies also work with nearly 430 clients across six or more countries. 
Collectively, almost 179,000 people (including associates) work for WPP companies,  out of over 3,000 offices in 111 countries.

Why we exist





Our mission
To develop and manage talent;to apply that talent, throughout the world,  for the benefit of clients;  to do so in partnership;  to do so with profit.
Within WPP, our clients have access to companies with all the necessary marketing and communications skills; companies with strong and distinctive cultures of their own; famous names, many of them. WPP, the parent company, complements these companies in three distinct ways.

First, it relieves them of much administrative work. Financial matters (such as planning, budgeting, reporting, control, treasury, tax, mergers, acquisitions, investor relations,  legal affairs and internal audit) are co-ordinated centrally.
Second, the parent company encourages and enables operating companies of different disciplines to work together for the benefit of clients. It also plays an across-the-Group  role in the management of talent, property, procurement, IT, knowledge sharing, practice development and sustainability.
And, finally, WPP itself can function as the 21st-century equivalent of the full-service agency. For some clients, predominantly those with a vast geographical spread and a need for a wide range of marketing services, WPP can act as a portal to provide a single point  of contact and accountability.

What we think





In praise of the long view
by Sir Martin Sorrell 
Champions of the long view are becoming harder to find. Boardrooms (in the West at least) are more likely to be inhabited by the ghosts of Lehman than John Maynard Keynes’ animal spirits. Consequently, targets are often reached not by maximising revenues, but by minimising costs – including marketing spend.
Despite the challenges, our business performed well in 2014, which was another record year for the Group. We expect the pattern for 2015 to be much the same: a bit of a slog,  but a satisfactory result at the end of it, ahead of last year. Looking further into the future, corporate minds will eventually turn to investment and growth, and marketing services will be one of the principal beneficiaries.
Throughout our three decades of existence, taking the long view has worked well for WPP and its stakeholders.
We have the right strategy to take advantage of the fundamental shifts – both technological and geographical – shaping our industry. We continue to focus on: new markets, new media, data investment management and the application of technology, and ‘horizontality’.

You May Not Know Where You’re Going Until You’ve Got There 
(Which is why The Best Brief may be The Brand)
by Jeremy Bullmore
In business, particularly in marketing, we seem to be at least as reluctant as scientists to come clean about our processes of thought.

Four strategic priorities





Our goal remains to be the world’s most admired and respected communications services advisor to global, multinational, regional and local companies. To that end, we have four core strategic priorities: 

Increase the combined geographic share of revenues from the faster-growing markets of  Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe to 40-45% of revenues. 
Increase the share of revenues of new media to 40-45% of revenues.  
Maintain the share of more measurable marketing services – such as data investment management and direct, digital and interactive – at 50% of revenues, with a focus  on the application of new technology, big data and digital.  
Advance ‘horizontality’ by ensuring our people work together for the benefit of  clients, primarily through two horizontal integrators: Global Client Leaders and Regional, Sub-Regional and Country Managers.

How we’re doing





Financial summary
2014, our twenty-ninth year, was another record one, with revenue, profitability, net sales margins and earnings per share all reaching  new highs, despite strong  currency headwinds.

2014 results
Reported billings were £46.2 billion, up almost 7% in constant currencies, driven  by a strong leadership position in net new business league tables for the third year  in a row. Revenue was up well over 4%  to £11.5 billion and up over 11% in  constant currencies.
Dividends increased by 11.7% to 38.20p, a new high. This represents a dividend pay-out ratio of 45% of headline diluted earnings per share, achieved one year earlier than the objective set after the 2013 AGM.
Headline PBIT was up over 1% to  £1.681 billion and up 8% in constant currencies. Net sales margins increased by 0.2 margin points to an industry-leading 16.7% and, on a constant currency  basis, were up 0.3 margin points, in line with target.
Reported profit before interest and  tax rose over 6% to £1.569 billion from  £1.478 billion, up over 14% in constant currencies. Headline EBITDA increased  by 0.7% to £1.910 billion, up 7.5% in constant currencies. Headline profit before tax was up well over 3% to £1.513 billion and reported profit before tax was up 12% to £1.452 billion. Diluted headline earnings per share rose by over 5% to 84.9p (an all-time high) and diluted reported earnings per share were up well over 15% to 80.5p. 
The value of the Group’s non-controlled investments rose by almost £400 million to £669 million during the year, reflecting the increasing value of our investments in content businesses, primarily VICE, and  the technology partnerships formed during the year with AppNexus and Rentrak.
With a current equity market capitalisation of approximately £20.5 billion, the total enterprise value of your Company is approximately £23.6 billion, a multiple  of 12.4 times 2014 headline EBITDA. 
Free cash flow and net debt
Free cash flow amounted to almost  £1.2 billion in 2014, over £1 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Average net debt was £3.0 billion in 2014, the same level as  in 2013, at 2014 exchange rates, and net debt at 31 December 2014 was £2.3 billion, against £2.2 billion in 2013, reflecting significant incremental net acquisition  spend of £0.3 billion and incremental share re-purchases of £0.3 billion, more than offsetting the improvements in working capital at the year end. Average net debt remained around 1.6 times headline EBITDA in 2014, at the low end of the Group’s target range of 1.5-2.0 times. 
Revenue growth
Our reported revenue growth for the year was 4.6%, and on a constant currency  basis, which excludes the impact of currency movements, revenue was up 11.3%. This difference of 6.7% reflects strong foreign currency headwinds: chiefly due to the strength of the pound sterling against the  US dollar and euro in the first nine months, to some extent offset by the weakness of  the pound sterling against the US dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Indian rupee in the final quarter. 
On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions, revenue was up 8.2%, with net sales up 3.3%. In the fourth quarter, like-for-like revenue was up almost 8%, following like-for-like growth in the third quarter  of well over 7%, due to stronger growth in the fourth quarter in North America, the UK and Western Continental Europe, offset by lower growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and  Central & Eastern Europe. Like-for-like revenue growth in the second half was therefore well over 7% compared with  well over 8% in the first. 
Geographic performance 
North America, with constant currency revenue growth of well over 10% in the final quarter and like-for-like growth of over 9%, maintained the strong growth seen in the first nine months, an improvement over the third quarter year-to-date constant currency growth of almost 10%. 
In the UK, constant currency revenue was up 16%, with like-for-like up almost 13% on a full year basis. Net sales were  up over 7% in constant currency, with like-for-like up almost 5%.
Western Continental Europe revenue grew almost 4% like-for-like (almost 5%  in the second half), compared with 0.5%  in 2013.
In Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa  & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe, revenue growth in the fourth quarter was fastest overall, as it was in quarter three, up 16% in constant currency and up over 6% like-for-like.

Sector performance
Advertising and Media Investment Management was the strongest performing sector, with constant currency revenue up almost 20% for the year and up over 16% like-for-like. Net sales were up almost 8% in constant currencies and up 5% like-for-like. 
Data Investment Management revenue grew by 1.5% in constant currency, with like-for-like revenue up 0.6%, and the second half weaker than the first, partly  due to stronger comparatives in the second half of 2013. More significantly, net sales were stronger, up almost 1% in constant currencies and up 0.6% like-for-like, reflecting an improvement in the custom research parts of the business. 
The Group’s Public Relations & Public Affairs businesses returned to top-line growth in 2014, with full year revenue up well over 2% on both a constant currency and like-for-like basis. 
At the Group’s Branding & Identity, Healthcare and Specialist Communications businesses (including direct, digital and interactive), full-year revenue was up over 9% in constant currency and up 4% like-for-like. In the fourth quarter, constant currency revenue grew strongly at over 11% with like-for-like revenue growth of over 4%, an improvement over the third quarter. Net sales margins for the sector as a whole fell 0.7 margin points to 14.7% and by 0.6 margin points in constant currency, as parts of the Group’s direct, digital and interactive businesses in Western Continental Europe, together with Branding & Identity and Healthcare Communications slowed.
In 2014, 36% of the Group’s revenue  and net sales came from direct, digital and interactive, up over one percentage point from the previous year, with revenue growing well over 11% like-for-like.
