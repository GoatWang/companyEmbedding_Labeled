      Potential sale of assets or businesses of the Company
    

      The Company, in consideration of a number of restructuring and strategic options which may include the sale of one or more of its subsidiaries and/or their brands or businesses, wholly or partially to potential investors, as well as with the consideration to develop possible strategic partnership(s), started working to realize such options. There can be no certainty that any offer within this context will ultimately be made; and it cannot be relied that this process will lead to a definitive sale or a strategic partnership. It should be noted that this process may terminate without any results attained. In case of subsequent developments, further announcements to the public will be made in due course pursuant to the applicable legislations.
    

      A copy of this announcement will be made available on the Regulatory News segment of the London Stock Exchange.
