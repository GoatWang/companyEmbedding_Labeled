History[edit]
Aimia was incorporated on May 5, 2008 and is the successor to Aeroplan Income Fund following the completion of the reorganization of Aeroplan Income Fund from an income trust structure to a corporate structure.
On October 5, 2011, the Corporation started to conduct business under the new brand name Aimia, and on May 4, 2012, the Corporation changed its name to Aimia Inc. The registered and head office of Aimia is located at Tour Aimia, 525 Viger Avenue West, Suite 1000, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H2Z 0B2.[4]
Business Structure[edit]
Starting in January 2016 Aimia will move away from a geographical structure and towards a line of business structure. The three lines of business include Global Loyalty Solutions, headed by Shailesh Baidwan, Americas Coalitions, headed by Vince Timpano, and International Coalitions, headed by Jan-Pieter Lips.
Prior to January 2016[5] Aimia Inc. operated in three regional business segments: Canada, the United States and Asia-Pacific ("US & APAC") and Europe, Middle-East and Africa ("EMEA").

Airline frequent flyer programs face many challenges. Whether it's designing effective partner portfolios, expanding rewards beyond the travel sector, managing reward access and unit cost, optimizing program breakage, engaging non-frequent flyers, airlines continue to look for ways to increase the reach and effectiveness of their programs.

That’s where Aimia can help. Our roots in the airline industry run deep — all the way back to 1984, when we began life as Aeroplan, the frequent flyer program of Air Canada. In 2002, Aeroplan became the world’s first successful spin-off frequent flyer program. Today Aimia has evolved from that airline core into a global leader in loyalty management.
