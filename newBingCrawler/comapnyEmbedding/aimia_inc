History[edit]
Aimia was incorporated on May 5, 2008 and is the successor to Aeroplan Income Fund following the completion of the reorganization of Aeroplan Income Fund from an income trust structure to a corporate structure.
On October 5, 2011, the Corporation started to conduct business under the new brand name Aimia, and on May 4, 2012, the Corporation changed its name to Aimia Inc. The registered and head office of Aimia is located at Tour Aimia, 525 Viger Avenue West, Suite 1000, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H2Z 0B2.[4]
Business Structure[edit]
Starting in January 2016 Aimia will move away from a geographical structure and towards a line of business structure. The three lines of business include Global Loyalty Solutions, headed by Shailesh Baidwan, Americas Coalitions, headed by Vince Timpano, and International Coalitions, headed by Jan-Pieter Lips.
Prior to January 2016[5] Aimia Inc. operated in three regional business segments: Canada, the United States and Asia-Pacific ("US & APAC") and Europe, Middle-East and Africa ("EMEA").

Product Code: TC 3881"Rising need for competitive differentiation among organizations to increase their market shares is the factor expected to drive the loyalty management market between 2016 and 2021."
The loyalty management market is projected to grow from USD 1.68 billion in 2016 to USD 4.59 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 22.2% from 2016 to 2021. Major growth drivers for this market include rising need for competitive differentiation among organizations to increase their market shares, frequent shift in consumer demographics, increasing focus of loyalty programs on customer segmentations, significant rise in the use mobile technologies, and increase in the number of cardholders.

The on-demand deployment type segment of the loyalty management market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, 2016 to 2021. Several organizations across the globe are opting for on-demand (cloud-based) loyalty management solutions, owing to various advantages offered by them, which include low infrastructure costs and improved output with qualitative results. Increasing adoption of on-demand deployment type loyalty management solutions by various organizations is expected to fuel the growth of the on-demand deployment type segment of the loyalty management market during the forecast period.
The Latin America loyalty management market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, 2016 to 2021.
A weak economic scenario in the Latin American countries is compelling organizations in this region to boost their productivity and efficiency as well as retain their existing customers and acquire new ones. Moreover, growing consumption capacity of the middle class population in the Latin American region, increasing internet penetration, and growing user base are the factors fueling the need for targeted loyalty management solutions in the Latin American region. However, the North American region is estimated to account for the largest share of the loyalty management market in 2016. The growth of the North America loyalty management market can be attributed to the presence of key vendors of loyalty management solutions in the region.

PackSMART
The pack can speak volumes for the product it contains and quality you will receive, getting this right is key to success in many markets and industries. The PackSMART solution identifies winning designs, providing you with an understanding of the different aspects of your pack design from industry used KPI’s to shelf standout.


ProductSMART
Launching a new product, a new line or repackaging a product is often a big investment for any business that carries with it risks of failure. Keeping it on retailers’ listings requires consistently strong performance.  ProductSMART gives you the ability to make informed decisions to ensure the best chances of success. It will investigate and analyse many aspects of the product from price and quality perceptions to category positioning and future purchase intentions.


CampaignSMART
Media campaigns can add substantial value to a brand but not all campaigns perform equally, CampaignSMART provides you with a view of brand uplift. It will drive understanding of the brand funnel, reveal indicators of brand performance and image along with uncovering consumer behaviour triggered by the campaign.

Eye-Tracking Panel
Powered by Aimia:Lumen: just because your digital ads CAN be seen, doesn't mean that they WILL be seen. Our panel uses Aimia:Lumen's eye tracking technology to help brands understand what people actually look at - and what they ignore.

Airlines





Airline frequent flyer programs face many challenges. Whether it's designing effective partner portfolios, expanding rewards beyond the travel sector, managing reward access and unit cost, optimizing program breakage, engaging non-frequent flyers, airlines continue to look for ways to increase the reach and effectiveness of their programs.

That’s where Aimia can help. Our roots in the airline industry run deep — all the way back to 1984, when we began life as Aeroplan, the frequent flyer program of Air Canada. In 2002, Aeroplan became the world’s first successful spin-off frequent flyer program. Today Aimia has evolved from that airline core into a global leader in loyalty management.
