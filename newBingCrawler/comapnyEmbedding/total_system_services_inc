History[edit]
In 1959 TSYS started as a division of Columbus Bank and Trust (CB&T). In 1974, CB&T started processing credit cards for other banks. In 1983, TSYS became a separate publicly traded company, although majority ownership remained with CB&T and its successor, Synovus. In 1991, TSYS began development on the next generation of processing platforms. Then in 1994, TSYS launched TS2. On September 24, 1999 TSYS opened up its new Riverfront Campus in Downtown Columbus.[2] On October 25, 2007, TSYS and Synovus (holding 81% of shares at the time) announced a spin-off that was completed as of the end of 2007.[3]
In July 12, 1999, Total System Services, Inc. announced the signing of a multi-year agreement with Bancahsa, to process its Honducard-Visa credit cards, which represented a step in Total System Services' international expansion strategy to become the global processor of choice.[4]
In 2004, following merger between Bank One and Chase to form J.P. Morgan Chase, TSYS was awarded a contract to process its credit services business of 87 million cards.[5][6]
In 2008 TSYS launched n>genuity,[7] a quarterly publication designed to provide pertinent research, in-depth commentary and timely insight on the trends that impact the world of payments [8]
In 2010, TSYS announced they acquired majority stake in First National Bank of Omaha's merchant acquisition business for $150.5 million[9] , which was renamed TSYS Merchant Solutions[10]
In August 2012 TSYS announced a joint venture with Central Payments Co, one of the fastest growing ISOs in the US.[11]
In November 2012 TSYS announced its acquisition of ProPay, a Utah-based company with over 250,000 merchants.[12]
In February 2013 TSYS announced that it had agreed to purchase Netspend, a prepaid debit card provider, for $1.4 billion in cash.
In November 2013 TSYS announced TSYS Merchant Insights, a new partnership with Womply, a San Francisco-based startup, to provide revenue, social media, and reputation analysis tools to all TSYS merchants.[13]
In February 2016 TSYS announced its agreement to acquire TransFirst in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.35 billion.[14] The addition of TransFirst will make TSYS the sixth largest acquirer in the United States.[15] The acquisition closed on April 1, 2016.[16]
In February 2017, TSYS's lobbying of the GOP was credited for a bill that would remove the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's limits on overdraft fees. 10-12% of NetSpend's revenue comes from these fees.[17][18]

About Total Quality Systems, Inc. 








Total Quality Systems, Inc. (TQS) was founded in 1994 on the principles of innovative process and product improvement. We are a high technology company recognized nationally by the 2011 Small Business Administration (SBA) Tibbetts award for our innovative products and services. The annual Tibbetts Award is presented each year to a small business judged to exemplify the best in the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.
TQS’s innovations are born from the needs of the world’s most complex and demanding supply chains that supports the U.S. Air Force. TQS has experience throughout the entire supply chain from procurement, sustainment analysis and planning, to maintenance, repair and overhaul; we provide solutions that yield significant cost savings and/or avoidance to our clients.
Few companies can claim that they have helped their clients save $1 billion in sustainment dollars, especially clients in complex and demanding supply chains, but TQS can. TQS innovations have played a significant role in helping the USAF F-16 Program Office save over $300 million to date and cost avoidances of $1 billion are projected by 2030.
Our recent awards are a testament to our ability to hire skilled professionals who work together to provide effective and innovative solutions that yield best in industry results. No product has ever won the Great Maintenance Idea award at the annual Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium and Exhibition twice until TQS’s Intermittent Fault Detection and Isolation System (IFDIS) did in 2010 and 2012. Competing nationwide with other great idea submissions, IFDIS was solidly voted as the winner in each case.
