Limiting Liability and Insurance








[Attachment]


In our latest blog we look at whether the availability of insurance covering certain losses affects the validity of exclusion or limitation clauses that seek to exclude or limit liability for those losses.


        It is common for contracts to contain clauses whereby a party tries to exclude or limit its liability when something goes wrong. This can range from excluding all liability whatsoever, to excluding or limiting liability for certain types of losses- for example, indirect or consequential losses.
      

        Generally speaking, parties are free to include such clauses in their contracts, although liability for death or personal injury cannot be excluded. However, any such clause must satisfy the test of reasonableness contained in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA 1977)[1].
      

So what is reasonable?


        UCTA 1977 defines reasonableness as what is 'fair and reasonable' having regard to the circumstances known to the parties when the contract was made[2].
      

        This is not a particularly helpful definition, but luckily UCTA 1977 also provides guidelines for deciding what is reasonable[3]. These include the following factors:
      


          the relative bargaining positions of the parties; and
        

          whether a party knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent of the term.
        


        It will also be relevant to look at how the parties intended to allocate risk and whether the exclusion or limitation clause skews this.
      

Reasonableness and insurance


        Not surprisingly, the availability of insurance is a specific factor that the Courts take in account when deciding whether an exclusion or limitation clause is reasonable.
      

        For example, where a party purports to limit its liability to a specified amount, the Court will look at whether the party seeking to limit its liability to that amount has insurance to cover the liability, or could have had such insurance[4]. So where a party has indemnity insurance covering the liability well in excess of the amount it purports to limit its liability to, the limitation will probably be found to be unreasonable[5].
      

        On the flip-side, insurance will also be relevant where the other party (i.e. the party against whom the exclusion or limitation clause is being enforced) has, or could have had, insurance to cover its liability. So where the other party has insurance covering the type of loss, it is likely that the exclusion or limitation clause will be held to be reasonable. This is also the case where a party did not have such insurance, but could reasonably have obtained it if it had tried[6].
      

        By contrast, if the potential loss and damage was too wide and variable and could not be reasonably insured against, then a clause purporting to exclude or limit liability for that loss and damage is likely to be held unreasonable[7].
      

So is insurance relevant?


        The availability of insurance covering the type of loss or damage that a party seeks to exclude or limit is undoubtedly relevant. By way of summary, the availability of insurance covering that type of loss may well mean that the exclusion or limitation clause is found to be reasonable and therefore valid. Conversely, if the loss or damage is simply too wide to insure against, then the clause seeking to exclude or limit liability for that loss of damage will probably be found to be unreasonable and therefore invalid.

 Gateley Plc advises on £5.4m sale of IT services business

Posted on 06th April 2017   







National law firm Gateley Plc, has advised a subsidiary of LMS Capital Plc on the sale of its IT services business, 365 ITMS Limited.
The deal sees Coretx Holdings Plc acquiring 365 ITMS for £5.4m. LMS Capital Plc is a listed private equity investment company managed by Gresham House Asset Management, focusing predominantly on direct investment at the smaller end of the UK private equity market.
A national team led out of the firm’s Leeds office by Gateley Plc’s Corporate partner Sandip Khroud advised on the deal. The team comprised, solicitor Tamanna Keir and solicitor Sarah Lake (Corporate), solicitor Helen Webster (Employment), solicitor Jo Symes (Tax), partner Richard Morton (Banking & Finance), partner Phil Gregory and solicitor Samantha Hazell (Real Estate) and partner Michael Collins (Pensions).
Graham Bird, managing director at Gresham House Asset Management, said: “This is a great move for both LMS Capital and Coretx Holdings. 365 IT complements and expands Coretx Holdings’ IT services and product portfolio and places them in a strong position in the technology market.
“Gateley Plc worked collaboratively to provide support and ensure the legal process ran smoothly to completion.”
Sandip Khroud, partner at Gateley Plc, added: “Our Reading and London office put us in the perfect place for this deal, considering Reading and the surrounding areas are referred to as the tech capital for the UK. We are delighted to have been able to support LMS Capital and hope to work with them again.”
Coretx Holdings is an AIM-listed IT managed services provider, focused on the UK mid-market.
Gateley Plc’s Corporate team is one of the largest national teams in the UK and consistently advises on more transactions than other advisors in the market.
