    Tips

Inspired by
  better-than-expected durable orders for
  January

  (up 4.9% overall, and up 1.8% not factoring in transportation
  orders), the bulls took charge early on Thursday and maintained
  control all the way to the closing bell. The
  S&P 500

  was up 1.13% today, ending the session at 1,951.70.





  Not every name was a solid winner on Thursday, though.
  NetEase Inc (ADR)

  (NASDAQ:
  
NTES


  ),
  Vale SA (ADR)

  (NYSE:
  
VALE


  ) and
  HP Inc

  (NYSE:
  
HPQ


  ) each dipped deep into the red ink. Here's what investors need
  to know.
NetEase Inc (ADR) (NTES)
The good news is, online-gaming service provider NetEase
  managed to top revenue estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter.
  That bad news is, that was the only good news about last
  quarter's results, sending NTES down nearly 15% for the day.
In its fourth quarter of 2015, NetEase
  drove 7.9 billion yuan worth of sales

  , or
  $1.22 billion

  . That was a 128% improvement from the year-ago top line thanks
  to new business signed in the meantime, and handily topped
  estimates for a top line of 7.69 billion yuan.

Higher revenue isn't necessarily leading to higher margins,
  however. In fact, gross margins slumped from 72% in the same
  quarter a year earlier and from 58% in Q3 to only 53% last
  quarter, as the continued growth of lower-margin mobile games
  makes it tougher to make a buck in the business.
The math of the mobile gaming business was enough to prompt
  Credit Agricole to downgrade NTES from an "outperform" to an
  "underperform."
HP Inc (HPQ)
NTES wasn't the only name to deliver a mixed message on
  Thursday. HPQ - the consumer-oriented half of the company
  formerly just known as Hewlett-Packard - also passed along a
  quarterly earnings result that was glass-half-full as well as
  glass-half-empty.
In the previous quarter, HP
  earned the expected 36 cents per share

  on sales of $12.25 billion. The top line topped expectations of
  $12.17 billion. Revenue was still down more than 11% last
  quarter, though, and income per share of HPQ still fell short of
  the 41 cents per share earned in the comparable quarter from a
  year earlier.
The real driver of today's 4.4% pullback from HPQ shares,
  however, was mostly a less-than-impressive outlook for PC sales.
  The best
  HPQ CEO Dion Weisler could muster after the
  conference call

  :
"I think you have to be pragmatic. You have to continue to
  raise the bar on making sure you're in absolute cost position.
  Never stop looking at every screw, every piece of glue, every
  component you put into a product…But you can't cut your way to
  glory. You have to innovate your way to success."
While Weisler may not plan on cutting his way to glory,
  he is cutting 3,000 jobs before the end of the
  year

  , fanning the bearish flames.
Vale SA (ADR) (VALE)
Last but certainly not least (and for the third time in just a
  little over a week), Vale has earned a spot on the daily "worst
  three" list. This time though, there's a company-results-specific
  reason rather than a philosophical or presumptuous reason. That
  reason is, Vale reported miserable fourth-quarter numbers.
Last quarter, Vale SA
  lost a whopping $8.57 billion

  thanks to a combination of weak commodity prices and the
  collapse of two dams at a mine in Brazil

  which is jointly owned with peer and rival
  BHP Billiton Limited (ADR)

  (NYSE:
  
BHP


  ). The work stoppage and associated cleanup expenses have proven
  to be a much bigger burden than initially assumed.
VALE ended the day down more than 4%.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position
    in any of the aforementioned securities.
