BOULDER, Colo., Jun. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Surna, Inc. (OTCQB: SRNA), a technology company that engineers state-of-the art equipment for controlled environment agriculture ("CEA") with special expertise in cannabis cultivation, announced today the filing of two additional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). 
The two applications describe critical components of the Company's innovative hybrid growing facility, which is currently in development. These are the first patent applications Surna has submitted to the USPTO that cover its turnkey hybrid facility concept. 
Surna now has 11 patent applications with the USPTO, consisting of three patent estates. The three patent estates include three applications that cover its liquid cooling platform, six patent applications that cover its Reflector and two patent applications concerning the hybrid facility program.
The turnkey hybrid facility further enhances Surna's growing product line of technologies designed to improve efficiencies for cannabis cultivation and controlled environment agriculture ("CEA"). The building combines the most beneficial elements of indoor and greenhouse cultivation, and aims to provide the most controlled, cost effective, energy efficient, high yielding cultivation solution available. 
Most similar facilities are basic designs with minimal use of technology. Surna has leveraged its engineering expertise to develop a grow facility that is a leap forward in technology. Surna's recently filed patent applications protect preliminary designs that provide novel solutions to heating and cooling, supplemental lighting and other environmental control. 
"Our hybrid grow facility will be a highly energy efficient and state-of-the-art indoor cultivation facility. It is the most advanced turnkey building technology introduced to the cannabis market. The technology behind these patent applications will allow us to provide a differentiated product that will result in maximized yields and production at the lowest possible cost," stated Stephen Keen, Surna's Vice President of R&D.
About Surna, Inc.:
Surna, Inc. (www.surna.com) develops innovative technologies and products that monitor, control and or address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cannabis cultivation. Currently, the Company's revenue stream is based on its main product offerings – supplying industrial technology and products to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities. 
Headquartered in Boulder, CO, Surna's diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including the Company's signature water-cooled climate control platform. The Company's engineers continuously seek to create technology that solve the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process control.
Surna's goal is to provide intelligent solutions to improve the quality, the control and the overall yield and efficiency of CEA. Though its clients do, the Company neither produces nor sells cannabis.
Safe Harbor Statement
This news release contains statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to future business or financial results, new features or services, or management strategies) and other factors discussed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These statements are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties, so actual results may vary materially. You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as "may," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan" and other similar expressions. Our actual results, such as the Company's ability to finance, complete and consolidate acquisition of IP, assets and operating companies, could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors not within the control of the company such as a result of various factors, including future economic, competitive, regulatory, and market conditions. The company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Statement About Cannabis Markets
The use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law. This includes medical and recreational cannabis. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly. What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week. This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shutdowns.

BOULDER, Colorado, March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Surna Inc. (OTCQB: SRNA) reported its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.








"In 2016, we began executing growth, cost reduction and capital market initiatives that have strengthened our operations and financial position," stated Surna's President and Chief Executive Officer Trent Doucet. "As a result, fourth quarter revenue grew 20% year-over-year and 72% compared to the third quarter. Full year improvements include gross margin reaching 30% and a reduction in our operating loss of 83% compared to 2015. Additionally, our recent debt conversion and equity financing fortified our balance sheet by more than $5.5 million, enabling us to pursue our sales team expansion more aggressively.
"Both the medicinal and recreational segments of the cannabis cultivation market are growing rapidly in the US and internationally. We also have been building our presence and recently signed our sixth deal in Canada. In 2017, we anticipate rolling out our next generation equipment as well as beta test of our control and automation platform. 
"Overall, 2016 was a pivotal year for our market and for Surna specifically. We believe the positive trends are continuing in 2017, and we are very excited about our prospects," concluded Doucet. 
Recent Highlights 

Converted $3.2 million in principal and interest, or 100% of the obligations related to the 10% convertible promissory notes, in a series of transactions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through March 2017. 
Raised $2.7 million in the sale of equity in a series of closings in March 2017. 
Obtained a 6% short-term loan of approximately $500,000 in February 2017. 
Exhibited at several important cannabis trade shows including Marijuana Business Conference & Expo® in Las Vegas in November and CannaCon in Seattle in February. 
Signed a contract with Vancouver's Sante Veritas Therapeutic to design and provide equipment for the environmental control system in its first commercial cultivation facility. As announced in March 2017, Surna expects to ship product and recognize associated revenue of $835,000 in the third quarter of 2017. 
Appointed Timothy J. Keating, capital markets thought leader, as chairman of the board of directors in March 2017.

Results for Fourth Quarter: 2016 Compared to 2015

Revenue was $2.0 million, compared to $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting increased sales of climate control equipment. 
 Cost of revenue was $1.5 million. This compared to $2.0 million, which included reclassifications in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Gross margin was 23.9%, reflecting more efficient cost and supply chain management.  
Operating expenses were $845,000, compared to $725,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
     
SG&A and marketing expenses were $675,000, compared to $566,000, reflecting efforts related to the 2016 Marijuana Business Conference & Expo. 
Product development costs decreased to $78,000, compared to $174,000 as the Surna Reflector and the Hybrid Building transitioned to production.


Operating loss improved to $362,000, from $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Net loss was $886,000, compared to $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Balance Sheet Highlights 
At December 31, 2016, cash was $320,000, compared to $235,000 at September 30, 2016 and $331,000 at December 31, 2015. Deferred revenue was to $1.4 million, equivalent to the level at September 30, 2016 and up from $986,000 at December 31, 2015. 
Subsequent to quarter end, the company completed the conversion of its entire obligation related to its 10% convertible promissory notes, consisting of $3.2 million in principal and accrued interest, into approximately 19.6 million shares of newly issued common stock and cash payments of $314,000.  Also, the company raised $2.2 million, gross on March 7th and another $465,000 was raised by the end of March. 
Results for Twelve Months: 2016 Compared to 2015

Revenue was $7.6 million, compared to $7.9 million.  The December 31, 2016 backlog – sales amounts under contract but which were not yet completed and not included in revenue – was $2.6 million, up substantially from $1.4 million at December 31, 2015. 
Gross margin, which included the negative impact of the $530,000 warranty charge, increased to 30%, compared to 12%, primarily due to product mix, the elimination of low margin installation services and lower cost of goods. 
Operating loss was narrowed to $532,000, from $3.1 million. 
Net loss was $3.3 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.04 per share.

Additionally, our recent debt conversion and equity financing fortified our balance sheet by more than $5.5 million, enabling us to pursue our sales team expansion more aggressively."Both the medicinal and recreational segments of the cannabis cultivation market are growing rapidly in the US and internationally. We also have been building our presence and recently signed our sixth deal in Canada. In 2017, we anticipate rolling out our next generation equipment as well as beta test of our control and automation platform."Overall, 2016 was a pivotal year for our market and for Surna specifically.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including Surna's ability to monetize service components, Surna's support of premium prices for existing products, commercialization of research and development efforts and continued expansion of legal cannabis markets. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Surna's financial results is included in Surna's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.Read MoreStatement About Cannabis MarketsThe use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law.  This includes medical and recreational cannabis.  Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.  What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week.  This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.   Surna Marketing   Investor Relations     Jamie English   Kirsten Chapman/ Becky Herrick     Marketing Manager   LHA Investor Relations     jamie.english@surna.com   surna@lhai.com       +1-(303)-993-5271   +1-(415) 433-3777     Surna Inc.
