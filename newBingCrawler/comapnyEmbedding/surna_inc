BOULDER, Colorado, January 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Surna Inc. (OTCQB: SRNA), a technology company that engineers state-of-the-art equipment for controlled environment agriculture ("CEA") with expertise in cannabis cultivation, announced today it has secured a contract for approximately $725,000 with Las Vegas cultivator Cloud 9 Wholesale.
Under the terms of the agreement, Surna will provide their proprietary climate control technology to the cultivation facility for the single-phase project. The Cloud 9 Wholesale facility covers 30,000 square feet, which will require approximately 550 tons of cooling equipment for cultivation climate control.
"One of Surna's goals has been to bring efficiency to cultivation facilities. With recent press around the massive energy usage in the industry, we are pleased to see large cultivators such as Cloud 9 Wholesale utilizing Surna's technology to reduce their energy consumption. Our Company is happy to be leading the way in energy efficient cultivation technology and to be working with people like Cloud 9 Wholesale who understand the resulting positive impact," said Stephen Keen, CEO of Surna.
Nevada is one of 23 states that currently permit medical marijuana cultivation and consumption. In November 2016, Nevada will vote on expanding the law to include recreational cannabis cultivation and consumption.
About Surna 
Surna, Inc. (http://www.surna.com) develops innovative technologies and products that monitor, control and or address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cannabis cultivation. Currently, the Company's revenue stream is based on its main product offerings - supplying industrial technology and products to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities.
Headquartered in Boulder, CO, Surna's diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including the Company's signature water-cooled climate control platform. The Company's engineers continuously seek to create technology that solve the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process control.
Surna's goal is to provide intelligent solutions to improve the quality, the control and the overall yield and efficiency of CEA. Though its clients do, the Company neither produces nor sells cannabis.
Safe Harbor Statement 
This news release contains statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to future business or financial results, new features or services, or management strategies) and other factors discussed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These statements are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties, so actual results may vary materially. You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as "may", "should", "expect", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "intend", "plan" and other similar expressions. Our actual results, such as the Company's ability to finance, complete and consolidate acquisition of intellectual property, assets and operating companies, could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors not within the control of the Company such as a result of various factors, including future economic, competitive, regulatory, and market conditions. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Statement About Cannabis Markets 
The use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law.  This includes medical and recreational cannabis.  Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.  What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week.  This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.

BOULDER, Colo., Jun. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Surna, Inc. (OTCQB: SRNA), a technology company that engineers state-of-the art equipment for controlled environment agriculture ("CEA") with special expertise in cannabis cultivation, announced today the filing of two additional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). 
The two applications describe critical components of the Company's innovative hybrid growing facility, which is currently in development. These are the first patent applications Surna has submitted to the USPTO that cover its turnkey hybrid facility concept. 
Surna now has 11 patent applications with the USPTO, consisting of three patent estates. The three patent estates include three applications that cover its liquid cooling platform, six patent applications that cover its Reflector and two patent applications concerning the hybrid facility program.
The turnkey hybrid facility further enhances Surna's growing product line of technologies designed to improve efficiencies for cannabis cultivation and controlled environment agriculture ("CEA"). The building combines the most beneficial elements of indoor and greenhouse cultivation, and aims to provide the most controlled, cost effective, energy efficient, high yielding cultivation solution available. 
Most similar facilities are basic designs with minimal use of technology. Surna has leveraged its engineering expertise to develop a grow facility that is a leap forward in technology. Surna's recently filed patent applications protect preliminary designs that provide novel solutions to heating and cooling, supplemental lighting and other environmental control. 
"Our hybrid grow facility will be a highly energy efficient and state-of-the-art indoor cultivation facility. It is the most advanced turnkey building technology introduced to the cannabis market. The technology behind these patent applications will allow us to provide a differentiated product that will result in maximized yields and production at the lowest possible cost," stated Stephen Keen, Surna's Vice President of R&D.
About Surna, Inc.:
Surna, Inc. (www.surna.com) develops innovative technologies and products that monitor, control and or address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cannabis cultivation. Currently, the Company's revenue stream is based on its main product offerings – supplying industrial technology and products to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities. 
Headquartered in Boulder, CO, Surna's diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including the Company's signature water-cooled climate control platform. The Company's engineers continuously seek to create technology that solve the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process control.
Surna's goal is to provide intelligent solutions to improve the quality, the control and the overall yield and efficiency of CEA. Though its clients do, the Company neither produces nor sells cannabis.
Safe Harbor Statement
This news release contains statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to future business or financial results, new features or services, or management strategies) and other factors discussed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These statements are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties, so actual results may vary materially. You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as "may," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan" and other similar expressions. Our actual results, such as the Company's ability to finance, complete and consolidate acquisition of IP, assets and operating companies, could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors not within the control of the company such as a result of various factors, including future economic, competitive, regulatory, and market conditions. The company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Statement About Cannabis Markets
The use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law. This includes medical and recreational cannabis. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly. What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week. This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shutdowns.

 Surna Inc.: Why This Hyped Stock May Go All The Way Down To Zero - Surna Inc. (OTCMKTS:SRNA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Surna Inc.: Why This Hyped Stock May Go All The Way Down To ZeroJan. 7.15 | About: Surna Inc. (SRNA) Investor Protection Association Short onlySummaryWe have received numerous e-mails touting SRNA from various stock promoters.The recent financials of the company appear to be very bleak.Shares of the company are held by third parties and are ready to be dumped into the market.We have not contacted the company regarding the claims in the article.Note: This article is about a nano-cap stock (also referred to as a "penny stock"). While all investments are risky, nano-cap stocks are among the most risky. Among nano-cap stocks, the most risky stocks are those, which are subject to promotional campaigns (such as SRNA). They are also among the most illiquid stocks, usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment. Quite often, it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position. SRNA is no exception to that. SRNA is a nano-cap stock which is traded on the OTC Markets and priced well below the 1$ mark. The readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article.
Introduction
SRNA (OTCQB:SRNA) is a publicly traded company, which has experienced a sharp increase in trading activity during the last few days. In this article, we will outline the facts, which are, in our opinion, related to the sudden increase in the volume of this usually thinly traded, low volume stock.
The Promotion
During the last few days, we have received several promotional emails from various stock promoters touting the stock. Obviously, we do not consider the emails being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and trading activity to be a coincidence.
Emails received on SRNA:

The Reality: Zero Revenue, Negative Income, Bright Future?

As often happens with aggressively promoted companies, a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture. It seems that Surna Inc. is of no exception to that rule.
In our opinion, it is clear that the price of SRNA has nothing in common with the stock's true value. If we take a look at SRNA's income statement, we would see that the company's revenue has remained exactly zero during the entire year of 2013, while its net income has been negative during all of it:

Moreover, if we check the latest 10-Q form filed on 11/14/2014, we would see that the company is actually classified as a going concern (with all the attendant circumstances):

Finally, if we take a look at the 10-Q form filed on the 19th of November 2014, we will see that during the second half of 2014, the company has been issuing shares on a massive scale to different third parties, amounting to a total of just over 4 million shares. The stated reason is, for the most part, 'consulting services':

Taking into consideration the ongoing promotion and concluding from the aforementioned facts, we firmly believe that SRNA's current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at over-inflated prices, rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market. But why, you ask?

The Reason
Why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised? That is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock. The answer for this hides, of course, in the small print. Let us have a look at the disclaimer found in the promotional emails touting SRNA, which we've received:

and:

In simple, plain English: someone - may it be the promoter sending out the email message or a third party which had paid the promoter in cash for sending the message - is holding shares of SRNA and plans to get rid of them ("dump" them) in the open market. Therefore, our conclusion is that the promotional email's sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices, while the promoters (or third party) unload their shares upon them.
Conclusion
It is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article that we hold the opinion that SRNA shares are essentially worthless. We believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock. This practice is well known and is done exclusively for one reason only - so the insiders can unload ("dump") their shares (which they had previously acquired almost for free) in the free market onto unsuspecting investors, while taking advantage of the stock's inflated price. In view of that, we hold the opinion that any investor who had purchased shares of the company should consider liquidating his entire position immediately. Even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing.

Our View
"We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation" - Ivan Illich
For longs: If you are long the stock, we believe you should consider getting out immediately. It is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stock's price is likely to be temporary, as it will never repeat its previous highs. We believe SRNA has a price target of around $0.01, which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks (or months at most).
If you have already accrued losses on the stock, it may be a good idea to sell now so as to avoid additional losses. Do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs. Do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many. We believe SRNA's stock price will drop 90% or more in the following weeks. It may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now.
"A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them" - John C. Maxwell
For shorts: Bearing the aforementioned facts in mind, we believe sophisticated investors will quickly comprehend the idea that shorting SRNA may be a lucrative opportunity, as we are convinced that the potential downside for SRNA is substantial. If you are able to locate borrows, we believe shorting SRNA may prove to be profitable, as its price may prove to be highly inflated.

Full year improvements include gross margin reaching 30% and a reduction in our operating loss of 83% compared to 2015. Additionally, our recent debt conversion and equity financing fortified our balance sheet by more than $5.5 million, enabling us to pursue our sales team expansion more aggressively."Both the medicinal and recreational segments of the cannabis cultivation market are growing rapidly in the US and internationally. We also have been building our presence and recently signed our sixth deal in Canada. In 2017, we anticipate rolling out our next generation equipment as well as beta test of our control and automation platform."Overall, 2016 was a pivotal year for our market and for Surna specifically.

(www.surna.com) develops innovative technologies and products that monitor, control and or address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cannabis cultivation. Currently, the company's revenue stream is based on its main product offerings – supplying industrial technology and products to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities.Headquartered in Boulder, CO, Surna's diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including the company's signature water-cooled climate control platform. The company's engineers continuously seek to create technology that solves the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process control.Surna's goal is to provide intelligent solutions to improve the quality, the control and the overall yield and efficiency of CEA. Though its clients do, the company neither produces nor sells cannabis.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company's future business expectations, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including Surna's ability to monetize service components, Surna's support of premium prices for existing products, commercialization of research and development efforts and continued expansion of legal cannabis markets. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Surna's financial results is included in Surna's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.Read MoreStatement About Cannabis MarketsThe use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law.  This includes medical and recreational cannabis.  Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.  What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week.  This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.   Surna Marketing   Investor Relations     Jamie English   Kirsten Chapman/ Becky Herrick     Marketing Manager   LHA Investor Relations     jamie.english@surna.com   surna@lhai.com       +1-(303)-993-5271   +1-(415) 433-3777     Surna Inc.

Signs Contract with Vancouver's Sante Veritas TherapeuticPR NewswireFebruary 28, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareContract valued at $835,000 represents Surna's continued growth in CanadaBOULDER, Colo., Feb. 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Surna Inc. (SRNA), a technology company that engineers equipment for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) with special expertise in cannabis cultivation, signed a contract with Vancouver's Sante Veritas Therapeutic to design and provide equipment for the environmental control system in its first commercial cultivation facility. Surna expects to ship and recognize revenue of $835,000 in the third quarter of 2017."Cannabis for medical use is legal throughout all of Canada, making the market an outstanding opportunity for continued growth," said Surna CEO Trent Doucet. "We now have five clients in Canada, and our sales team continues to see significant activity from both new market entrants as well as existing clients planning expansion."Surna's innovative technology and products address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cultivation, enabling companies to both improve product quality and yield while significantly reducing energy and other resource consumption."At Sante Veritas, the well-being of our patients and customers will always be our first priority," said Suzanne Wood, CFO. "We selected Surna because its energy efficient environmental control system provides one of the highest levels of biosecurity and is designed to meet our goal of delivering the absolute highest quality product."About SurnaHeadquartered in Boulder, Colorado, Surna Inc. (SRNA) develops and markets novel energy and resource-efficient solutions, including the company's signature water-cooled climate control platform, which meet the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process control. Surna's solutions aim to improve the efficiency, reliability, and overall yield of controlled environment agriculture (CEA). Though many of its clients do, Surna neither produces nor sells cannabis. For more information, please visit (www.surna.com).About Sante Veritas Therapeutic Sante Veritas is an emerging North American cannabis platform company with the goal of becoming a leading integrated producer and marketer of innovative, branded cannabis products and therapies. SVT is committed to becoming a licensed producer under Canada's Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (the "ACMPR").

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including the uncertainties as to the timing of the transactions described above, uncertainties as to how many holders will agree to the terms of a transaction and the possibility that various closing conditions for the transactions may not be satisfied or waived. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Surna's financial results is included in Surna's filings with the SEC, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.Statement About Cannabis MarketsThe use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law.  This includes medical and recreational cannabis.  Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.  What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week.  This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.Read MoreContacts:Amy Leger aleger@metzgeralbee.comJamie English jamie.english@surna.comTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/surna-inc-signs-contract-with-vancouvers-sante-veritas-therapeutic-300414592.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDow hits record high while tech retreatsReutersStart Making $1,000 Every DayTorOptionSponsoredRepublicans Want Net Neutrality Input from Alphabet, Facebook, Comcast, Amazon, and MoreFortuneTop Republican senator says his party is in 'denial' about TrumpBusiness InsiderScaramucci isn’t done failingYahoo FinanceNo Bubble in Stocks But Look Out When Bonds Pop, Greenspan SaysBloombergSoftbank's Masayoshi Son takes a huge gamble: rptYahoo Finance VideoStocks rally, Apple earnings on deckYahoo FinanceThe 'case of the incredible shrinking airline seat' is finally being investigatedYahoo FinanceUnder Armour: 'We're pivoting'Yahoo FinanceFix My Finances: I'm overwhelmed by debt and don't know what to doYahoo FinanceAirlines: Being on time costs way more moneyYahoo Finance VideoApple earnings, auto sales — What you need to know in markets on TuesdayYahoo FinanceWhy a 'fiver' party should be your child's next birthday celebrationYahoo Finance CanadaTrump's approval rating just dropped to a new low in his favorite pollBusiness InsiderMysterious craters blowing out of Russia could mean trouble for the whole planetCNBCHouse conservative calls for special counsel's resignationA: I don't see any picture of Comey and Mueller hugging and kissing each other, but I have seen Trump hugging and kissing the Russian ambassador and Putin.Join the Conversation1 / 51k
