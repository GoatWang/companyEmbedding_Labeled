Weathernews with others to Develop
	Next-Generation Auto Logistics Solutions


Weathernews Inc. (head office: Chiba; president: Chihito Kusabiraki) have agreed to team with Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (head office: Tokyo; president: Yasumi Kudo), Monohakobi Technology Institute (head office: Tokyo; president: Makoto Igarashi) , NYK Business Systems Co., Ltd. (head office: Tokyo; president: Toshiaki Takeda) and Kozo Keikaku Engineering Inc. (head office: Tokyo; president: Shota Hattori) on the joint development of next-generation solutions using state-of-the-art technology in the auto logistics field.
	
 
The effort has been given the name “Symphony Project” and will aim to create new value in the auto logistics supply chain and offer next-generation solutions for our customers under the slogan ”Bringing value to customers by providing value-added services and solutions that feature unique logistics technologies.” The project will fuse NYK Group’s knowledge, on-site capabilities, and global network which NYK Group have been building up in global auto logistics business, with Weathernews’ innovative infrastructure network and its weather forecast technology, and with Kozo Keikaku Engineering’s cutting edge simulations that make use of advanced operations research techniques and data-analysis technology.
 
Through this Symphony Project focusing on development of new services for each ASEAN country whose auto logistics demand is remarkably expanding, we are first moving to offer our new "Garuda" value-added services suitable to the local logistics situations in Indonesia, which is rapidly becoming the largest car market among the ASEAN countries.
 
Examples of development solutions include the following:
 

Environmental assessments of transport and risk assessments
Systems allowing visualization of complex transport processes
Monitoring services using peculiar weather observation infrastructure
Analysis of logistics process and inventory optimizing simulation
Optimization of car's yard (seamless service that includes planning,designing, operation, and improvements)

 
Weathernews contribution to the Symphony Project will be the maximum application of the knowledge and acumen gained from many years supporting Japan’s highway and logistics markets. Starting with Indonesia, Weathernews is actively advancing weather risk communication services we provide, and expanding our innovative network of sensory infrastructure throughout Asia.

Minimize Loss Strategy with You

              Due to the excessive supply of ships in the market, the shipping industry has been exposed to a historical recession the last one to two years.

What we would like to discuss in this forum is what could be the strategy to minimize the loss by enhancing operational techniques, in order to overcome the current market environment together.

Ceremony held in celebration of launching Weathernews FranceWeathernews has positioned the Energy, Consumer Product Goods & Retail, Supply Chain and Agricultural markets as “environmental weather markets” from 2017. Weathernews acquisition of Metnext SA (Metnext); European weather company on January 16th, pave the way for deploying Weathernews France services for “environmental weather markets” globally. On February 2nd, the Weathernews France launch ceremony was held, where 25 staff members from Weathernews France, Weathernews President & Representative Director Kusabiraki, and 5 members of the project team gathered together for the event. Everyone in attendance shared a vision for the future and strengthened their bonds of trust over a glass of champagne.25 staff from Weathernews France, Weathernews President & Representative Director Kusabiraki, and 5 members of the project teamLive connecting Weathernews France in Paris, Weathernews Global Center in Japan and other offices in Europe and USASpeech from Thomas Skov, Executive Officer of Weathernews Inc.With Weathernews France capabilities a new opportunity is opening up for our customers, our staff and our supporters. We will now have a 3rd leg on our solution offering, where previously we have been focusing only on providing high level solutions Shipping and Airline companies in Europe, we now have solutions that bring tangible value to both Energy, Consumer Goods, Supply Chain, and Agriculture companies. Not only customers in France will benefit from the solutions, also Weathernews customer and organization throughout Europe will be able to service and value creation.Thomas Skov, Executive Officer of Weathernews Inc.Until now, Weathernews has provided services in Japan for the Energy, Consumer Product Goods & Retail, Supply Chain and Agriculture industries. We asked the project leader, Mitsuhiro Ogata, why these are being positioned as “environmental weather markets” now, and why services will be developed in Europe instead of Japan.- First of all, what kind of markets do “environmental weather markets” refer to?Ogata:“Environmental meteorology weather markets” are markets that are affected by the environment or have an impact on the environment. For example, with energy, everyone uses heating when it is cold and air conditioning when it is hot. This results in an increase in electricity consumption, and power companies work hard to generate power to provide this electricity. That is, changes in the weather lead to changes in how people feel, and the impact on the environment is increased due to the consumption of fuel and emission of CO2 in that process. However, electricity essentially cannot be stored. Even if the effort is made to burn fuel to generate power, if the temperature does not fall as low as expected, people will not use their heating and the surplus electricity is discarded. The same applies in factory & retail because people’s preferences and consumption changes according to changes in the weather. If stock is unsold due to misreading the weather, it must be discarded, and waste disposal sites must operate to process the discarded items, resulting in a significant impact on the environment. It is the same in agriculture.Mitsuhiro Ogata, Environmental Weather Markets Leader, Weathernews France Establishment Project Leader- Until now, Weathernews has provided services to these markets in Japan, but why are you focusing on “environmental weather markets” this time around?Ogata:There are three key points behind this decision.The first is the increase in the need to reduce the impact on the environment using the weather. One part of the backdrop to this is the “Paris Agreement” aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the end of the 21st century. In particular, Europe is moving with considerable speed to eliminate all waste. Eliminating waste could be rephrased as “not having excess inventory”. Electricity, food and crops all result in unnecessary consumption of fuel and the emission of greenhouse gases in the process of producing and disposing of excess inventory. Conversely, by understanding changes in the weather and climate and producing the optimal amount required by people, it is possible to reduce the environmental impact. There are heightened needs for the use of meteorological information because customers are directly faced with this issue particularly in “environmental weather markets”.The second key point is the relationship with “transportation weather markets”.Until now, we have supported “transportation weather markets” carrying materials using shipping, aviation, railways and road transportation. The cargo being carried by cargo ships and trucks is also “inventory in transport”. By utilizing our service know-how in transportation weather markets, we can support the overall optimization of the supply chain, including the inventory in transport of customers in environmental weather markets who are receiving transportation services.The third key point is the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as solar and wind power that is progressing globally. Needless to say, this is significantly affected by the natural environment such as sunlight and wind, and detailed weather information is required for providing stable power generation and predicting the optimal balance of supply and demand. Furthermore, in order to construct new facilities such as offshore wind power, it is necessary to determine whether it is possible to safely transport materials and conduct work. We can utilize know-how such as that on logistics support and marine construction support which we have provided inside and outside Japan in the past.- Why did you acquire the French weather company Metnext and welcome it into the Weathernews Group as Weathernews France?Ogata:In order to launch our business in environmental weather markets, we formulated a strategy of starting from Europe where these are the most developed. To achieve this, we felt it was necessary to have a partner that is well-positioned and has business sense in these markets, rather than attempt to do it alone. In this context, we were fortunate to meet Mr. Patrice, who founded Metnext, and we found that they were providing services to the energy, factory & retail, and agriculture markets in Europe that we were focusing on. Also, one of the strengths of Weathernews is communication during navigation decision-making, etc. while Metnext’s strengths are in preliminary investigations and post-project evaluation, and we felt that we could create a relationship in which we utilize each other’s strengths to compensate for our current weaknesses. In addition, another key point was that they have a geographical advantage, and will be able to promote the Weathernews Group’s creation of partnerships in Europe. Their corporate philosophy to “help all people through weather” is extremely compatible with the Weathernews corporate philosophy of “help people when it matters” and this was a deciding factor for welcoming them to the Weathernews Group as Weathernews France.- What will the schedule for service development be?Ogata:The development of services is slated to be completed in 2017 while holding discussions with symbolic customers(*) representative of the respective markets in Japan and France. We would like them to be used by more customers from 2018. The key to service development is how we communicate with symbolic customers and create services that produce value for the market as a whole. Developing and deploying new services with a new partner is challenging for Weathernews. We want to clear each issue we face with “Co-growth” as our watchword, and provide new value to customers.*Symbolic customerA customer representative of a market that has built a long-standing partnership of “co-evolving and co-creating” with the Weathernews Group.Press release about the Acquisition of Metnext SA

Our Global Mobile Content Service constantly changes the way people interact with the weather. Because the mobile phone is the world's most "personal" media device, it is only natural that the weather information provided can be tailored to suit the needs of the individual no matter when or where. For Weathernews, it's all about transforming weather information into a service which both matches the needs of the individual and exceeds their expectations.

From large commercial jetliners to helicopters, weather is a critical element which needs to be addressed at the operational level. Our SKY Service helps airlines improve their operations, including; flight planning, pilot briefings, and flight monitoring, which considers the weather risk at the time of flight plan creation. These SKY services cover passenger and cargo transportation, fire-fighting, disaster prevention, crop dusting, and aviation photography.

For over 50 years Weathernews has been the leader in providing risk communications services to the international shipping business and the marine industry. Weathernews currently supports international shipping companies from 12 countries with safe and efficient weather routing. Our track record and continued focus on developing new services ensures that Weathernews will continue to be the leading provider of weather services to the marine transportation industry along the concept of Total Fleet Management Service.

We provide companies carrying out sea- and coastal-based work projects with powerful support to ensure that work is done safely and efficiently. Our precise information targets specified sea areas and route areas, while our RC Service (Risk Communication Service: a consulting service for weather and hydrographic conditions) is tailored to each operational phase. Our coverage is not limited to the seas around Japan, but extends to worldwide areas such as the Chinese continental shelf, Southeast Asia, the North Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Sakhalin coast.

With the rapid advance in information technology, retailers can get information about the sales results for each product and the number of customers at the stores by using the sales data from POS system. Our advanced service, can be customized for customers, to help analyze the correlation between the seasonal fluctuations of the temperature and product sales. Understanding this relationship allows retailers to improve their ordering system and better manage product inventory. This service, which has been introduced in the major convenient stores and many GMS (General Merchandise Store), is broadly expanding to the various industries such as clothing, food, drug stores, and many others.

Weathernews employs several different types of media to provide real-time weather information and weather-related lifestyle information to consumers that we like to think of as our "supporters" (whether individuals or the population at large). Weathernews is a vertically-integrated content provider that handles all the work involved in planning, producing and distributing content. Our supporters can access content through any of the several different media (the "channels" through which content is distributed). The management and operation of Weathernews content is based on a "trans-media" approach that lets our supporters receive content through the most convenient medium for them. "For the supporters, with the supporters" is the concept we use to describe our basic philosophy––which is bringing weather content to our supporters via our own media channels 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Our road management support service provides road managers and road-maintenance companies working for national and local governments with snow, ice and other crucial weather information, to help ensure road safety and efficient snow/ice clearing and plowing.

It is a fact that weather-induced natural disasters cause incalculable cost not only to our daily lives but also to our country's infrastructure and business activities. Weathernews has developed a base set of solutions called DIMINISH which contribute to reducing the impact of natural disaster to people. By providing accurate and timely weather analysis to public agencies, organizations or corporate entities involved in disaster relief or prevention, Weathernews can significantly improve the quality of information required. Our service helps in both the preventive and the relief decision_making process which is vital when weather_induced natural disasters occur.

Weather information (both current conditions and forecasts) and accompanying disaster information for train routes and the surrounding areas is important for railway companies.
