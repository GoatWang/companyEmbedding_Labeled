Business model[edit]
Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets.[5]
In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]

In April 2011 Zillow acquired Postlets, an online real estate listing creation and distribution platform. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.[7]
In November 2011, Zillow acquired Diverse Solutions for $7.8 million.[8]
In May 2012, Zillow acquired RentJuice, a software-as-a-service company which allows landlords and property managers to market and lease their rental properties through a set of online tools. RentJuice was acquired for $40 million.[9]
On October 31, 2012, Zillow acquired the real estate shopping and collaboration platform, Buyfolio.[10]
On November 5, 2012, Zillow acquired Lincoln, NE based mortgage technology company Mortech for $17 million.[11]
On November 26, 2012, Zillow acquired HotPads for $16 million. HotPads, founded in 2005, lists real estate and rental listings on a map-based web interface.[12]
On August 19, 2013, Zillow acquired StreetEasy for $50 million.[13]
On July 16, 2014, Zillow acquired Retsly, a Vancouver, B.C.-based startup that helps developers access real-estate data from multiple listing services (MLS).[14]
On July 28, 2014, Zillow announced a deal to buy Trulia for $3.5 billion.[1][15]
On February 17, 2015, Zillow announced the completion of its acquisition of Trulia and the formation of the Zillow Group brand portfolio.[16]
On July 22, 2015, Zillow Group announced it would acquire Dotloop for $108 million.[17]

On August 2, 2016, Zillow Group acquired Bridge Interactive.[19]

Website features[edit]
Zillow has data on 110 million homes across the United States, not just those homes currently for sale.[20] In addition to giving value estimates of homes, it offers several features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years), aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. Where it can access appropriate public data, it also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made, such as a recently remodeled kitchen. Zillow provides an application programming interface (API) and developer support network.[21][22][23]
In December 2006, Zillow launched three new pieces of functionality: allowing users to post homes for sale and set a "Make Me Move" price (an informal way to pre-market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. In 2006, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer Bird's Eye View, a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth, that shows (in certain areas) clearer aerial photographs taken from airplanes rather than conventional satellite imagery.[24] Zillow uses this functionality for entertainment-focused features on famous homes.[25]
In December 2009, Zillow expanded its services to include the rental market.[26] The addition of rental listings enabled users to list a home for rent and search for both rental homes and homes for sale.
In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate.[27]
Zillow Mortgage Marketplace[edit]
On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information.[28][29]
Zillow Mobile[edit]
Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location.

April 29, 2009 - iPhone application
March 18, 2010 - Android application
April 2, 2010 - iPad application
March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application
July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application [30]
November 27, 2013 - Windows 8.1 application
November 2015 - Apple TV application

Zillow Advice[edit]
On December 16, 2008, Zillow launched Zillow Advice, allowing people to ask real estate questions online and get answers from the Web site's community of experts.[31]
Real estate market reports[edit]
Zillow produces home value reports for the nation and over 130 metropolitan statistical areas. The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity,[32][not in citation given] short sales and foreclosure transactions.
Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey.[33] The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market.
Report for the Bellingam area[edit]
On August 26, 2016 the Bellingham Herald published housing prices and rental statistics obtained from Zillow[34] which said that these statistics conflicted with those obtained from the Housing Finance Agency.[35]
Neighborhood Boundary Maps (GIS Data)[edit]
The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}
Website activity[edit]
The company said it had more than 24 million unique visitors in September 2011, representing year-over-year growth of 103 percent.[36][37] Of those users, 90% own a home and more than three quarters are looking to buy or sell within the next two years, helping others to buy or sell or looking to rent. Zillow claims over 50 million U.S. homes have been viewed. In some cities more than 90% of all homes that exist have been viewed, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle.
Zestimate[edit]
Zillow determines an estimate ("Zestimate," pronounced "ZEST-imate") for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including public data and sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value.[38] The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In many U.S. states, information on the transfer prices of real estate is readily available and accessible by the general public and is not exclusively held in realtors' databases.[39]. Zillow also supplies Zestimate Accuracy ratings for varies cities on its website.[40]
In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes on both the Zillow website and all of its mobile apps.[41]
On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006.
Critique of Zestimate accuracy[edit]
In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they "often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible."[42]
In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission[43] stating that Zillow was "intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading." In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint,[44] which was later withdrawn by the NCRC.[citation needed]
Real estate agents with specific market knowledge may be more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home, room flow, landscaping, views, traffic noise, and privacy. These factors have been called unzillowables, a term coined in the real estate blogosphere.[citation needed]
Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000.[45]
Controversy and lawsuits[edit]
While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations.[46] Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable.
In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code.[47] On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015.[48] Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that "the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees."[49]
In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging "sexual torture"[50] and “the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.”[51] According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an “adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.”[50] Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a "modern day Animal House."[52] On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings.[53]
In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and decease letter to the author of McMansion Hell, a blog of original content which satirized photos of ostentatious homes found on the site.[54] Zillow's claims were described by legal experts as lacking merit and the company was accused of using its resources to infringe on free speech.[55]

SEATTLE, July 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow® Group (NASDAQ:   Z), which houses a portfolio of the largest and most vibrant real estate and home-related brands on mobile and Web, today announced its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a stock dividend of non-voting Class C capital stock. 
On August 14, 2015, all shareholders of record of Zillow Group's Class A and Class B common stock as of 5:00 p.m. E.D.T. on July 31, 2015, the record date of the dividend, will receive a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each share of Class A and Class B common stock held by them as of the record date.  
The issuance of Class C capital stock is an extension of Zillow Group's dual-class structure, whereby Zillow Group's co-founders Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink hold Class B shares. The Class C dividend enables the company to continue its focus on long-term growth and innovation, while maintaining the flexibility to issue additional stock for strategic business decisions and to retain and attract the best employees. 
"Our Board approved this stock split to ensure we can continue to make the best decisions for the company's long-term growth," said Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Zillow Group. "Our Board, management, and the shareholders who have chosen to invest in Zillow, view the company in terms of decades, not quarters or years. And we are in the very early days of a massive opportunity in front of us." 
Application to the Nasdaq Stock Market has been made to list the Class C capital stock.  Following the issuance date of the dividend, Zillow Group expects the Class C capital stock will trade under the ticker symbol "Z" and the Class A common stock will trade under the ticker symbol "ZG". 
Additional Details on Stock Dividend
The shareholders of Zillow, Inc. and the stockholders of Trulia, Inc., on December 18, 2014, approved the authorization of the Class C capital stock in Zillow Group's amended and restated articles of incorporation.  The Class C capital stock is a non-voting class of capital stock that shares equally with the Class A common stock and Class B common stock with respect to all economic benefits.
The board of directors approved the dividend in order to create a liquid trading market in the Class C capital stock.  Issuance of the Class C capital stock dividend is intended to provide Zillow Group with the flexibility to use the Class C capital stock for a variety of purposes, including to contribute to equity incentive plans used to attract new talent and retain and motivate employees, raise equity capital and make strategic acquisitions, without diluting the relative voting interests of holders of Zillow Group's Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  Additional details regarding the Class C capital stock were outlined in the joint proxy statement/prospectus included in Zillow Group's registration statement on Form S-4, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with Zillow's acquisition of Trulia and declared effective by the SEC on November 17, 2014.
In connection with declaring the dividend, the board of directors, on the recommendation of the special committee, required that the company's founders, Richard Barton, the Executive Chairman of Zillow Group and Lloyd Frink, the Vice Chairman of Zillow Group, enter into transfer restriction agreements and non-competition agreement amendments.  Beginning on the date on which they no longer serve on the Zillow Group board of directors, the agreements will require Mr. Barton, Mr. Frink and their affiliates to transfer at least one share of Class B common stock for each two shares of Class C capital stock transferred.  The agreements also extend the duration of Messrs. Barton's and Frink's existing non-competition obligations from one to three years following termination of service with Zillow Group or any of its subsidiaries.  The special committee engaged Guggenheim Securities, as its financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of a dividend of Class C capital stock from a financial and capital markets perspective.

SEATTLE, June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:    Z and ZG), which houses a portfolio of the largest and most vibrant real estate and home-related brands on mobile and Web, today launched Builder Inform™, a cloud-based data dashboard that provides robust consumer insight data from Zillow Group to residential builders to help them make decisions about future projects.  
Builder Inform is available to builders who participate in Zillow Group's Promoted Communities, the exclusive advertising platform for builders on Zillow and Trulia. 








Powered by aggregated search data from millions of homebuyers on Zillow, as well as by Zillow Group's unique economic insights, Builder Inform includes a wide range of data to help builders make decisions about where they should build and what types of homes to build. Capabilities include tools to help builders understand consumer preferences – what types of homes Zillow users search for and favorite, by ZIP code – as well as insights into the current housing market and pricing trends.
Builder Inform allows builders to view and compare currently listed homes by type and location to help them understand what they should build based on consumer demand in a given zip code. 
"Builder Inform will provide our new construction partners with one-of-a-kind data and insights to help them understand real-time consumer and economic trends, customized for their local market," said Lucy Wohltman, Zillow Group vice president of new construction. "Bringing together economic data with our proprietary user data will help builders better identify new trends and areas to consider when scoping out their new projects. These insights can't be found on any other platform in the market today." 
More information about Builder Inform is available at www.zgbuilderinform.com

Zillow: An Overly Sanguine Hedge Fund Call - Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Zillow: An Overly Sanguine Hedge Fund CallMar.10.17 | About: Zillow Group, (ZG) Jeffrey Himelson Long/short equity, value, contrarian, research analystLinkedinSummaryA hedge fund believes Zillow can be a $50 billion company, which is roughly 8X its current market capitalization.The hedge fund is completely correct that Zillow is operating in a burgeoning industry, which will expand at a prodigious rate over the next few years.However, its estimates are egregiously optimistic, and there are significant risks on the horizon, which can substantially stymie Zillow's growth.Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) has recently been touted by a hedge fund as its best pick. In November 2016, a well-known hedge fund in Australia, Caledonia, took a stake in Zillow and explained that the company was its largest ever bet in its 22-year history. Caledonia's portfolio manager, Michael Messara, explained that his fund believed there was significant upside: "[W]e believe Zillow will be a $US50 billion enterprise value company - around seven times the size it is today." (Zillow has since fallen a bit, so now its estimate is closer to 8x its current level). The fund believes the Australian online real estate is a blueprint for other markets and thinks that the US will follow suit. However, I believe this fund is being way too sanguine about Zillow's future prospects, as there are significant risks on the horizon. 

 Source: Zillow.com Roadmap to My Analysis I will first give a brief overview of Zillow's business. Then I'll quickly discuss recent news and will provide a more granular overview of how the company's business has been operating. Following that section, I'll discuss the competitive landscape. Afterwards, I'll discuss its recent performance, then highlight various risks, and will discuss potential negative and positive catalysts. I'll then conclude with a valuation section and summarize my findings.
 About Zillow Group Zillow Group, Inc. operates real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the Web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help people find information about homes and connect with local professionals. Zillow Group's brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling, financing and home improvement. Zillow's database has more than 110 million U.S. homes - homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market. In addition, Zillow Group provides advertising services to tens of thousands of real estate agents and rental and mortgage professionals, helping them connect to consumers. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow's mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 68 million homes and added more than 456 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. Zillow also uses proprietary automated valuation models to provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on more than 100 million U.S. homes. Its home-related marketplaces benefit from network effects. As more consumers go to its mobile applications and websites to use its products and services, more real estate, rental and mortgage professionals contribute content to distinguish themselves, thereby making its marketplaces more useful and attracting additional consumers. As of December 31, 2016, it had published more than 2.6 million reviews, including more than 2.3 million reviews of local real estate agents and approximately 336,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by users on Zillow. Recent Acquisition In February 2015, Zillow closed on its $2.5 billion acquisition of Trulia. Zillow now operates under the name Zillow Group, which is comprised of four real estate brands: Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, and Naked Apartments.
 

 Source: Zillowgroup.com At the time of the acquisition, CEO Spencer Rascoff said: "I am excited about how we are positioned relative to the size of the opportunity. There is $13 billion spent in real estate advertising and I think Zillow Group is poised to benefit as that real estate advertising budget moves online." It is notable to mention that Caledonia believed Zillow is worth $50 million while Zillow's CEO identified its total addressable market as $13 billion. Does Caledonia sound a bit too sanguine to you now? Explanation of Dual Shares I just briefly want to mention why Zillow has two ticker symbols. In August 2015, shares of Zillow Group split into two trading tickers: Z and ZG. Zillow created a new class of shares, non-voting Class C shares, that was divvied up between its Class A and B shareholders. The C shares trade under the ticker symbol Z while Class A shares trade under the ticker ZG. The company created this new stock to make acquisitions and compensate executives. However, for investment purposes, there is no material difference between these two share classes. More Granular Business Explanation Zillow generates revenue through two separate avenues: marketplace advertising and display advertising. It sells its advertising to real estate, rental, and mortgage professionals. Premier Agent Advertising New Auction-Based Pricing Platform Before the latest quarter, Zillow charged customers for its Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on its buyers' agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. However, in the most recent quarter, it implemented a new auction-based pricing method for its Premier Agent product. In this new system, it determines cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month.
 This allows for dynamic pricing for the cost per impression, based upon the demand in that particular zip code. This new pricing method complements its self-serve account interface, which it introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. Management did not comment on how this change has been impacting its business, and in the 10-K said: "We are unable to predict whether this change to our pricing method will have a material impact on net sales, revenue, or other results of operations." In its earnings call, management gave further color on how the model will benefit "elite agents": "With this new model, each agent pays the same price for an impression based on what all agents are willing to spend in a market. This transparent system benefits the best Premier Agent advertisers and is consistent with our strategy of focusing on elite agents who excel at lead conversion and provide great service to our home shoppers. We continue to he see the nation's best real estate agents, those who convert leads at high rates, gain transaction share in their respective markets as a result of advertising with Zillow Group." While this change benefits higher-performing agents, it also hurts other agents. As such, the number of Premier Agent advertisers on its platform declined on a y/y basis. Management is making a bet that the benefit of having an auction-based system will offset the decline in the number of agents willing to advertise on its platform. One corollary benefit of this is that customers will be offered advertisements with more experienced and effective agents. This could lead to more customer loyalty and drive consumer growth on the platform. On the other hand, by limiting the number of agents on the platform, Zillow is reducing the overall demand for ad space. In the next few quarters, we will have more information to determine if this change is inevitably beneficial or harmful to Zillow's business.
 My take is that it will overall be a negative change. I believe that initially, higher-performing agents will be willing to pay more for these ads, which will offset the declining demand from fewer overall agents selling ads on the platform. However, I think once these agents get a critical mass of deals though Zillow, they won't be reliant on the platform, as word-of-mouth is a prevalent method to get referred to an agent. Once an agent has a certain number of happy customers, they can rely on those customers referring their friends and family to them. At that point, those agents can reduce their marketing expenditures on Zillow. Of course, this is just my theory, and I could be wrong. Display Advertising In addition to the marketplace advertising, Zillow generates revenue through display advertisements. Its display advertising primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost-per-click basis. It offers customers display advertising opportunities on its mobile applications through display ads that are optimized for the mobile experience, on its home page, and on individual web pages through graphical displays and text links. Management has been less focused on this business segment and revenue has begun to decline from display advertising. New Construction - Emerging Marketplace In the earnings call, management discussed this new marketplace and believed its total addressable market opportunity is $1 billion for this new segment. This platform allows homebuilders to advertise their available lots and styles to the public. Builders can display real-time lot availability on search results and maps. Further, builders will be able to receive information on consumer behavior in this platform. This will enable them to assess local market conditions and determine user preferences, helping them make decisions regarding their product positions, land acquisition, and how to improve their marketing efforts. As this is a new platform, it remains to be seen if builders will adopt using it.
 Competition Zillow has two main competitors left, after the acquisition of Trulia.com: Realtor.com and redfin.com. Realtor.com was acquired by News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA) and recently settled a lawsuit against Zillow for $130 million. The lawsuit regarded a dispute over trade secrets and executive poaching. When it comes to availability and accuracy of data, Zillow doesn't compare to its competitors. For the real estate sector, the best information comes from multiple listing services (MLS) sites. An MLS is a suite of services that real estate brokers use to establish contractual offers of compensation (among brokers) and accumulate and disseminate information to enable appraisals. Today, through more than 800 MLSs, brokers share information on properties they have listed and invite other brokers to cooperate in their sale in exchange for compensation if they produce the buyer. Sellers benefit by increased exposure to their property. Buyers benefit because they can obtain information about all MLS-listed properties while working with only one broker. As the official site of the National Association of Realtors, Realtor.com receives listing data from more than 800 MLSs. This data is used to populate its consumer-facing home listing service, which covers more than 97% of all MLSs listed for sale properties. Moreover, Redfin is a broker, so it is also able to access MLSs to secure data for its listing website. In contrast, because Zillow is not a broker, it isn't able to receive such broad access to MLSs. As such, Zillow must rely on the expensive and complicated process of entering into separate agreements with multiple data providers. This amalgamation of data collection can lead to less reliable data that can mislead its users and lead to them favoring the more reliable competitors. In fact, Zillow lists this risk in its 10-K as a risk factor:    "When deals cannot be made, Zillow relies upon individual agents sharing their listings with Zillow, either manually or through Internet data exchanges, publicly available information, or syndication partners. Our ability to attract users to our mobile applications, websites and other tools depends to some degree on providing a robust number of current, high-quality for-sale and rental listings. To provide these listings, we maintain relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listing aggregators, multiple listing services, property management companies, home builders, other third-party listing providers, and homeowners and their real estate agents to include listing data in our services. Many of our agreements with real estate listing providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated with limited notice. The loss of existing relationships with listing providers, whether due to termination of agreements or otherwise, changes to our rights to use or timely access listing data, or an inability to continue to add new listing providers, may negatively impact our listing data quality. This could reduce user confidence in the sale and rental data we provide and make us less popular with consumers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition." 
 By not having the most comprehensive database and by having to go through more expensive efforts to obtain its listing information, Zillow is at a serious disadvantage to its competitors. Competing For Ad Dollars Zillow also faces competition for ad dollars from several other competitors. Specifically, it competes with various real estate websites and applications, local brokerage services, general search engines, and social media sites (i.e. LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Instagram). Additionally, Zillow faces competition for these ad dollars from traditional media operators such as newspapers, TV, magazines, and home/apartment publications. Zillow did recently partner with Facebook to offer a precision-ad targeting program. This program enables real estate agents to connect to Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or Trulia, which it recently acquired. The technology identifies home shoppers or sellers who are using Zillow or Trulia and connects with them on Facebook. Agents are able to feature a specific listing or highlight new listings for recently sold homes. The company says the feature available on desktop and mobile is a chance to connect with shoppers and sellers on a social media platform that they are using every day. Although it will be beneficial for agents to get use of Facebook's customer data, there are two negative implications of this partnership. First, although we don't know the exact figures, I'm sure Zillow has to pay Facebook a hefty amount for this targeted advertising, which will eat into its margins. Moreover, this underscores the risk that Facebook represents. At Facebook's size, there is just no way that Zillow could compete with it if Facebook decided to offer a similar platform. I just don't see Zillow having any real competitive advantage to thwart Facebook from encroaching on its business. Recent Performance In the latest quarter, Zillow reported revenue of $227.6 million, increasing 34% y/y, which exceeded the high end of its guidance range. The largest segment of its revenue came from its Premier Agent Revenue, which increased 32% y/y to $164.3 million. An important figure that was disclosed was that there was a 100% y/y increase in the number of agent advertisers that spend more than $5,000 per month. However, the number of Premier Agent advertisers declined to 84,151, as its new auction-based pricing model benefits the top performing agents, as I discussed before.
 Now I'll break down the other business segments:  Other real estate revenue (includes agent services, StreetEasy, Naked Apartments, rentals, and its new construction portal) increased 145% y/y to $29.8 million. Mortgage revenue increased 41% y/y to $16.5 million. Display revenue decreased 20% y/y to $17 million.  Overall, Zillow reported a GAAP net loss of $23.5 million (roughly 10% of revenue) compared to a GAAP net loss of $25.7 million (about 15% of revenue) in Q4 2015. Upon a cursory look, Zillow's adjusted EBITDA numbers appear to be trending in the right direction. In this quarter, Zillow reported adjusted EBITDA of $54.7 million (about 24% of revenue), which is a significant increase from last quarter's $20.4 million (about 12% of revenue). However, its adjusted EBITDA figure isn't such an accurate measure of the true nature of its business. Zillow's adjusted EDITDA excludes stock-based compensation, which is a significant figure for Zillow. In 2016, Zillow reported adjusted EBITDA of $144.8 million, but stock-based compensation was a staggering $106 million. That means, when including stock-based compensation, it had an EBITDA of just $37.9 million. Moreover, when including the one-time litigation settlement with News Corp., Zillow had -$92.1 million in EBITDA in 2016. Guidance Management guided that it expects to exceed the $1 billion annual revenue mark in 2017 and guided for revenue to be in the range of $1.03-1.05 billion. The midpoint of this guidance represents a 23% y/y increase in revenue. It also guided for adjusted EBITDA of between $190 million and $210 million. The midpoint for this guidance represents 19% of revenue. However, that guidance excludes stock-based compensation, which is expected to be between $106-111 million. 


 Source: Zillow Q4 Press Release Finally, the company guided for a net loss of between $20.2 million and $40.2 million. This full-year net loss would represent a vast improvement from 2016's reported $220.4 million net loss. Even if you exclude the $130 million litigation settlement, that marks a significant improvement. Other Risks Copyright Infringement Litigation with VHT There is another notable litigation risk, which was explained in its 10-K: "In July 2015, VHT, Inc. ("VHT") filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging copyright infringement of VHT's images on the Zillow Digs site. In January 2016, VHT filed an amended complaint alleging copyright infringement of VHT's images on the Zillow Digs site as well as the Zillow listing site. In December 2016, the court granted a motion for partial summary judgment that dismissed VHT's claims with respect to the Zillow listing site. A federal jury trial began on January 23, 2017 that is expected to conclude in February 2017. We have not recorded an accrual related to this complaint as of December 31, 2016, as we do not believe a loss is probable. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable." StreetEasy Risk Additionally, there has been a lot of backlash from brokers when Zillow rolled out its Premier Agent feature on StreetEasy. Now brokers on StreetEasy are concerned that buyers will be directed to third-party agents who have no connection to the property rather than to the listing agent with the exclusive. This costs listing agents commissions, forcing them to split with brokers who get leads simply because they pay StreetEasy to be designated as a "Premier Agent." Previously, StreetEasy generated revenue from featured listings and display advertisements. This changed has led to the heads of some brokerage firms calling for a boycott of the platform, and there has been discussion of a Real Estate Board of New York-funded multiple listings service that's currently under development as a back-end platform for brokers to become a consumer-facing alternative to StreetEasy.
 Nonetheless, although this threat is a risk worth mentioning, its implications are relatively limited, as the revenue from StreetEasy is lumped together into a category with Naked Apartments, rentals, and New Construction, and in the aggregate, that category only generated roughly $30 million last quarter. Notable Negatives Reliance on Sales Teams    "Our sales teams are responsible for generating advertising customers across our mobile applications and websites. Our largest sales teams sell our Premier Agent products to real estate agents, and are located in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, and Irvine, California. We also have sales teams in Seattle, Washington and Denver, Colorado that sell our rental products to rental professionals. In addition, we have sales teams in Seattle, Washington, New York, New York and Lincoln, Nebraska that support sales in our mortgage marketplaces and display advertising. We attract customers through a combination of outbound calling and inbound customer requests generated from our websites and event marketing activities. We also maintain a field sales team in San Francisco, California and New York, New York to specifically target larger advertising customers in the real estate and related content categories, such as real estate brokerages, home builders, lenders and home service providers, as well as advertisers in the telecommunications, automotive, insurance and other industries."  Relying on a sales team to sell ads to real estate agents does not bode well for Zillow's scalability. Sales teams are expensive and Zillow has not shown its ability to retain these real estate agents on the platform for the long term. It did increase the number of advertisers spending more than $5,000 per month by more than 100% y/y in the last quarter. However, it is shedding the total number of agent advertisers to do so, as it makes advertising on the platform more expensive for less-effective agents. I believe that these top agents will hit a critical mass of customers, and will be able to rely on word-of-mouth advertising to sustain their business, and thus stop their marketing efforts on Zillow. If this process occurs, there will be significant churn in terms of agent advertisers on the platform, and Zillow will not be able to end its reliance on an expensive sales team. Moreover, with the best agents leaving the platform, Zillow's ad costs will face a cap.
 Convertible Notes In December 2016, the company issued $460 million in 2% convertible senior notes due in 2021. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2% per year, payable semiannually, but can be converted into Zillow's Class C stock. The conversion rate is $52.36 per share so these very long-dated convertible notes can be quite dilutive and limit the upside beyond the conversion price. Positives Percentage of Online Real Estate Market According to comScore, Zillow Group's brands represent nearly three quarters of market share of all mobile exclusive visitors to the real estate category. Moreover, the majority of its traffic comes directly, and is not dependent on search engines, which shows that Zillow Group's brands have strong customer recognition and loyalty. Moreover, its traffic continues to expand. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, traffic to its consumer brands Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads and Naked Apartments grew to 140.1 million average monthly unique users, an increase of 13% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. Although these figures are positive, I don't see how Zillow can thwart off competition. Management is investing in its brand to generate customer loyalty, but there really is nothing to stop competitors from offering a similar product. Facebook could easily enter and dominant this space. Moreover, with an expensive, and sometimes inaccurate, method to get listings onto its site, Zillow faces a risk in offering customers a smaller selection of houses and apartments to sort though as compared to its competitors. Market Opportunity According to data published by the National Association of Realtors, in 2016, approximately 5.6 million existing and 592,000 new homes in the U.S. were sold for an aggregate transaction value of approximately $1.8 trillion. U.S. real estate agents and brokers spent an estimated $5.9 billion on residential advertising in 2016 according to data compiled from Borrell Associates (its full report is behind a paywall). Moreover, the same report from Borrell Associates found that U.S. real estate developers spent an estimated $1 billion on residential advertising in 2016.
 For the rental market, Borrell Associates estimated that $1.9 billion was spent on advertising rental properties in 2016. Moreover, it estimated that U.S. residential mortgage providers spent approximately $6.2 billion on marketing their services and loan products to mortgage borrowers. During the earnings call, management discussed how it believes "the opportunity in front of [them] remains massive." To give an indication of its future growth opportunity, management used an estimate that in 2016, there were approximately $87 billion in total real estate commissions in the U.S. Of that commission revenue, it earned $604 million in Premier Agent revenue, and delivered nearly 17 million leads to Premier Agents. It further estimated that those leads earned about $4.4 billion in commissions, which represents roughly 5% of all commissions in the U.S. Management said its leads represent a small percentage of the total, but was bullish about its ability to grow that percentage and cited solid growth from last year. In 2015, it generated 12 million leads or 3.9% of U.S. commissions. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the housing market may face a boon from Millennials moving out of their parents' house in the next few years. The share of Millennials that are living with their parents has been growing at a prodigious rate and is now over 33%. 

 Source: Zillow Presentation Net Operating Loss Carryforwards As of December 31, 2016, the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $893.3 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.5 million, and net tax credit carryforwards of approximately $24.3 million. It is notable to mention that if Zillow is acquired, the acquirer will have not have the use of these tax loss carryforwards since it will be an "ownership change" under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, which will limit the acquirer's use of them. However, if Zillow does eventually become profitable, it can use these to offset its taxable income.
 Valuation There is no direct competitor to compare Zillow against, so I found a peer group that I believe provides a good comparison. Each of these companies runs a platform with a similar type of business model to Zillow. The comparable companies I've identified are Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Yelp (NYSE:YELP), and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). On a relative basis, I believe Zillow is overvalued. Its price-to-sales ratio is around double every other competitors. Now, you may think that is due to Zillow possibly having a much higher growth rate, however, that just isn't the case, as shown by the second chart below. Zillow's quarterly revenue growth is not much higher than Expedia's or Yelp's. Furthermore, each other company in peer group is currently profitable while Zillow is not, as shown by the third chart below: 

 ZG PS Ratio (Annual) data by YCharts 

 Z Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts 

 Z Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts Now, some may argue that Zillow is investing in the future by growing its brand and generating a mass of users before focusing on profitability. However, I do not believe it is creating any sort of competitive advantage. Moreover, its reliance on an amalgamation of services to get listings is a significant risk that can completely up-end its business. Further, I don't see it thwarting off Facebook, if it decides to enter this market; Zillow just does not have any way to compete with the depth and breadth of Facebook's collection of user data.
 Final Remarks I believe Caledonia was way too optimistic in its evaluation of Zillow. Although I believe Zillow is operating in a growing market, I believe there are too many risks to justify its current valuation, and it is certainly not going to increase 8x its current level, as Caledonia's analysis suggested.
