Taptica (AIM: TAP), a global end-to-end mobile advertising platform for advertising agencies and brands, is pleased to announce that it is sponsoring the next VentureBeat Roadshow event, which is taking place in San Francisco on Thursday 19 May. The VentureBeat Roadshow is a series of global events hosted by VentureBeat, a leading online source for news and perspective on technology innovation, covering issues affecting the advertising and marketing industry.  
 
The event will focus on eliminating silos between mobile product and marketing teams, and will discuss how disparate conversations between these teams remain a major issue. Speakers will include:
·     Casey Winters, Product Lead, Growth, Pinterest
·     Rob Sturtz, Mobile Product Leader, Glassdoor
·     Stewart Rogers, Director, Marketing Technology, VentureBeat Insight
·     Jeremy Wacksman, Vice President, Marketing and Product, Zillow
 
"The goal of this event is to provide deep context, to deconstruct key issues around siloed mobile teams and to help executives make smarter decisions on mobile strategies moving forward," said Aaron Golden, CRO, VentureBeat.
 
Attendees will hear from leading mobile marketers, growth executives and product veterans through case studies, VB Insights and networking with industry peers. All attendees will also receive a free copy of VB Insights' latest report, which reveals the current and future state of holistic mobile marketing and product management.
 
Hagai Tal, CEO of Taptica, added: "We are excited to be partnering with VentureBeat for this event and look forward to welcoming such a strong line-up of presenters, which reflects Taptica's position as a leader within the industry. By supporting the VentureBeat roadshow, we hope to encourage a dialogue about the gaps that exist across departments and how to address them to increase revenue and mobile user engagement to unlock brands' full mobile potential."
 
The event is being held at The Village, which is located at 969 Market Street in San Francisco, California, on Thursday 19 May from 5-8pm PDT.
 
All proceeds from the event will benefit Sleep Train Foster Kids, a non-profit that was created in 2008 to make a positive impact on the lives of thousands of foster children in need.

Introducing Taptica’s New VP Product Management, Tal Dagan










January 12, 2017 | Article written by Carly Morris
We’re starting off 2017 with some exciting news about a big new addition to the Taptica team, as Tal Dagan joins our ranks as VP Product Management.
We’re thrilled to introduce our newest Taptican, an experienced leader with degrees in Business Administration, Computer Science, Executive Education, and Strategic Marketing Management, as well as years of industry experience at Haystackz, Flash Networks, Comverse, and Emblaze. With a passion for technology, products, and off-road bikes, Tal is ready to drive Taptica’s game plan to the next level.
 
“Until now, the market has been fragmented, making it hard to develop coherent products. However as things begin to consolidate, more efficient tools can be developed, resulting in higher conversion rates and lower costs for advertisers,” says Tal.
 
But, why the major shift? 
Presently, the ad tech industry is a given. As the world becomes increasingly mobile-first and connected, embracing programmatic is no longer a leap of faith, but a reality. This has pushed traditionally market-focused organizations to fall flat, as they squander their resources on further dissecting an already defined market. 
The resulting move toward a stronger product focus is critical, as the key issue facing the mobile ad tech industry is no longer about attracting new users to join the market, but addressing the specific needs therein. 
Still, this is not to say that Taptica will be straying from our consumer-sided focus either. While product is certainly a key focal point, we still appreciate the importance of taking all sides into consideration for fully-informed decision making and improvement. A keen market focus will always be essential to stay on top of the latest mobile innovations.
As Taptica continues to lead the ranks in product growth and development, you can expect to see Tal’s energized vision take center stage as he pioneers new initiatives to perfect the relationship between our product and our partners.  
Welcome aboard, Tal!

"The goal of this event is to provide deep context, to deconstruct key issues around siloed mobile teams and to help executives make smarter decisions on mobile strategies moving forward," said Aaron Golden, CRO, VentureBeat.
 
Attendees will hear from leading mobile marketers, growth executives and product veterans through case studies, VB Insights and networking with industry peers. All attendees will also receive a free copy of VB Insights' latest report, which reveals the current and future state of holistic mobile marketing and product management.
 
Hagai Tal, CEO of Taptica, added: "We are excited to be partnering with VentureBeat for this event and look forward to welcoming such a strong line-up of presenters, which reflects Taptica's position as a leader within the industry. By supporting the VentureBeat roadshow, we hope to encourage a dialogue about the gaps that exist across departments and how to address them to increase revenue and mobile user engagement to unlock brands' full mobile potential."
 
The event is being held at The Village, which is located at 969 Market Street in San Francisco, California, on Thursday 19 May from 5-8pm PDT.
 
All proceeds from the event will benefit Sleep Train Foster Kids, a non-profit that was created in 2008 to make a positive impact on the lives of thousands of foster children in need.
