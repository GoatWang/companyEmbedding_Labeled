(IPG)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor  Ad giant Interpublic Group (NYSE:IPG) is off 10.2% after a rough miss in its Q2 earnings, as foreign exchange and divestitures took out a modest organic revenue gain. "Client spending in the quarter reflected increased caution, but we don't see evidence of a broad-based economic downturn," said CEO Michael Roth. Revenues fell 1.7% for the quarter, hit by a foreign exchange negative impact of 1.1% and negative impact from net divestitures of 1%. That left an organic increase of 0.4%, made up of organic gains of 0.7% in the U.S. and no organic change internationally. Operating expenses declined 0.9% in Q2; they were down 0.3% for the first half of 2017. Operating income fell to $206.5M from a year-ago $224.3M. Operating margin was 11% vs. a year-ago 11.7%. Cash, equivalents and marketable securities came to $660.8M at quarter's end, down from a year-ago $675.4M and $1.1B at year-end 2016. Total debt was $1.82B.

For all the attention paid to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), it’s the S&P 500 that’s relied on by insiders and institutional investors. It represents the industry standard for American 
large-cap indices.


The Dow is made up of just 30 stocks to the S&P 500’s 500, and it uses an unreliable and outdated price-weighting system where the S&P 500 relies on market cap in weighting its returns. This is why 
its long-term returns is a much more reliable gauge for the performance of large- and mega-cap stocks over time.

历史[编辑]
1902年， Alfred W. Erickson 成立； 1911年， H.K. McCann 成立； 1930年，两家公司合并为 McCann-Erickson（麦肯公司现在的全称）。 1960年， McCann Erickson 在 Marion Harper Jr. 的带领下成为了股份公司，公司也改名为 Interpublic（IPG），并在1971年上市。 IPG 下一步就是寻找合适的收购对象，灵狮成为了第一个猎物。
1928年，联合利华（Unilever）下属的广告公司—— Lintas（Lever International Advertising Services ，灵狮）成立。 Frank Lowe 在 1981年在伦敦创建 Lowe 集团， 1990年该集团被 IPG 收购。 1999年， Lowe & Partners 与 Lintas 合并； 2000年改名为 Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide ； 2002年1月，又改名为 Lowe & Partners Worldwide（励富）。
2001年3月，在经过了与 Havas 的一番角逐后， IPG 以 21 亿美元收购 True North 传播集团。世界广告史上的元老之一的 FCB（博达大桥广告）正式被纳入 IPG 的帐下。

IPG was founded as McCann-Erickson in September, 1930. In January, 1961, it was renamed Interpublic Group and created the first marketing services management holding company with McCann-Erickson as a subsidiary.[6]
In 2002, IPG suffered a precipitous drop in its stock price and reputation in an accounting scandal. In that year, Interpublic was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act over misrepresentation and artificially inflating its earnings.[7] As of November 18, 2008 (taking into account stock splits), IPG's stock has sold at approximately the same price it was on November 18, 1987.[8]
On August 13, 2002, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced to restate financial statements, due to uncertain economic environment and imbalances in certain accounts containing inter-Company activity and related balance sheet items that warranted further scrutiny.[relevant? – discuss][9] On November 13, the final amount of the restatement was reported to be $181.3 million, which reduced previously reported pre-tax income, substantially all of which is related to periods 2001 and prior reporting periods.[relevant? – discuss][10] On March 6, 2003, IPG restated the third quarter of 2002, after identifying $135.8 million of pre-tax charges relating to asset impairments and other operating expenses at Octagon Motor Sports.[relevant? – discuss][11] On September 15, 2005, IPG announced to restate earnings for fiscal 2000 through 2004, due to problems in accounting for revenue, acquisitions and lease expenses. The company also fired some employees in its investigation of accounting errors and potential misconduct.[relevant? – discuss][12] On March 22, 2006, IPG's financial review process resulted in restatement of 2005 interim periods and the recording of immaterial out-of-period adjustments to fourth quarter 2005 financial results.[relevant? – discuss][13]
Interpublic, working to simplify its structure after its overload of deals in the 1990s and 2000s, did not complete any acquisitions in 2005 and 2006.[citation needed] It disposed of 51 businesses in 2005 and 2006, primarily outside the U.S.; Interpublic said it exited 23 "loss-making international affiliates" in 2006.[14] Interpublic in April 2007 announced it agreed to buy Reprise Media, a search engine marketing firm.[citation needed] In July of that same year, FCB-Ulka Advertising Private Limited, a subsidiary of IPG, was renamed DRAFTFCB+Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd.[15]

Why Interpublic Group of Companies Inc Stock Fell Today
The advertising holding company slipped after its second-quarter report missed estimates.

What happened
Shares of The Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE:IPG) were tumbling today after the advertising umbrella company posted a disappointing second-quarter earnings report.
As of 11:39 a.m. EDT, the stock was down 12.6%.

So what 
Interpublic Group, which owns a number of ad agencies including McCann and FutureBrand, said overall revenue slipped 1.7% to $1.88 billion, below estimates at $1.95 billion. Organic revenue, which accounts for foreign currency translation, increased 0.4%. Adjusted earnings per share, meanwhile, fell from $0.33 a year ago to $0.27, missing estimates at $0.34. 
CEO Michael Roth noted "increased caution" among clients, but added that there is no evidence of a "broad-based economic downturn." He was otherwise optimistic, touting the company's investments in talent and success at industry award competitions.





Now what
Roth said the company's organic revenue growth for the year was headed for the low end of the previously announced 3%-4% range, which should offer some consolation to investors after the disappointing quarter. Roth also noted that clients had said they would be spending more in the second half of the year. 
The broader industry has also seen weaker performance during the first half of the year, a sign that Interpublic's troubles have more to do with macro concerns than with its own execution. If the company can meet its guidance for the year, the stock should recover today's losses.
