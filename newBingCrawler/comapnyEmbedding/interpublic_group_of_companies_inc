Michael Roth是现任IPG首席执行官.
历史[编辑]
1902年， Alfred W. Erickson 成立； 1911年， H.K. McCann 成立； 1930年，两家公司合并为 McCann-Erickson（麦肯公司现在的全称）。 1960年， McCann Erickson 在 Marion Harper Jr. 的带领下成为了股份公司，公司也改名为 Interpublic（IPG），并在1971年上市。 IPG 下一步就是寻找合适的收购对象，灵狮成为了第一个猎物。
1928年，联合利华（Unilever）下属的广告公司—— Lintas（Lever International Advertising Services ，灵狮）成立。 Frank Lowe 在 1981年在伦敦创建 Lowe 集团， 1990年该集团被 IPG 收购。 1999年， Lowe & Partners 与 Lintas 合并； 2000年改名为 Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide ； 2002年1月，又改名为 Lowe & Partners Worldwide（励富）。
2001年3月，在经过了与 Havas 的一番角逐后， IPG 以 21 亿美元收购 True North 传播集团。世界广告史上的元老之一的 FCB（博达大桥广告）正式被纳入 IPG 的帐下。

What happened
Shares of The Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE:IPG) were tumbling today after the advertising umbrella company posted a disappointing second-quarter earnings report.
As of 11:39 a.m. EDT, the stock was down 12.6%.

So what 
Interpublic Group, which owns a number of ad agencies including McCann and FutureBrand, said overall revenue slipped 1.7% to $1.88 billion, below estimates at $1.95 billion. Organic revenue, which accounts for foreign currency translation, increased 0.4%. Adjusted earnings per share, meanwhile, fell from $0.33 a year ago to $0.27, missing estimates at $0.34. 
CEO Michael Roth noted "increased caution" among clients, but added that there is no evidence of a "broad-based economic downturn." He was otherwise optimistic, touting the company's investments in talent and success at industry award competitions.





Now what
Roth said the company's organic revenue growth for the year was headed for the low end of the previously announced 3%-4% range, which should offer some consolation to investors after the disappointing quarter. Roth also noted that clients had said they would be spending more in the second half of the year. 
The broader industry has also seen weaker performance during the first half of the year, a sign that Interpublic's troubles have more to do with macro concerns than with its own execution. If the company can meet its guidance for the year, the stock should recover today's losses.

埃培智集團有限公司（Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG)、中國大陸翻譯為「埃培智市場諮詢」），世界四大廣告傳播集團之一(其他三家為宏盟集團、WPP集團和陽獅集團)，總部在紐約市。旗下擁有萬博宣偉公關（Weber Shandwick）、McCann-Erikson麥肯環球廣告、Lowe&Partners靈獅廣告、FCB博達大橋廣告和優勢麥肯、以及Initiative媒介等。[1]
Michael Roth是現任IPG執行長.
歷史[編輯]
1902年， Alfred W. Erickson 成立； 1911年， H.K. McCann 成立； 1930年，兩家公司合併為 McCann-Erickson（麥肯公司現在的全稱）。 1960年， McCann Erickson 在 Marion Harper Jr. 的帶領下成為了股份公司，公司也改名為 Interpublic（IPG），並在1971年上市。 IPG 下一步就是尋找合適的收購對象，靈獅成為了第一個獵物。
1928年，聯合利華（Unilever）下屬的廣告公司—— Lintas（Lever International Advertising Services ，靈獅）成立。 Frank Lowe 在 1981年在倫敦創建 Lowe 集團， 1990年該集團被 IPG 收購。 1999年， Lowe & Partners 與 Lintas 合併； 2000年改名為 Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide ； 2002年1月，又改名為 Lowe & Partners Worldwide（勵富）。
2001年3月，在經過了與 Havas 的一番角逐後， IPG 以 21 億美元收購 True North 傳播集團。世界廣告史上的元老之一的 FCB（博達大橋廣告）正式被納入 IPG 的帳下。

历史[编辑]
1902年， Alfred W. Erickson 成立； 1911年， H.K. McCann 成立； 1930年，两家公司合并为 McCann-Erickson（麦肯公司现在的全称）。 1960年， McCann Erickson 在 Marion Harper Jr. 的带领下成为了股份公司，公司也改名为 Interpublic（IPG），并在1971年上市。 IPG 下一步就是寻找合适的收购对象，灵狮成为了第一个猎物。
1928年，联合利华（Unilever）下属的广告公司—— Lintas（Lever International Advertising Services ，灵狮）成立。 Frank Lowe 在 1981年在伦敦创建 Lowe 集团， 1990年该集团被 IPG 收购。 1999年， Lowe & Partners 与 Lintas 合并； 2000年改名为 Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide ； 2002年1月，又改名为 Lowe & Partners Worldwide（励富）。
2001年3月，在经过了与 Havas 的一番角逐后， IPG 以 21 亿美元收购 True North 传播集团。世界广告史上的元老之一的 FCB（博达大桥广告）正式被纳入 IPG 的帐下。

IPG was founded as McCann-Erickson in September, 1930. In January, 1961, it was renamed Interpublic Group and created the first marketing services management holding company with McCann-Erickson as a subsidiary.[6]
In 2002, IPG suffered a precipitous drop in its stock price and reputation in an accounting scandal. In that year, Interpublic was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act over misrepresentation and artificially inflating its earnings.[7] As of November 18, 2008 (taking into account stock splits), IPG's stock has sold at approximately the same price it was on November 18, 1987.[8]
On August 13, 2002, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced to restate financial statements, due to uncertain economic environment and imbalances in certain accounts containing inter-Company activity and related balance sheet items that warranted further scrutiny.[relevant? – discuss][9] On November 13, the final amount of the restatement was reported to be $181.3 million, which reduced previously reported pre-tax income, substantially all of which is related to periods 2001 and prior reporting periods.[relevant? – discuss][10] On March 6, 2003, IPG restated the third quarter of 2002, after identifying $135.8 million of pre-tax charges relating to asset impairments and other operating expenses at Octagon Motor Sports.[relevant? – discuss][11] On September 15, 2005, IPG announced to restate earnings for fiscal 2000 through 2004, due to problems in accounting for revenue, acquisitions and lease expenses. The company also fired some employees in its investigation of accounting errors and potential misconduct.[relevant? – discuss][12] On March 22, 2006, IPG's financial review process resulted in restatement of 2005 interim periods and the recording of immaterial out-of-period adjustments to fourth quarter 2005 financial results.[relevant? – discuss][13]
Interpublic, working to simplify its structure after its overload of deals in the 1990s and 2000s, did not complete any acquisitions in 2005 and 2006.[citation needed] It disposed of 51 businesses in 2005 and 2006, primarily outside the U.S.; Interpublic said it exited 23 "loss-making international affiliates" in 2006.[14] Interpublic in April 2007 announced it agreed to buy Reprise Media, a search engine marketing firm.[citation needed] In July of that same year, FCB-Ulka Advertising Private Limited, a subsidiary of IPG, was renamed DRAFTFCB+Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd.[15]
