And, get more sales and higher profits as a result.

																												SPAR Group Secures New Joint Venture in China 




Tarrytown, NY - July 26, 2010 - SPAR Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SGRP) (the 
																												"Company" or "SPAR"), a leading supplier of retail merchandising and other 
																												marketing services throughout the United States and internationally, today 
																												announced the structuring of a new Joint Venture in China with its new partner 
																												Shanghai Wedone Marketing Consulting Co., Ltd. The new joint venture will 
																												provide merchandising and marketing services and have national market presence 
																												in the country.





SPAR Group has 
																											been Health Mart's dedicated marketing and merchandising services partner for 
																											the past four years, servicing more than 2,600 Health Mart® stores in all 50 
																											states. Part of the Company's services include consumer product planograms 
																											consisting of new product cut-ins of over 188,000 new items each year, 
																											implementing over 46,000 category resets each year and completing over 30,000 
																											annual visits and over 125,000 in-store hours. 





The new joint 
																											venture will be called SPAR (Shanghai) Marketing Management Company Ltd. and 
																											SPAR will own 51% of the Joint Venture while Shanghai Wedone Marketing 
																											Consulting will own 49% in accordance with the laws of the People's Republic of 
																											China. The new company will provide merchandising and related marketing 
																											services to manufacturers and retailers throughout China.




Shanghai 
																											Wedone Marketing Consulting is a comprehensive marketing management company 
																											that provides brand communication and retail marketing management service in 
																											China. The company works with more than 50 international brands such as 
																											Coca-Cola, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Swatch and several prominent 
																											Chinese brands such as Meng Niu Dairy, Guan Sheng Yuan and Dong-e E-jiao. Their 
																											business covers all tier 1, 2 and 3 cities in China equating to more than 150 
																											cities throughout the country.
"We 
																											are excited to join forces with SPAR to offer a national merchandising and 
																											marketing services group, providing our client manufacturing companies in China 
																											with a strategic advantage in one of the world's largest and fastest growing 
																											consumer markets. Our new venture provides for unlimited opportunities to 
																											capitalize on the growth of the region," stated James Qian, CEO of Shanghai 
																											Wedone Marketing.


Gary 
																											Raymond, President and Chief Executive Officer of SPAR Group, stated, "It is no 
																											secret that China is one of the fastest growing economies and most promising 
																											markets for our marketing and specialty merchandising services. We have 
																											researched diligently to find a synergistic partner to maximize the value of 
																											our presence in China and are pleased to reach an agreement with Shanghai 
																											Wedone. We believe the team at Shanghai Wedone Marketing is the optimal partner 
																											to continue our growth in China." 


Mr. 
																											Raymond continued, "Our strategy internationally has been to partner with 
																											companies that would benefit from our enhanced technology and expertise and 
																											combine that with an experienced local management team. Each subsidiary uses 
																											the same powerful proprietary U.S. based technology allowing logistics, 
																											communication and reporting, translated into their local language. This 
																											strategy remains in line with our objective to increase top line growth while 
																											improving our gross margins and profits. We see tremendous expansion potential 
																											not only in China, but in several other emerging market countries that we hope 
																											to take advantage of in the future."

SPAR Group, Inc., is a supplier of merchandising and other marketing services throughout the United States and internationally. The Company's operations are currently divided into two divisions: the Domestic Merchandising Services Division and the International Merchandising Services Division.













Domestic Merchandising Services Division
The Company's Domestic Merchandising Services Division provides nationwide merchandising and other marketing services primarily on behalf of consumer product manufacturers and retailers at mass merchandisers, electronics store chains, drug store chains and grocery stores. Included in its clients are home entertainment, general merchandise, health and beauty care, consumer goods and food products companies in the United States.
Merchandising services primarily consist of regularly scheduled dedicated routed services and special projects provided at the store level for a specific retailer or single or multiple manufacturers primarily under single or multi-year contracts or agreements. Services also include stand-alone large-scale implementations. These services may include sales enhancing activities such as ensuring that client products authorized for distribution are in stock and on the shelf, adding new products that are approved for distribution but not presently on the shelf, setting category shelves in accordance with approved store schematics, ensuring that shelf tags are in place, checking for the overall salability of client products and setting new and promotional items and placing and/or removing point of purchase and other related media advertising. Specific in-store services can be initiated by retailers or manufacturers, and include new store openings, new product launches, special seasonal or promotional merchandising, focused product support and product recalls. The Company also provides in-store event staffing services, RFID services, technology services and marketing research services.
International Merchandising Services Division
In July 2000, the Company established its International Merchandising Services Division to cultivate foreign markets, modify the necessary systems and implement the Company's business model worldwide by expanding its merchandising and marketing services business off shore. The Company formed an International Merchandising Services Division task force consisting of members of the Company's information technology, operations and finance groups to evaluate and develop foreign markets. In 2001, the Company established its Japanese subsidiary to provide the latest in-store merchandising and marketing services to the Japanese market. Subsequently, the Company translated several of its proprietary Internet-based logistical, communications and reporting software applications into Japanese and successfully implemented its software and business systems in Japan. Since 2003, the Company has expanded its international presence to Canada, South Africa, India, China, Australia, Turkey and Mexico. Today the Company operates in 9 countries whose population represents approximately 47% of the total world population.
Key to the Company's international strategy is the translation of several of its proprietary Internet-based logistical, communications and reporting software applications into the native language of any market the Company enters. As a result of this requirement for market penetration, the Company has developed translation software that can quickly convert its proprietary software into various languages. Through its computer facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, the Company provides worldwide access to its proprietary logistical, communications and reporting software. The Company is actively pursuing expansion into various other markets.
