發佈日期：2014年8月21日美亞鋼管是臺灣第一家鋼管專業製造工廠,自1959年創立以來,一直以製造及銷售高品質鋼管為職志,「品質的美亞」在一般結構鋼管、電線導管、鍍鋅鋼管、瓦斯輸送用鋼管等管材產品市場建立起品質保證且被客戶充分信賴的優良商譽,也建立有堅實穩固的經銷體系和領導性的市場佔有。     1980年第一家自力開發高品質拉內焊縫機械構造用碳鋼鋼管,成功的將臺灣鋼管工業技術水準向上提升了一大步,支持台灣汽車,機車工業及機械加工工業順利替代對於進口機械構造用碳鋼鋼管的依賴,為臺灣工業自主化作出重要的貢獻。     1988年為配合改善國民生活品質對於飲用水管材料的升級,投資增設不銹鋼管生產工廠,製造304系列不銹鋼配管,不銹鋼構造管,及309、316系列不銹鋼構造管,一方面充實美亞鋼管產品的完整性,更為提供市場更優質的鋼管製品作出具體努力。     1997年在廣州經濟技術開發區投資創立廣州美亞金屬製品有限公司,為大陸華南地區客戶提供快速敏捷的,襄括熱軋、冷軋、電解鍍鋅、熱浸鍍鋅、烤漆、電磁、不銹鋼、鋁板等全方位鋼捲鋼板的裁剪配送服務,以及熱軋、冷軋碳鋼與不銹鋼的鋼管生產銷售服務。開業多年來獲得廣大客戶的支持與鼓勵,銷售區域今日已擴及華東、華中,經營績效頗為良好。2003年廣州美亞已獲准改制為外商投資股份制公司,更名為廣州美亞股份有限公司。     2006年10月成立越南美亞股份有限公司,正式展開對東南亞國協市場經營的全新佈局。該公司正以高品質拉内焊縫機械構造用鋼管的製造銷售,服務以越南為中心的東南亞國協市場地區汽車、機車及機械加工客戶。     2013年12月投資泰國廣太精密製造有限公司,進一步跨足焊接鋼管製造與精 密抽管加工的高值化鋼管製造領域。該廠承製外徑12.7m m - 60.5m m ,厚度1.0 - 6.1m m 的汽機車及機械加工用鋼管,提供汽機車零部件精密加工使用,更迅速地服務泰國及東南亞國協地區客戶。     2014年5月成立美亞國際貿易股份有限公司,積極開拓各類型鋼管相關產品的內外銷市場,為台灣美亞與海內外合作工廠的產品尋找新的出路。美亞國際貿易也將開發鋼管以外的其他鋼鐵類與非鋼鐵類產品的貿易機會,擴增公司營業項目範圍,以發展成為綜合貿易商為企業目標。期許能夠以機動靈活的團隊,靈敏的市場嗅覺,善用現代行銷工具,開發各種商品進出口買賣,為美亞創造無限的新商機。
