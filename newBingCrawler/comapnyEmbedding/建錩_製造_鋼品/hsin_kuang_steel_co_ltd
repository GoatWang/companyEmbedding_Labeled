Company Description                    




                        Headquartered in Hsien, Taipei, Hsin Kuang Steel Co., Ltd. was established in 1967 and initially engaged in the processing of steel products. Since 1980 the company purchased and constructed Chungli plant, Xinwu plant, Guanyin plant and Changpin plant. At the same time, by introducing computerized and automotive cutting equipment, the company established four cutting centers, namely the steel plate, steel coil, steel and special steel cutter center. In 1991 the company passed the evaluation of Industrial Development Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs and became the only plant of thick steel plate cutting. In April, 1997 the company was listed and traded in the GreTai Securities Market and in September, 2000 listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In 1998 the company was granted ISO 9002 Certification and in September, 2001 granted ISO 9001 Certification. Since 2000 the company has transformed into a company with three cutting centers (medium thick and thick steel plate cutting center, special steel and hot rolled coil cutting center) and three professional steel logistics centers (Guanyin logistics center, Xinwu logistics center and Zhongqu (Changpin) logistics center). In all the cutting centers and logistics centers, its cargo handling, cutting and production, transportation management, and order and shipping services are operated by computer control. Combined with a sound management system, it has continuously improved the product quality, and through a coherent logistics and transportation network, it could quickly deliver the products to its customers to meet clients’ individual needs. Currently Hsin Kuang Steel Co., Ltd is principally engaged in the processing, wholesale and retail of steel plates, special steels, checkered irons, hot rolled coils, stainless steels, steel sections and steel structure components. The company also provides the cutting and processing services for the steel finished products. The company’s steel products are applied as steel structures, mechanic components, automobile parts, hardware components, computer casings, home appliance components and construction materials, among others. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the company obtained approximately 45%, 27%, 11% and 10% of its revenue from its steel plate, hot rolled coil, stainless steel and steel section businesses, respectively.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Company Description                    




                        Headquartered in Hsien, Taipei, Hsin Kuang Steel Co., Ltd. was established in 1967 and initially engaged in the processing of steel products. Since 1980 the company purchased and constructed Chungli plant, Xinwu plant, Guanyin plant and Changpin plant. At the same time, by introducing computerized and automotive cutting equipment, the company established four cutting centers, namely the steel plate, steel coil, steel and special steel cutter center. In 1991 the company passed the evaluation of Industrial Development Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs and became the only plant of thick steel plate cutting. In April, 1997 the company was listed and traded in the GreTai Securities Market and in September, 2000 listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In 1998 the company was granted ISO 9002 Certification and in September, 2001 granted ISO 9001 Certification. Since 2000 the company has transformed into a company with three cutting centers (medium thick and thick steel plate cutting center, special steel and hot rolled coil cutting center) and three professional steel logistics centers (Guanyin logistics center, Xinwu logistics center and Zhongqu (Changpin) logistics center). In all the cutting centers and logistics centers, its cargo handling, cutting and production, transportation management, and order and shipping services are operated by computer control. Combined with a sound management system, it has continuously improved the product quality, and through a coherent logistics and transportation network, it could quickly deliver the products to its customers to meet clients’ individual needs. Currently Hsin Kuang Steel Co., Ltd is principally engaged in the processing, wholesale and retail of steel plates, special steels, checkered irons, hot rolled coils, stainless steels, steel sections and steel structure components. The company also provides the cutting and processing services for the steel finished products. The company’s steel products are applied as steel structures, mechanic components, automobile parts, hardware components, computer casings, home appliance components and construction materials, among others. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the company obtained approximately 45%, 27%, 11% and 10% of its revenue from its steel plate, hot rolled coil, stainless steel and steel section businesses, respectively.
