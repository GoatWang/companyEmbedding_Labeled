History[edit]
Kalinganagar is a geographical unit consisting of a compact landmass of Danagadi and Sukinda Blocks of Jajpur district of Odisha, India. Kalingananar is neither a village nor a town.This is a name given to a geographical area by Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (IDCO)where the Govt. of Odisha aims at developing a steel-producers-hub.[3] IDCO has acquired the land from public, has developed infrastructure and has given it to various industries for setting up Steel Plants. The process has started from the early 1990s and the ex-CM, late Biju Patanaik, took the lead role in promoting the steel-hub. He had invited first, Swaraj Paul, a NRI British inndustrialist to set up a steel plant which did not materialize though. Later, the industrial activity grew when his son Naveen Patnaik became the CM of Odisha. Now there are around 15 steel plants which includes public sector plant like NINL, private sector plant like JSL, MESCO etc. Tata Steel is setting up its Steel Plant here which would become operation by 2014 end. During the early stage of TSL plant erection, there was some public resistance to Plant due to misunderstanding between IDCO and Public which led to police firing on 2 January 2006, killing 14 people and one policeman. Later the people accepted the Plant activity as govt. brought policy changes and Company offered better Compensation and R&R package and propagated inclusive-growth theory what they called as "TATA-Paribar-Scheme" for the affected people. Today lot of developmental activities are taking place in Kalinga Nagar area. Soon it will become a Municipality. There is peace and amity in the area. Tribal people are simple and hardworking here.Minerals like iron ore and chromite are located closer to this area. The river Brahmani flows nearby giving water opportunity. The area is also not prone to floods and cyclones. The district headquarters is at Jajpur Town and the nearest rail station is Jajpur-Keonjhar Road. Kalinganagar is located closer to Bhubaneswar, nearly 100 km, which is the state capital of Odisha. The area comes under Sukinda Legislative Assembly Constituency and Jajpur MP constituency. 2014: Rita Tarai(BJD) is the MP and Mr. Pritiranjan Gharai (BJD) is the MLA of Kalinga nanagr area.[4]

Vision[edit]
Kalinganagar Industrial Area is projected to be developed for a population of over 10 lakh by 2025 and it will be extended to 177 km2 (68 sq mi) as envisaged by the state government. In this connection, Lea Associates of South Asia in association with the School of Planning and Architect, New Delhi and the Centre for Environment and Planning (CEPT) presented a vision document to the Chief Minister for the development of Kalinganagar Industrial Area.
The Kalinganagar Industrial complex in Odisha has been a true realization of the socio-economic dream that would lead the State into a new era of prosperity. Made possible through dedicated efforts of the State Government over several years, the complex is slated to contribute to the net GDP of Odisha and provide its people with sustained employment and other forms of gainful engagement in the upcoming projects and their ancillaries.
After the success of Asia's first integrated steel plant set up by Tata Steel in the undivided Orissa-Bihar-Bengal in 1907, or the employment potential revealed by the Rourkela Steel Plant (operated by the state-owned Steel Authority of India), the demand for another mega steel plant in Odisha was strongly felt. This led Biju Patnaik, the then Chief Minister of Odisha to plan the Kalinganagar industrial complex, once 13000 acres of land was acquired in the Sukinda constituency of Jajpur district in 1992.
Today, the government is stepping up the presence of industry as coincidentally, the infrastructural boom in the global markets has generated high demands for steel. To strengthen the century old relationship between Odisha and Tata Steel, the company signed the MoU for its most ambitious steel project in Odisha on November 17, 2004. As per this MoU, the company will set up a six million ton green-field integrated steel plant at Kalinganagar in Jajpur District of Odisha.[6]
