PRESTAR 
					RESOURCES BERHAD (PRB) (123066-A),   was incorporated under 
					Malaysian Companies Act 1965 on 12 July 1984 under the name 
					of Prestar Industries Sdn Bhd as a private company. It was 
					subsequently converted into a Public Limited Company on 27 
					June 1994 and was listed on the Second Board of BURSA 
					Malaysia on 20 September 1995. On 1 October 2003, PRB was

PRB is principally an 
					investment holding company with subsidiary companies mainly 
					engaged in the steel-processing and steel-products 
					manufacturing activities with factories in Malaysia and 
					Vietnam.

					PRB started its manufacturing activities in 1984 involved in 
					the manufacturing of Wheelbarrows, Hand Trucks, Castors & 
					Platform Truck and etc.
After its successful Public Listing in 1995, PRB had 
					gradually diversified and expanded by moving upstream into 
					reprocessing of steel mother coils into slitted coils / 
					sheets (Coil Center) for the supply to Automotive, 
					Electrical & Electronic industries. This Coil Center is a 
					joint-venture between PRB and POSCO, the world third largest 
					steel mill from Korea.

					Meanwhile, PRB had also expanded into the manufacturing of 
					Carbon and Stainless Steel Pipes / Hollow Sections, Steel 
					Highway Guardrails, Steel Flat-bars, Steel Purlins, Steel 
					Shelving and Racking for storage usage.

					Today, PRB has transformed into a leading steel-processing / 
					manufacturing Group focusing on the following main 
					activities :


1.

							Slitting & shearing of Carbon & Stainless Steel 
							mother coils into

					The manufacturing activities of Prestar Group are mainly 
					carried out on two manufacturing plants with a total 
					built-up area of 60,000 sq.meter (650,000 Sq. ft.) on a

					Industrial Estate which houses its subsidiary companies 
					Prestar Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, Prestar Precision Tube Sdn 
					Bhd, Prestar Steel Pipes Sdn Bhd, Prestar Storage System 
					Sdn.Bhd., Prestar Engineering Sdn Bhd, Prestar Tooling Sdn 
					Bhd and Prestar Galvanising Sdn Bhd. and its

					Penang, northern part of Peninsular Malaysia, 
					with a built-up area of 24,000 sq.meter (260,000 sq.ft) on a

					land at Song Than III Industrial Park, Binh Duong Province, 
					Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in early 2008 to further expand 
					its production of Product Manufacturing Unit catering for 
					Vietnamese and Overseas market. With the lower labor and 
					operating cost in Vietnam, this facility would enhance 
					its competitiveness in the industry.

					sales and distributions of Hardware, Material Handling 
					Equipment, Steel Coils & Sheets with offices and warehouses in 
					Penang, Kuala Lumpur and

					strategic alliances with local and overseas partners to 
					further enhance its earning base as well as gaining 
					synergistic effects to the Group's existing activities.

It has become one of the largest production bases in the world, with exported products reaching 95%. Longteng grinding steel balls occupy most of the global high-end application markets.

- High precision control of product quality
- Base metal production lines of the wear-resisting material adopt a full set of short-stress rolling mill produced by Danieli Group, Italy. The base metal is made through continual rolling to realize high precision control of product quality.
- Hot rolled steel balls are made from round steel produced by steel mills through hot rolling and with whole process automation control. The ball is uniform in hardness, with the heart having high hardness, being low in broken rate, and high in impact value.

Note : 
1. Roundness: Spherical with little overfill or underfill within the national standard: GB-8649-88 and YB/T 091-2005
2. Metallographic structure: Substantially martensite with some retained Austenite, Bainite& Carbides
3. Breakage guarantee: -Nil breakages upon delivery
-Less than 1% in normal and correct operation conditions

            T-Beam:

A T-Beam is a load-bearing structure with a t-shaped cross section. The top of the t-shaped cross section serves as a flange or compression member in resisting compressive stresses. The web of the beam below the compression flange serves to resist shear stress and to provide greater separation for the coupled forces of bending.

Other uses for one way to make a T-beam to be more efficient structurally is to use an inverted T-beam with a floor slab or bridge deck joining the tops of the beams. Done properly, the slab acts as the compression flange.
