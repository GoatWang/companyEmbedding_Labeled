Mechel Begins Development of Bulk Ingot Market 
			Share it
			20 July 2017Moscow, Russia – July 20, 2017 – Mechel PAO (MOEX: MTLR; NYSE: MTL), a leading Russian mining and metals company, reports that Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant has cast its first oversize 50-tonne ingot. The new technology for production of bulk ingots from specialty steels will enable Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant to enter a new segment of the oversize product market and make supplies both domestically and internationally.Bulk ingots are produced by very few companies globally as their production requires equipment capable of simultaneous casting of necessary volumes of quality steel while maintaining special temperatures and speed in pouring steel into a mould. The mould is also technically difficult to produce, with the plant’s mould developed by the plant’s own experts who managed to attain maximum precision in its making.
The plant has produced bulk ingots before, but their maximum weight reached 17.5 tonnes. Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s 50-tonne ingots will be supplied as billets to Mechel’s another steel facility, Urals Stampings Plant. Urals Stampings Plant will use them to produce a new type of product — bulk forgings which are highly in demand in mechanical engineering.
“Production of a high-quality 50-tonne ingot is an event of strategic importance for Mechel’s steel division. Today only a few facilities in Russia and abroad can produce such ingots. While streamlining this production process, our experts applied groundbreaking design, engineering and technical solutions. We plan to build on this development, as we see stable demand for this type of product,” Mechel PAO’s Chief Executive Officer Oleg Korzhov commented.

In the CIS, ASC is expected to grow +2.0 to +2.5% (revised up from previous forecast of -0.5% to +0.5%) reflecting stronger economic growth in Russia. In China, ASC growth of +2.5% to +3.5% in 2017 (revised up from previous forecast of -1.0% to 0%), primarily due to strength in real estate and machinery.MoreReplyReplies (12)00SSettyJust when things are looking up.  Mechel ordered to pay 12.7B rub in lawsuit by former partner who intends to sue up to 60B rub.  Mechel is attempting to appeal the ruling.  A person could write a compelling drama series on the ups and downs of Mechel.ReplyReplies (3)10LLadaNivaI'm still surprised at how the Pref. shares lag the Common given the terms of the Pref. guarantee the Pref. dividend can't be less than the dividend on the Common.  Now that MTL is starting to generate positive net income, the Pref. shares will receive dividends while the Common receive nothing for several years until the debt levels are reduced.  By my way of valuation, I'd think the Pref. should be selling at a decent premium to the Common instead of a significant discount.  Preferred ADR's will get about $0.09 per share in mid-August and, by my rough estimates of 2017 earnings, somewhere between $0.20 and $0.25 next year, giving me a current value of at least $1.40-$1.60 ($2.00 or more once we get a couple more quarter's of positive earnings) on the Pref. ADR's, now selling for $1.02.   The risk/reward on the Pref. is a hell of a lot better than on the Common, at least in my humble opinion.MoreReplyReplies (8)10SSettyNearly a $.09 dividend approved for preferred.  Nice little dividend and hopefully just a start.  Next year, we could be looking at a payout 3-4 times higher if good things continue.  I won't hold my breath, but at least this dividend will pay for 3 years of ADR fees, so I will hold my position :)ReplyReplies (7)21IInvestrmanWell, I'd be satisfied seeing that 3.75 area finally traded thru especially on backs of G7 and Poland visit right now, and statements against Russia in general...ReplyReplies (1)12MMAGAthis stock is going nowhere. had agent Orange #$%$ ,it could have been $20-$30 stock. no complaints here.I just sold the last part of my MTL holdings and I will have to pay some hefty tax on this profit. all the money is in AKS.

On the downside,  USA wants to add new sanctions on Russian miners, and there's more steel duty rulings to come.@@@VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - June 15, 2017) - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TECK.A and TECK.B, NYSE: TECK) ("Teck") today provided guidance for expected realized steelmaking coal price and an update on volumes for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter 2017 price for steelmaking coal sold under quarterly contract has been established based on an average of three assessments, which results in pricing of approximately US$190 per tonne. This index pricing mechanism will apply effective April 1, 2017, and for future quarters.Teck now expects its second quarter average realized coal price to be between US$160 and US$165 per tonne. The differential between the quarterly benchmark price and our average realized price for the second quarter is larger than usual. After steel mills filled their prompt requirements immediately following the Queensland cyclone, there were very few prime hard coking coal spot sales during the four week period from mid-April. Steelmaking coal sales volumes for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between 6.8 and 7 million tonnes. Final quarterly sales will depend on timing of shipments.http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/teck-updates-steelmaking-coal-guidance-tsx-teck.a-2222182.htmMoreTeck Updates Steelmaking Coal GuidanceVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - June 15, 2017) - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TECK.A and TECK.B, NYSE: TECK) ("Teck") today provided guidance for expected realized steelmaking coal price and an update on volumes for the second quarter ofwww.marketwired.comReply10LLadaNiva$0.09 Preferred ADR dividend coming in August!  At least it will cover my ADR fees for the last three years!  Now, if we can get two or three more quarters of positive earnings, this baby will really start to move.  If you back out FX gains from 1st Q earnings, we could still see a 2018 dividend of around $0.25-$0.30 per ADR unless Met Coal takes a big dive later this year.  Assuming 2nd Q earnings are in line with 1st Q, the Pref. ADR could easily be in the $2.00-$3.00 range.  Meanwhile, those holding the common will be sucking wind for the next several years until the dividend restrictions are lifted by the creditors which could be a long way off.MoreReplyReplies (7)40LLadaNivaWish this company would provide more transparent disclosures.  Unless I missed something, they have yet to say whether any of the creditor agreements have prohibitions on the company paying Preferred Dividends according to the 20% of net profit terms of the shares.  I'm fairly certain there are dividend restrictions on the common shares but haven't seen anything disclosed about the pref. share dividends.  Likewise, it would have been good to know the specific terms of the Elga sale to Gazprom since the terms themselves have a material impact on the company's valuation.  Guess the lack of transparency is part of the the price we pay to hold the shares but it's frustrating they don't provide basic disclosures about material issues.MoreReplyReplies (5)00IInvestrmanEarnings out. OK but overall revenues below 2016Q4 still.

Now whether we’re going to allocate this to the dividends or not is not yet clear. It depends upon several factors. First of all, it has to be approved by the shareholders meeting. Secondly, we do have other limitations. It is correctly stated in paying dividends under the covenants with the bank, we’re not going to be able to pay that without receiving an approval from the banks.MoreReply10IInvestrmanAnnual Earnings Missed Consensus (Year ending 12/2016)	Next Earnings AnnouncementAnnual Non-GAAP earningsAnnounced April 26, 2017	-$0.76	Annual Consensusof 1 analysts	$0.36	Difference fromconsensus	-147.37%2017 Earningswill announce	(Unconfirmed) July 25, 2017MoreReply03BBoyplunger.comDebbie...

S&P Global Platts assessed Premium Low Vol FOB Australia up $58.50/mt, or 32%, to $241/mt FOB Australia Wednesday, the largest daily rise since the assessment began in 2010, and greater than the $35/mt hike on January 14, 2011, caused by Cyclone Yasi. "The [premium coking coal] market is going berserk," one source said, with "all traditional market players hunting for cargoes." The source said Wednesday evoked memories of Cyclone Yasi in 2011. The source indicated BHP's declaration of force majeure was an important signal and trigger that sent global steelmakers scrambling for non-Queensland met coal supply. This followed force majeures declared by Yancoal, Qcoal and Jellinbah Group. One steelmaker said that while other miners had not publicly declared force majeure, they had already declared it on a "cargo-by-cargo basis." Firm market demand was reflected by the flurry of spot trades for met coal from several swing suppliers -- Canada, the US, Russia and China -- for a wide spectrum of products. The buyer pool also appeared to be diverse, with Northeast Asia, India and Europe all understood to have purchased cargoes. GLOBAL SUPPLY SHORTAGE The wide geographical range of trades points to the global magnitude of the supply shortage faced by the market. This was reflected in bid indications from end-users Wednesday. The highest indicative bid was $240/mt FOB Australia for premium HCCs by a large international steelmaker. Another international steelmaker saw a price range of $200-$250/mt FOB Australia as a bid indication due to a scarcity of resources. Mirroring these bid indications were trades done, or very close to being done. One was for a premium coal of Australian origin re-exported from Chinese ports at $240/mt FOB China. The volume was said to be 60,000 mt. Another was Chinese premium HCC with CSR over 70% at above $260/mt FOB China, for 60,000 mt for an April laycan. "The price is high because there are no coals," a market source said. A steelmaker said: "Some of our shipments have been canceled. The problem [shortage] is real." Other premium HCCs were also traded, with more than two trades of Canadian coal, though all on a floating price basis. In the second-tier segment, there were no trades being done, but a sell-side source indicated he would increase his offer price by $13/mt day on day for non-Australian HCC with 55-60% CSR. There was a spot offer for US coal with 62-63% CSR, 29-30% VM and 0.9% sulfur at $205/mt CFR India. This was for a Panamax cargo for an April 10-20 laycan. In the semi-soft market, a supplier raised his offer by $35/mt day on day to $130/mt for 39-40% VM, 5-6% ash coal, saying inquiries had now risen. "We're expecting some inquiries from China, and there have been ones from India and Japan. There just isn't much coal available," he said. One major Asian steelmaker said he would bid $130/mt for 36-39% CSR, 34-36% VM semisoft coal. The PCI market, in contrast, saw the smallest uptick. A spot trade was done for Russian material with 19-21% VM, below 10% ash, 0.3-0.5% sulfur and around 65-75 HGI at around $125/mt CFR India, for an April 5-15 laycan.MoreReplyReplies (1)30IInvestrmanRight now after what Mr. Putin said last night, siding with Assad, I feel there will be a global boycott against Russian in many ways...I can't believe Putin would support this #$%$ who gasses own people, just to keep business product sales up between the two Nations...ReplyReplies (2)11Show More63,000 people have canceled their Tesla Model 3 ordersBusiness InsiderStart Living The Millionaire LifestyleTorOptionSponsored'Don't put that guy in front of the cameras again': Fox News host unloads on Stephen Miller after altercation with CNN reporterBusiness InsiderYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

CHELYABINSK, Russia, July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mechel PAO (MOEX:MTLR) (NYSE:MTL), a leading Russian mining and metals company, reports that Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant has cast its first oversize 50-tonne ingot. The new technology for production of bulk ingots from specialty steels will enable Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant to enter a new segment of the oversize product market and make supplies both domestically and internationally. Bulk ingots are produced by very few companies globally as their production requires equipment capable of simultaneous casting of necessary volumes of quality steel while maintaining special temperatures and speed in pouring steel into a mould. The mould is also technically difficult to produce, with the plant’s mould developed by the plant’s own experts who managed to attain maximum precision in its making. The plant has produced bulk ingots before, but their maximum weight reached 17.5 tonnes. Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s 50-tonne ingots will be supplied as billets to Mechel’s other steel facility, Urals Stampings Plant. Urals Stampings Plant will use them to produce a new type of product — bulk forgings which are highly in demand in mechanical engineering. “Production of a high-quality 50-tonne ingot is an event of strategic importance for Mechel’s steel division. Today only a few facilities in Russia and abroad can produce such ingots. While streamlining this production process, our experts applied groundbreaking design, engineering and technical solutions. We plan to build on this development, as we see stable demand for this type of product,” Mechel PAO’s Chief Executive Officer Oleg Korzhov commented. Mechel is an international mining and steel company. Its products are marketed in Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa. Mechel unites producers of coal, iron ore concentrate, steel, rolled products, ferroalloys, heat and electric power. All of its enterprises work in a single production chain, from raw materials to high value-added products.

We wish to caution you that these statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We do not intend to update these statements. We refer you to the documents Mechel files from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 20-F. These documents contain and identify important factors, including those contained in the section captioned “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in our Form 20-F, that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements, including, among others, the achievement of anticipated levels of profitability, growth, cost and synergy of our recent acquisitions, the impact of competitive pricing, the ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and licenses, the impact of developments in the Russian economic, political and legal environment, volatility in stock markets or in the price of our shares or ADRs, financial risk management and the impact of general business and global economic conditions.

The new technology for production of bulk ingots from specialty steels will enable Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant to enter a new segment of the oversize product market and make supplies both domestically and internationally.Bulk ingots are produced by very few companies globally as their production requires equipment capable of simultaneous casting of necessary volumes of quality steel while maintaining special temperatures and speed in pouring steel into a mould. The mould is also technically difficult to produce, with the plant’s mould developed by the plant’s own experts who managed to attain maximum precision in its making.The plant has produced bulk ingots before, but their maximum weight reached 17.5 tonnes. Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s 50-tonne ingots will be supplied as billets to Mechel’s other steel facility, Urals Stampings Plant. Urals Stampings Plant will use them to produce a new type of product — bulk forgings which are highly in demand in mechanical engineering.“Production of a high-quality 50-tonne ingot is an event of strategic importance for Mechel’s steel division. Today only a few facilities in Russia and abroad can produce such ingots. While streamlining this production process, our experts applied groundbreaking design, engineering and technical solutions. We plan to build on this development, as we see stable demand for this type of product,” Mechel PAO’s Chief Executive Officer Oleg Korzhov commented.Mechel is an international mining and steel company. Its products are marketed in Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa. Mechel unites producers of coal, iron ore concentrate, steel, rolled products, ferroalloys, heat and electric power. All of its enterprises work in a single production chain, from raw materials to high value-added products.Some of the information in this press release may contain projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Mechel, as defined in the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
