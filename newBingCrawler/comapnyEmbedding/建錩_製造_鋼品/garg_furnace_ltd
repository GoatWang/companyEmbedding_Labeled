            Features:
 
1.S-PH3000A-C can be operated horizontally and vertically, which allows to perform different types of weld (horizontal and vertical joints). The machine is equipped with a control panel, which allows easily and safely setting and performance of the whole welding process.Otherwise according to the user’s needs, it is also possible to input the type of material and the dimension of the thermoplastic sheet, and therefore proceed to weld. Each welding cycle is automatically memorized
 
2. Welding types: horizontal, 90 degrees (on request), S-PH3000A--C is a CNC automatic butt fusion machine, suitable for welding thermoplastic sheets made of HDPE, PP, PVC, PVDF….
 
3.The new steel structure, patented mechanical synchronous drive technology, through the proportional valve, in the weld area to achieve uniform pressure.Control system Siemens PLC, 7-inch color touch screen.
 
4.Data parameters are automatically selected according to the material a particular welding pressure, temperature and time.
 
5.3mm-40mm welding capabilities, special welding thickness of up to 60mm.
 
 Range of Application :
 
Manufacture of reservoirs, tanks and containers, manufacture of plastic apparatus, pipeline construction, ventilation systems, serial welding, water treatment systems, scrubbers, environmental technology, swimming pools, transport and logistics.
