          2017-05-24
        

Llodio, May 24, 2017. Based on a strategy focused upon Premium products, the improvement of the company's sales positioning, and an entrance into new markets, the Tubacex Group has boosted sales of higher added-value products. This has led the company to make progress throughout the second quarter of the year with a backlog for premium product order intake for €700 million - the highest in Tubacex history, with supply taking place over the next three years. 
        



          2017-05-24
        

Llodio, May 24, 2017.  Despite an investment reduction in the exploration and production sector (one of the Group's main activity sectors) for the second year running and associated market uncertainty, TUBACEX has reaffirmed its commitment to Innovation and Diversification as growth levers. At the Annual Shareholders' General Meeting (ASGM) held today at our headquarters in Llodio, the Company's sales evolution was highlighted in a year where record-breaking sale milestones for some products were achieved; and strategic guidelines for the next four years were also defined.
        



          2017-05-04
        

Llodio, May 04, 2017. TUBACEX has kicked off the year with an EBITDA of €13 million, which is up 67.9% on the same period last year, reaching a margin of 10%, according to the results presented today to the CNMV (Spanish Securities Exchange Commission). In a market environment that is still weak, the company has secured a net profit of €2.8 million in the first quarter of the year. Its sales have amounted to €131.3 million, up 8.2% on the first quarter of 2016.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
