In the recent year, the company has rightly recognized the energy security concerns for its ferro alloys’ manufacturing facilities and more importance is being placed on energy independence. To enhance the competitiveness in long run and to arrest the supply side bottleneck of the state grid, the company is setting up a 67.5 MW coal based captive power plant at Jajpur, District Orissa to address the energy needs of its Jajpur Unit. The power plant is expected to be commissioned by 2013-2014.
