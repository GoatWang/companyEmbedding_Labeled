The key factor in success of our business is the acceptance of the concept of readymade steel and getting the contractors/ developers to switch from labour oriented conventional method to ready to use steel in construction. Over the years Indian construction sector has been largely dependent on conventional methods of construction leading to larger gestation period in construction. Since early 1990’s especially after opening up of the economy the need for infrastructure in the country has grown exponentially and with expected high GDP growth, the infrastructure growth is expected to remain strong. The growth of infrastructure sector led to the requirement of faster deliveries and reduction in the construction time to create the infrastructure facilities required by the country especially in the building segment. 

HUMAN RESOURCE   
We seek to retain our talent through better career growth and a competitive level of compensation and a positive working environment.
Mrs. Ritika Jain, Company Secretary & Compliance Officer
Mrs. Ritika Jain is a Fellow Member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of  India. She is having a post qualification experience of more than six years in the Secretarial field. She has done B.Com and LL.B & has joined our Company from 12th April,2016. Prior to the joining of our company, she has worked with a renowned real estate group as a Company Secretary. She possesses technical knowledge of Company Law and Secretarial work and also possess knowledge related to TDS & accounting related matters.  
Mr. Saurabh Jindal, Chief Financial Officer  
Mr. Saurabh Jindal, has been appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company with effect from 12th April 2016. He is responsible for controlling the financial activities of the company. He will ensure that the financial planning is done properly and financial risks are managed effectively. He has done B.com.  He is the young entrepreneur and is the  son of Mr Vijay Kumar Jindal who has been appointed as a managing director of the company. Prior to joining this company, he has worked as a CFO in a renowned real estate company. He is presently director in some renowned real estate companies. He is working as a VP marketing in its promoter/acquiring company SVP Builders (I) Ltd. Through his  financial guidance and new ideas, it is expected that the company will progress a lot. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY 
We are into the business of trading of various products of steel for more than 11 years. We want to leverage our strength to our benefit in future so as to become an effective player in the steel & tube industry. We wish to continue to supply our products to corporate houses, increase our market share in the industry, produce quality products at the competitive rates and adopt one of the best human resource practices 
 Focus on current customers 
We intend to focus on our satisfied customers who understand the advantages of using readymade steel for their requirement. Our main focus will be to cater to their requirements in the northern and central India. We expect to secure significant orders from our current customers in new locations as well.
Create a niche in large size construction projects
 Our strategy is to become a dominant player in tall structures and large size projects which face space and labour constraints on the construction site; and provide them with an efficient and cost effective solution for their requirements of steel in the construction activities
Focus on Quality
Our Company intends to focus on adhering to the quality of the offerings. This is necessary so as to make sure that we maintain the quality standards for our offerings and get repeat orders from our customers. This will also aid us in enhancing our brand value and further increase the business. 
COMPETITION 
Just like any other industry there is competition in our industry also, we mainly compete with other traders of steel products in organized sector on the basis of availability of product, product range, product traits, quality, assortment and other factors based on price, reputation, customer service and customer convenience. To counter further competition, we are proposing expansion of our business activity so as to achieve diverse product portfolio, economies of scale and cost competitiveness.
MARKETING  
 We believe that there is significant emerging demand for the readymade steel products due to projected growth in the infrastructure and construction activities. We market our products by increasing competitiveness in the market, through reduction in the overall cost of production and developing our network. The Construction Steel items are consumed throughout the country, with the quantity depending upon construction activities being taken up in that area. It is always beneficial for the customer to procure from local producers to save on transportation costs and this is also helpful to the producer due to lower cycle time. The products envisaged by us, will generally cater to the three major construction sectors like infrastructure, industrial construction and housing & commercial construction.
Client Servicing 
 Since this concept is relatively new we also provide after sales service to provide comfort to the clients in usage of this concept as well as to derive the optimal value from usage of Readymade steel. We aim to help the client to understand and use the product more effectively. This initiative helps us to avoid resistance to change which is common in case of any new product

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
