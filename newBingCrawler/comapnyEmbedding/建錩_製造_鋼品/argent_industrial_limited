A repeat of the R22.7 million cost to the group from the July labour strike action is therefore not expected in the next three years.Our focus on automation is bearing fruit, as can be seen from increased margins and the reduction of permanent staff from 2 774 to 2 538 people. This excludes the planned staff reduction at Sentech Industries.The key objective of the Board of Directors is to increase the number of exports and offshore operations to further reduce exposure to South Africa?s labour problems and currency fluctuations.29-Oct-2014(Official Notice)Shareholders are referred to the AGM which was held at Argent's office, First Floor, Ridge 63, 8 Sinembe Crescent, La Lucia Ridge Office Estate, Umhlanga on Tuesday 28 October 2014 at 14:00 and are advised that all ordinary and special resolutions proposed in the Notice of Annual General Meeting were passed, other than ordinary resolution 11 relating to the placing of unissued shares under control of the directors, by the requisite number of shareholders present and represented by proxy and being entitled to vote at the AGM.Total shares voted in person or by proxy amounted to 56.53% of total issued share capital, being 54 545 571 shares. 13-Oct-2014(Official Notice)In terms of paragraph 3.4 (b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Ltd., companies are required to publish a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied that there is a reasonable degree of certainty that the financial results for the next reporting period will differ by more than 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.Headline earnings per share for the six months ended 30 September 2014 are expected to be between 27.7 and 31.5 cents per share, which is between 48.8% and 68.8% higher than the 18.7 cents per share reported for the previous corresponding period.Earnings per share for the six months ended 30 September 2014 are expected to be between 25 and 28 cents per share, which is between 74.7% and 94.7% higher than the 14.3 cents per share reported for the previous corresponding period.In addition, the pre-tax results would have increased by a further R24 million had the company not been effected by the 4 week July 2014 industrial strike action.

Dividend An interim gross dividend of 7 cents per share has been declared subsequent to 30 September 2013 for the six months period ending 30 September 2013. Outlook The group is creating its core business around its branded manufacturing companies and will be focusing on the respective market shares and production automation of these operations.

The volatility and devaluation of the Rand / Dollar exchange rate has resulted in foreign exchange losses on imports to the value of R8.3 million. The group has discontinued certain of its automotive product lines which will result in a write down of R19.3 million related stock and the retrenchment of 43 operators at a cost of R0.8 million.

This resulted in retrenchments of 28 people at a cost of R1 million, write down of stock of R2 million and a goodwill impairment of R4.5 million, all of which have been provided for. Should the once-off items incurred during this period as detailed above be excluded, the group?s results would have improved if compared to the previous year for the same period. With this in mind the Board has recommended an interim dividend which will be in line with this improvement.The above information has not been reviewed or reported on by the company?s external auditors. It is anticipated that the results for the six months ended 30 September 2013 are to be published on SENS on or about 26 November 2013.18-Sep-2013(Official Notice)Shareholders were informed of the resignation of Mr Marc Allen as Executive Director with effect from 17 September 2013.28-Aug-2013(Official Notice)In order to restructure the board committees to ensure good corporate governance and in compliance with paragraph 3.59(c) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are hereby informed of the following changes to the board committees of the Company with effect from 28 July 2013:*Teunis Scharrighuisen - Non-executive chairman*Mr. Scharrighuisen has resigned as a member of the Audit and Risk Committee; and*Mr. Scharrighuisen has also resigned as chairman of the Nominations Committee but remains a member thereof.*Clayton Angus - Independent non-executive director*Mr. Angus has resigned as the chairman of the Nominations Committee but remains a member thereof. *Patrick Day -Lead Independent non-executive director*Mr. Day has been appointed the chairman of the Nominations Committee.21-Aug-2013(Official Notice)Shareholders were referred to the AGM which was held at Argent's office, First Floor, Ridge 63, 8 Sinembe Crescent, La Lucia Ridge Office Estate, Umhlanga on Tuesday 20 August 2013 at 14:00 and were advised that, save for Ordinary Resolution 12 (general authority to issue shares for cash), all ordinary and special resolutions proposed in the Notice of Annual General Meeting were passed by the requisite number of shareholders present and represented by proxy and being entitled to vote at the AGM.30-Jul-2013(Official Notice)Shareholders were informed of the appointment of Mr Jaco Dauth as Company Secretary with effect from 1 August 2013.26-Jun-2013(C)Revenue increased to R1.9 billion (2012: R1.8 billion).

Argent has taken this opportunity to reduce inventory levels and trim away inefficiencies in the businesses to ensure a strong and sustained recovery as market conditions continue to improve to any degree. With the reduction in stock levels being evident at the end of October, it is fair to say that Argent has never before been so well positioned and prepared to benefit from an upturn in the South African and international economies. The overall outlook for the group is very positive, particularly now that a more focused strategy for the automotive sector is being implemented. Lagging steel prices remain a concern for Argent and the industry as a whole.

Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders decreased to R1.5 million (September 2008: R95 million). Headline earnings down by 96.9% to R3 million(September 2008: R94.9 million) ,with headline earnings per share down to 3.3cps (September 2008: 106.9cps) DividendDue to the group's performance, the priority is to preserve liquidity and the board has therefore decided not to declare an interim dividend. ProspectsThe global financial crisis took a tremendous toll on Argent's steel and automotive sectors which had a material impact on the group's financial results for the first six months of the financial year. The economy is showing signs of a recovery, and this is reflected in the overall performance of the group improving since June `09. Some of the businesses have shown strong resilience to the downturn in the economy with the likes of Xpanda Security, Cedar Paint, Castor and Ladder and Toolroom Services all performing very well and growing market share in the downturn. Although the automotive sector produced a poor set of results, its market share has grown with a number of competitors exiting the market. Overall Argent has taken this opportunity to reduce stock levels and trim away inefficiencies in the businesses to ensure a strong recovery when the market improves. The investment in new infrastructure in Cape Town and George will increase the market share of all of the group's businesses in these areas, while the introduction of Barrier Angelucci into Argent will open up new markets and clients to the group's offerings. It is fair to say that Argent has never before been so well positioned and prepared to benefit from improved market conditions.09 Oct 2009 13:46:18(Official Notice)Argent advises that it expects the group's headline earnings per share for the half year ended 30 September 2009 to be between 90% and 99% lower compared to the previous corresponding period. This equates to a headline earnings per share of between 11.0 and 1.1 cps, compared to headline earnings of 109.7 cps for the previous corresponding period.   Earnings per share for the half year ended 30 September 2009 are estimated to be between 91% and 100% lower compared to the previous corresponding period. This equates to an earnings per share of between 9.6 and 0.0 cps, compared to earnings of 106.9 cps for the previous corresponding period.   Trading during the period proved to be very difficult as a result of the global economic recession, the worst seen in many years. It is anticipated that the results for the half year ended 30 September 2009 are to be published on or about 25 November 2009.17 Sep 2009 13:27:42(Official Notice)Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting held on Wednesday, 16 September 2009, all the resolutions set out in the notice and proposed at the meeting were passed by the requisite majority of shareholders. The special resolution will be submitted for registration at the companies and intellectual property registration office in due course.29 Jun 2009 11:44:34(C)Revenue increased by 19.5% from R1 635 million to R1 949 million in 2009.Operating profit decreased to R221 297 million (2008:R295 187 million). Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders decreased to R116 973 million (R199 854 million). Headline earnings on a per share basis decreased to 126.80cps (231.0cps). Dividends per shareA final dividend of 9cps was declared for the period under review.ProspectsThe group's strategy for the 2010 financial year is to maintain operational capacity and to increase its geographical footprint, whilst maintaining costs at the same time.  27 May 2009 13:41:43(Official Notice)Argent wishes to advise shareholders that the earnings per share and headline earnings per share for the year ending 31 March 2009 are expected to decrease between 44% and 49% from the corresponding period ending 31 March 2008. The primary reasons for this decrease in earnings per share and headline earnings per share is as a result of the Automotive and Steel Divisions being severely affected by the slowdown in these industries as a result of the global financial crisis. In terms of IAS 2 it has also been necessary to write down the steel inventory as a result of the average price decrease of 55% in the group's steel product range since September 2008. The financial information on which this trading statement has been based has not been reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.04 Mar 2009 14:15:04(Official Notice)Argent advises that Ms Sue Cox will be resigning as Financial Director on 1 April 2009 and will continue with the company as a Director on an operational level. Mrs Jennifer Etchells will be appointed as Financial Director with effect from 1 April 2009.10 Nov 2008 16:55:35(Official Notice) 29 Oct 2008 13:58:43(C)Revenue growth of 23.7% to R1.1 billion (R877.5 million). Operating profit increased by 15.1% to R167 million (R145.1 million) and earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders rose to R95.1 million (R84.4 million). In addition, headline earnings per share up by 9.8% to 106.9cps (97.4cps). DividendAn ordinary interim dividend of 19cps has been declared.ProspectsLooking forward to the second half of the 2009 financial year, it can be assumed that the volatility in key market forces will continue. Argent believes that the vast majority of its businesses have the correct strategies in place to ward off the worst of the effects of this volatility. The companies also have the ability to make proactive and inventive decisions to counter changing market conditions. Argent should achieve positive headline earnings growth and exceed its R2 billion turnover target. The incorporation of the Paint and Ladders business into Argent is expected to continue to have a favourable impact on the 2009 results. An agreement has also been concluded for the acquisition of a company that will open up additional export markets into the UK and Europe with a range of manufactured steel products. Only Competition Commission approval is outstanding.29 Sep 2008 12:55:36(Official Notice)Shareholders are advised that Argent has appointed Investec Bank Ltd as sponsor to the company with effect from 1 October 2008.19 Sep 2008 15:13:44(Official Notice)Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting of Argent held at 14:00 on Tuesday, 16 September 2008, all the ordinary and special resolutions, as proposed in the notice to the AGM, were passed by the requisite majority of shareholders, with the exception of ordinary resolution number three; the authority to issue unissued ordinary shares for cash, which was withdrawn due to the current market conditions. The special resolutions will be lodged for registration with the Registrar of Companies in due course.05 Sep 2008 07:30:47(Official Notice)Shareholders of Argent are referred to the preliminary report published previously, and are advised that the annual financial statements of the company have now been published. Argent shall not be publishing an abridged report, as the information previously published in the preliminary report is unchanged. The AGM of the company shall be held in the boardroom of the company at 1318 Club House Street, Maraisburg, Roodepoort, at 14:00 on Tuesday, 16 September 2008.15 Jul 2008 12:34:35(Media Comment)According to Finweek, there is concern about Argent's latest proposal to bulk up and separately list its cement and quarrying businesses. One market watcher suggested that the group's timing is off as new infrastructure plays have been hammered quite badly over since January 2008.25 Jun 2008 16:10:28(C)Revenue rose to R1.7 billion (R1.3 billion) for the year to 31 March 2008. Operating profit increased by 37.6% to R308.7 million (R224.4 million). Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders R186 million (R138.3 million). Headline earnings per share was up 17.4% to 204.2cps (174cps). DividendsA final ordinary dividend of 19cps has been declared.OutlookLooking forward the 2009 financial year is expected to show substantial growth on these results should the Argent businesses maintain their current performance. Further, the steel trading division is expected to more than make up for a drop in performance of the home and office businesses in both sales and margins for 2009. The group will comfortably turn R2 billion in 2009, one year ahead of projections. Growth in the mining and construction sectors in Southern Africa is expected to ensure continued high levels of demand for the steel trading and fabrications businesses. Profits on inventories due to increased steel prices are expected to be significant. Steel price increases from January to March 2007 were 21%; while price increases post March to date has been 47%. Additional steel price increases are on the cards for this year based on projections by ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd and international trends, taking into account the weaker Rand. Growth in Megamix is also expected to be above average due to the infrastructure spend and the harbour development in Cape Town. The manufacturing businesses are expected to benefit from the higher steel prices and make better profits, while sales are expected to drop off slightly. The incorporation of the Paint and Ladder business into Argent will further boost the 2009 results. Current investigations into new acquisitions include a business that could open up export markets into the UK and Europe with a steel manufactured range of products. Also, an opportunity exists to acquire a business manufacturing moulded concrete products that will develop vertical integration synergies for Megamix and Villiersdorp Quarries, and puts Argent closer to achieving a separate listing for this group of businesses. Overall we believe that Argent's proactive and quick response to market conditions will ensure that we will perform well even in these trying times. This environment has historically been very conducive to making valuable acquisitions at fair market values.31 Mar 2008 18:50:36(Official Notice)Shareholders and interested parties are kindly requested to ignore the previous directors dealings announcement released this afternoon, as it was a duplication released in error - the announcement was in fact made in January 2008 when SJ Cox traded.

ProspectsThe group has very little information to hand that suggests that any of its companies will not achieve increased turnover and profit levels for the 2007 financial year. The group successfully attained its short-term goal of R1 billion turnover for the 2006 financial year. Argent will now attempt to double its 2006 turnover by the 2009 financial year.07 Apr 2006 16:25:32(Official Notice)Nesta Glover has resigned as the company secretary of Argent with effect from 1 April 2006.

There are no indicators, economic or otherwise, to suggest that this will not be the case. The group is confident that it will maintain an overall growth in headline earnings per share of around 20% for the full financial year.  Dividend                     An interim dividend of 13 cents per share has been declared, subsequent to 30 September 2005, payable on Monday 23 January 2006.

The financial information on which this trading statement has been based has not been reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.30 Sep 2005 16:40:51(Official Notice)At the general meeting of Argent shareholders held on 24 August 2005, shareholder approval was obtained to change the company"s auditors from BDO Spencer Stewart (KZN) Inc. to Siyabala Inc. due to the dissolution of the previous auditor partnership. The change in auditors comes into effect immediately.25 Aug 2005 16:33:04(Official Notice)At the general meeting of Argent shareholders held on Wednesday, 24 August 2005, all the ordinary resolutions proposed were passed by the requisite majority of shareholders.30 Jun 2005 15:52:37(Official Notice)Argent has appointed Fred Litschka  and Marc Allen as executive directors of the company with immediate effect.  Mr Litschka formerly served as a non-executive director of the company and  joined the group as a permanent member of staff on 1 June 2005, whilst Mr Allen  formerly served as an alternate director.14 Jun 2005 12:21:07(C)Revenue increased by 24.3% to R752mn (R605m). Attributable earnings increased by 35.4% to R83m (R61.3m). Headline earnings per share increased by 19.2% to 126.6c (106.2c). A final dividend of 12c per share has been declared, payable on Monday 11 July 2005 to shareholders recorded in the register at close of business on Friday 8 July 2005, being the record date in order to participate in such a dividend.

However, at the same time plans have been implemented to drive the group towards its short-term goal of R1bn in annual turnover. The purchase of Xpanda Security will ensure greater visibility for the group in terms of a recognised brand, increase the volume of steel traded through the group, result in synergies and cost savings in areas where the group has existing operations and allow the group to tap into the lucrative and growing South African security market.                              The purchase of and/or extensions to properties in respect of the Phoenix steel operations in Durban, Middelburg, Port Elizabeth and Germiston will increase the group`s Steel trading and processing capacity. State of the art machinery acquisitions such as the new tube mill for Phoenix Steel - Gauteng, the high definition plasma machine for Phoenix Steel Mpumalanga as well as the funds being spent at Giflo, Xpanda and Megamix will further enhance the group`s ability to produce quality products for its customers. New products and product ranges, especially in terms of Jetmaster`s barbeques, Excalibur`s after market stainless steel ranges and automotive plastic components and Giflo`s Toyota project will serve to further widen the group`s product base.  The recent weakening of the rand shows signs of being sustainable to some degree. This will have a substantial effect on the group`s export margins and will also have a positive effect on a wide range of the group`s customer base.  30-Oct-2014(X)Argent Industrial Ltd. is largely a steel-based beneficiation group with a very diverse portfolio of businesses that include international brands.
