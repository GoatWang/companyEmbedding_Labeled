Synalloy Corporation Closes on the Purchase of Marcegaglia USA's Stainless Steel Pipe and Tube Operations

RICHMOND, Va., March  01, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Synalloy Corporation (Nasdaq:SYNL) today announced that its subsidiary Bristol Metals, LLC, has closed on the purchase of Marcegaglia USA's stainless steel pipe and tube operations.  The purchase price for the transaction of $14.95 million includes primarily the stainless steel pipe and tube manufacturing equipment and inventory assets of the business.  The combined business will operate as Bristol Metals, LLC, with facilities in Bristol, TN and Munhall, PA.  The new Bristol Metals, LLC will be the largest domestic producer of welded stainless steel pipe and mechanical tube in North America, with market share approaching 40%.  Craig Bram, President and CEO of Synalloy Corporation noted, "The combined capacity of the two operations will exceed 70 million pounds annually across all product lines.  At 2014 pricing and demand levels, the new Bristol Metals, LLC has the potential to generate in excess of $150 million in annual revenue." Kyle Pennington, President of Synalloy Metals said, "We will spend the balance of 2017 integrating the sales and operations of the two companies and expect a smooth transition.  Best practices and procedures will be adopted from both operations to ensure the highest in product quality and service to our customers.   The acquisition of Marcegaglia USA's laser and TIG mills enhances our on-going business with additional capacity and technological advantages.  Bristol Metals, LLC will have the most extensive product line and capacity in the industry.  We can now offer a full range of tubing products to support our new heavy wall capabilities and traditional welded pipe markets.  We are well positioned compared to other competitors supplying our markets."

Synalloy Announces Ownership Position in Universal Stainless

RICHMOND, Va., June  29, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Synalloy Corporation (Nasdaq:SYNL) ("Synalloy") has acquired a 3% ownership position in Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. (Nasdaq:USAP) ("Universal Stainless") and has presented the Universal Stainless Board of Directors with an initial proposal to merge the two companies.  Craig Bram, President and CEO of Synalloy Corporation, said, "We believe that a combination of Synalloy and Universal Stainless offers immediate as well as future value to both shareholder groups.  Product lines, distribution channels, end markets served and geographic proximity of manufacturing facilities provide opportunities for cost savings and new business development.  Additionally, the elimination of duplicative corporate overhead and related public company costs is estimated at $3 million annually."  Bram shared, "In a normalized demand market, the combined company would have annual revenue and EBITDA of $475 million and $60 million, respectively.  The balance sheet would be substantially larger, providing the resources to more aggressively pursue a growth by acquisition strategy.  The market cap of the merged entity would easily place the company in the Russell 2000, providing the potential for additional share price appreciation and greater liquidity for shareholders.  Ultimately, the Metals segment of the combined company could be a leading supplier of specialty steel products with an emphasis on stainless steel, nickel alloys and other premium alloy products, serving every major end market in the industrial economy." The Universal Stainless Board of Directors responded to the Synalloy merger proposal by stating that pursuit of a business combination with Synalloy was not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.  The reasons given, in part, were as follows:  1) the exchange ratio proposed by Synalloy did not adequately recognize what the Universal Stainless Board believes to be Universal Stainless' disproportionately undervalued share price; 2) the existence and value of potential synergies between the two companies has been overstated; and 3) the use of a sale-leaseback in the transaction is unacceptable to the Universal Stainless Board of Directors.  Bram said, "Synalloy is open to discussing the exchange ratio, but we are confident that the synergies that can be realized from a merger go well beyond the elimination of duplicative corporate overhead.  As to the comments on the sale-leaseback, we believe there are more effective uses of capital than owning manufacturing real estate.  Our proposal would have Universal Stainless shareholders receiving a cash payment equal to about 60% of the sale-leaseback proceeds, with the balance used to retire debt."     Bram further commented, "Synalloy and Universal Stainless have many of the same institutional shareholders. Based on public filings, approximately 24% of each company's shares is owned by the same institutional shareholders.  In addition to Synalloy's 3% ownership, based on public filings, the four largest shareholders of Universal Stainless own 33% of Universal Stainless, but to our knowledge have no overlapping ownership with Synalloy."        Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. This communication relates to a proposal which Synalloy Corporation ("Synalloy") has made for a business combination transaction with Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. ("Universal Stainless"). In furtherance of this proposal and subject to future developments, Synalloy (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, Universal Stainless) may file one or more registration statements, proxy statements, tender offer statements or other documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, registration statement, tender offer statement, prospectus or other document Synalloy and/or Universal Stainless may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of Synalloy and Universal Stainless are urged to read the proxy statement(s), registration statement, tender offer statement, prospectus and other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) or prospectus(es) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of Universal Stainless and/or Synalloy, as applicable. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Synalloy through the web site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Synalloy and/or Universal Stainless and their respective directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed transaction. You can find information about Synalloy's executive officers and directors in Synalloy's definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 4, 2017. You can find information about Universal Stainless' executive officers and directors in Universal Stainless' definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 13, 2017.

Posted on May 9, 2017May 11, 2017 by Kelly PetersCase Study – Synalloy Corporation 

Each business has their own, unique challenges. For Synalloy Corporation, their aggressive growth rate, various business units, and requirements as a publically traded company made it difficult to manage operations and aid in acquisitions. It was clear that they needed a new ERP solution that would centralize their business. Here’s their ERP story…
THE COMPANY
Synalloy Corporation (SYNL) has a rich history supplying its customers with quality products and services in the metals and specialty chemicals industries. Headquartered in Richmond, VA, Synalloy has been in business since 1945 with over 450 employees with operations in Tennessee, Georgia, Texas, and South Carolina.
With an annual revenue of $138.6 million, Synalloy’s business strategy is focused on both organic growth and growth through acquisitions. The holding company consists of five business units: CRI Tolling LLC, Palmer of Texas Tanks Inc., Manufacturers Chemicals LLC, Bristol Metals LLC, and Specialty Pipe & Tube Inc.
THE ERP REQUIREMENTS
In 2008, Synalloy Corporation identified the need for a more flexible and agile ERP framework. In the past, the company used a mix of ERP systems leading to a complex and expensive IT and business framework. “We required an ERP system that would help us manage operations and aid in acquisitions,” said Mike Padden, Corporate Director of IT at Synalloy Corporation.
Since the company relies on a shared services model and aggressively targets other firms for acquisitions, its requirements were quite complex. “We have very different types of businesses with different needs but we require a standardized set of processes,” Padden explained.
Some unique business requirements of their new ERP solution included consolidated accounting for all business unites, SOX compliance, multiple production processes, and customer credit management.
THE DEACOM STORY
Synalloy Corporation selected DEACOM ERP in August 2013 and went live on the software just seven months later. Since then, the company has successfully migrated all its business units onto the platform and continues to do so with each new acquisition.
With the single-system ERP solution in place, the entire business is able to experience a more streamlined environment offering greater visibility into all aspects of the operations and between the various business units.
Through product enhancements, Deacom created native solutions to address Synalloy’s unique business requirements. This creates an inherently simpler approach to product development and user adoption. “Any changes to our system is part of the core code, and there’s no longer a need to update systems manually, including following upgrades,” continued Padden.
THE INFRASTRUCTURE
By running DEACOM ERP on virtual private servers, Synalloy has gained greater flexibility, particularly when changes and updates are necessary. This also enables the company to add server capacity or disk space in a matter of days or even hours, rather than weeks.
