Acid Manager SA70
 
Scanacon’s flagship bench-top analyser, the SA70 builds upon the basic AT75s/AT75 by incorporating automatic density determination, sophisticated software with statistical process control (SPC) functionality, and the capability to track up to 21 individual acid processes. 
 
The SA70 Acid Manager is a semi-automatic bench-top analysis system that allows for a quick and accurate analysis of free acid and dissolved metals. The concentration of any mixed acid solution of H2SO4, HCl or HNO3 in conjunction with HF, and the total concentration dissolved metal ions can be determined in less than two minutes, and reported as either g/L, wt% or molar.
 
Powerful Statistical Process Control (SPC) software allows the SA70 to track up to 21 individual acid recipes while the softwares automatic control chart plotting allows operations to quickly access the current state of the process. When actions are necessary to bring the process into the control range, the SA70 software automatically calculates the required raw acid dosage, water addition or dump volume. Built in OPC server software can transmit data to a PC or PLC for automatic process control - i.e the Scanacon Continuous Acid Dosing (CADOS) system.
 
Adding to the SA70 functionality, all analytical results, including calibrations, check standards and samples are logged in a historical database, and may be reviewed at any time, plotted on control charts or exported as raw data. The historical database, combined with the SPC software allows operations to quickly access and address variations in the acid process, or, alternatively, offers the assurance the acid process was in compliance if variations in quality control (QC) occur.
 
Like the AT75s and AT75, the SA70 analytical method is based on density and specially designed ion-selective electrodes.
 
An automatic density meter (densitometer) is used to take the reading of the sample density. In addition, the densitometer also functions to dilute and cool the sample in preparation for the ion analysis.
 
Three electrodes - two Ion-selective for H+, F- and one reference electrode are used. The potential difference measured between the ion selective electrode and the reference is used to determine the specific ion activity. To compensate for temperature dependence in ion activity, a thermocouple measures the temperature in the sample during the test.
 
Concentrations of free acid are calculated as a function of ion activity. Total metals are calculated as a function of free acid concentration and density.
 
Calibration of the SA70 is by ISO certified solutions, and is accomplished quickly and easily. The SA70 user-interface automatically prompts the operator through the calibration procedure, and verifies the result.
 
Based on user defined process parameters of acid concentration, metal concentration and process volume, the SA70 software calculates the necessary raw acid addition required to maintain the process at the target concentrations. The SA70 can track and control up to 21 unique acid processes.

POSCO-Thainox PCL
Rayong, Thailand
 
The Background
 
POSCO-Thainox Public Company Limited (POSCO-Thainox), Thailand’s only manufacturer and distributor of premium cold-rolled stainless steel sheets and coils, was founded on 30 July 1990 as a joint venture between world leading steel industry groups from France (Arcelor), Japan (Nippon Steel), and Thai investors. On 20 September 2011, POSCO, Global Steel and Stainless Steel Maker acquired Thainox.
 
POSCO-Thainox’s manufacturing facility is the first and the most advanced of its kind in the entire ASEAN region.
 
Currently, POSCO-Thainox possesses an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons To better serve the company’s existing customer base as well as support its growth and rising demands for stainless steel consumption, a capacity increase to 300,000 tons is planned.
 
POSCO-Thainox supplies 60% of its premium-quality stainless steel products for applications in various industries domestically, and exports 40% of its output to more than 30 countries across the globe through strong networks. Since its establishment, POSCO-Thainox has increased its domestic and global market share at an annual compounded growth rate of 20%.
 
The Challenge
 
As POSCO-Thainox annual production increased, so too did acid consumption, waste water generation and other environmental liabilities. Given these challenges, POSCO-Thainox sought technology that could reduce H2SO4 and HNO3-HF pickling acid consumption, the environmental impact of NOX emissions, waste water generation, and waste sludge, as well as improve production availability of the annealing and pickling lines. Improved surface quality of the finished product was also an important consideration.
 
 
The Scanacon Solution
 
Scanacon has been instrumental in achieving POSCO-Thainox goals, supplying various pieces of acid management equipment. Initially, Scanacon supplied a SA70 Acid Manager, Acid Recovery, Filtration and Acid Circulation on the Cold Rolled Annealing & Pickling Line (CAPL). When the Hot Rolled Annealing & Pickling Line (HAPL) was installed, the same acid management technologies from Scanacon were included from the design stage.
 
The Result
 
More than 35% HF and 40% HNO3 are saved annually, and NOx emission is kept under the control limit without any “Denox” unit required. A waste-sludge landfill reduction of 50% as been achieved. Importantly, with Scanacon, finishing process control, line uptime, productivity and quality is continually ensured.
 
Scope of Work
 
Scanacon supplied a complete acid management solution to POSCO-Thainox, including:
 
• Engineering
• SA70 Acid Manager
• SA100 Automatic Acid Analyzer
• CycloSAFU
• SAR ModuFlex
• Commissoning
• Training

POSCO Acquires Stake in ThainoxHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0POSCO Acquires Stake in Thainox Zacks Equity Research ZacksJuly 12, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareKorean steelmaker, POSCO (NYSE:PKX - News) recently announced it will acquire a stake in Southeast Asia's largest stainless steel producer Thainox Stainless Pcl. for KRW305.9 billion or $287 million.The company currently owns a 15.39% stake in the target company. POSCO will also obtain the additional stake of Mahagitsiri family for 2.20 baht per share.POSCO proposes to buy the remaining stake between September and October in 2011.However, Posco would terminate the tender if it is unable to get at least 51% stake of the target company.Thainox has an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of cold-rolled stainless steel which is going up to 300,000 tons, as it plans to provide better assistance to its existing customers and satisfy the rising demands for stainless steel consumption.With this acquisition, Posco will increase its presence in the Southeast Asian market and improve global competitiveness in the stainless business.The company has been eyeing Thainox for a long time, but could not proceed due to political issues in Thailand.POSCO is the world’s third largest steelmaker on the basis of output. The company primarily manufactures steel for the shipping and construction industries and operates through its two steel production facilities, the Pohang Works and the Gwangyang Works.The company is well positioned to benefit from a wide regional diversification and higher proportion of value-added products in its product mix over the longer term.We currently have a long-term Neutral recommendation on POSCO.However, in the short term we have a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell rating) as the rising competition and higher raw material costs are expected to aggravate price competition and impact margins and revenues.
