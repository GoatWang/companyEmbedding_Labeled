MAGFIT Technologies


MAGFIT - New Generation Magnetic Attachment
MAGFIT magnetic attachments employ several innovative core technologies developed by Aichi Steel Corporation for the Toyota Group.  We are a leader in magnetic materials technology which not only allows for the continued advancement of magnetic attachments but for the research and development of new applications of magnetics in the dental field.
1Strongest Retention in its class with an ultra-compact size
The attractive force performance properties of MAGFIT have been improved 10 times over conventional agnets. This has been achieved with Aichi Steel's cutting edge technology in magnetic circuit design optimization.
2No Corrosion
Aichi Steel's precision micro-laser welding technology nables a perfect hermetic seal of the stainless steel outer casing which protects the magnet from corrosion in the oral environment.
3New Magnetic Materials Technology
The success of MAGFIT was also built upon the development of AUM20, Aichi Steel's proprietary soft magnetic stainless steel developed for the dental field (Patent No. JP26227026), which has superior magnetic properties and corrosion resistance, and the use of the world's strongest NdFeB magnet.Closed circuit design assures the patients' safety without harmful bio-magnetic effects.

1.4 million sets of MAGFIT sold over the last decade
First introduced in 1992, MAGFIT has been applied to over 700,000 patients who have enjoyed the merits and convenience of a magnetically retained overdenture.MAGFIT is available in 15 countries worldwide.
Magnet-retained implant supported overdentures
With the increasing number of the clinical application of implants, magnet-retained implant supported overdentures are highly anticipated for edentulous patients. MAGFIT IP magnetic attachments are compatible with major implant systems making it possible to apply this practical treatment.
Product Quality Assurance
All MAGFIT products are CE approved and manufactured in Japan with ISO9001/ISO13485 certification.  Controlled lot numbers are laser-etched on all MAGFIT magnetic assemblies for traceability.  The MAGFIT Service Network has been set up to provide fast and reliable service to all of our MAGFIT customers.

 Magfine Powders from Aichi Steel Corporation.  


 MAGFINE is a NdFeB anisotropic bonded magnet which has the world's highest energy product for a bonded magnet, and a high heat resistance of up to 150°C.
 
The NdFeB magnet, which was discovered in 1982, is produced as a sintered magnet by many manufacturers worldwide, and as an isotropic powder for bonded magnets, originally by Magnequench. Ever
since those early years, an anisotropic bonded magnet with a much higher energy product had been desired, to fill the performance range between these two classes of material, and to enable a more
efficient use of expensive raw materials.
 
Aichi Steel discovered and refined the only commercial production technology for anisotropic magnet powder, which is called "d-HDDR treatment" and succeeded in the mass production of anisotropic
powders for bonded magnets, as well as the techniques for manufacturing high performance magnets.
The name "MAGFINE" (MF) is derived from the combination of 'MAGnet' and the 'FINE' micro-structure of our d-HDDR magnet powder.
