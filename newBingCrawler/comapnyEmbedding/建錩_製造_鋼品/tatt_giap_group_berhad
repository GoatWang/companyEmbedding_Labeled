Tatt Giap Group Berhad-Corporate Info(Group Overview)

















 
 
 
 


 



	   GROUP 
	OVERVIEW
 


 
 
 
 


 
 

		TATT GIAP GROUP BERHAD started with the inception of Tatt Giap 
		Hardware Sdn. Bhd. in 1978. In view of Malaysia’s increasing steel 
		consumption, the group have gradually expanded, diversified and 
		transformed from a trading company into a manufacturing group.

Tatt Giap Steel Centre Sdn. Bhd. was incorporated 
		in 1994 as a steel processing centre to provide JIT services to 
		customers. In 1997, TATT GIAP GROUP BERHAD achieved a major milestone by 
		collaborating with Nippon Metal Industry (NTK), a leading manufacturer 
		of stainless steel coils in Japan, to form Nippon Metal Services (M) Sdn. 
		Bhd. to undertake stainless steel surface polishing and treatment 
		activities.

        The Group’s activities were further enhanced by the incorporation of 2 
		more subsidiaries in 1997, namely Tatt Giap Perforated Metals Sdn. Bhd. 
		and TGMI Industries Sdn. Bhd. undertaking the manufacturing and trading 
		of stainless/steel perforated metals. On the back of its experience, 
		resources and network built up in the steel industry, in 2005, the Group 
		diversified downstream into the manufacturing of stainless steel tubes 
		and pipes under the brand of Superinox with the set up of Superinox Pipe 
		Industry Sdn. Bhd. Superinox Pipes has placed itself as one of the 
		leading manufacturers of Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Pipes in 
		South East Asia.

        In 2007, the Group constantly seek to strategically expand its value 
		chain to offer broader range of product and services by acquiring a full 
		set of manufacturing facilities for the manufacturing of carbon and 
		stainless steel bars through TG Oriental Steel Sdn. Bhd.

        In 2007, TATT GIAP GROUP BERHAD has marked its largest milestone since 
		its inception with the investment of about RM100 million through the 
		incorporation of E-Galv Steel Industry Sdn. Bhd. E-Galv Steel Industry 
		Sdn. Bhd. has completed the setting up of its Electro Galvanizing Line 
		(EGL) and has commenced its commercial production of EG steel coils on 
		2nd February 2009.

        Upon establishing a joint venture partnership with Nippon Steel 
		Corporation and Hanwa Company Limited in Feb 2010, it is now rename to 
		Nippon EGalv Steel Sdn. Bhd.

        TATT GIAP GROUP’s range of products are supplied to various industrial 
		and building sectors in Malaysia and have expanded its market to 
		overseas by exporting to ASEAN countries, India, Australia, United 
		States and Middle East and the Group are now looking into the 
		opportunities to explore into South Africa and South America markets. 
		TATT GIAP GROUP BERHAD currently operates from seven facilities in 
		Penang, Selangor and Johor.

The most recent expansion undertaken by TATT 
		GIAP GROUP BERHAD is in the investment of RM25 million into a new Welded 
		Stainless Steel Pipe Line under Superinox. The new pipe line will be 
		able to produce pipes of larger diameters of 10” to 16” and is the 
		group’s strategic step towards expanding its pipes product range. The 
		production of new pipe line should be commence in April 2010. With this 
		additional investment the total investment in its Superinox pipe lines 
		will reach about RM50 million and Superinox will ultimately be the 
		largest pipe producer in Malaysia in terms of sizes.
