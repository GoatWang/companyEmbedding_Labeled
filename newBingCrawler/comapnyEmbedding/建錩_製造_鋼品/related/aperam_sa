Luxembourg,
July 27, 2017 
-
ArcelorMittal (referred to as “ArcelorMittal” or the “Company”) (MT (New York, Amsterdam,
Paris, Luxembourg), MTS (Madrid)), the world’s leading integrated steel and
mining company, today announced results[1]
for the three month and six month periods
ended June 30, 2017.


Highlights:



    Health
    and safety: LTIF rate of 0.72x in 2Q 2017; 1H 2017 LTIF of 0.78x stable YoY
Operating
    income of $1.4 billion in 2Q 2017; 1H 2017 operating income of
    $3.0 billion, 38.1% higher YoY
 EBITDA
    of $2.1 billion in 2Q 2017; 1H 2017 EBITDA of $4.3 billion, 61% higher YoY
Net
    income of $1.3 billion in 2Q 2017; 1H 2017 net income of $2.3 billion as
    compared to $696 million in 1H 2016
Steel
    shipments of 21.5 Mt in 2Q 2017, up 2% vs. 1Q 2017; 1H 2017 steel shipments of 42.5Mt,
    down 2.4% YoY. Steel shipments down 1.2% on a comparable basis 
 2Q
    2017 iron ore shipments of 15.2Mt (-0.9% YoY), of which 9.5 Mt shipped at
    market prices (-1.2% YoY); 1H 2017 market price iron ore shipments at 18.1Mt;
    up 4.3% YoY
Net
    debt decreased to $11.9 billion as of June 30, 2017, as compared to $12.1
    billion as of March 31, 2017 due to positive free cash flow[2] (+$0.6
    billion) (despite investment in working capital) offset in part by foreign
    exchange losses (-$0.4 billion)



Key strategic developments:



    Advancing
    our leadership position:
    
ArcelorMittal
        launched two new advanced high strength steel products Usibor® 2000 and
        Ductibor® 1000 to the market, furthering our industry leading offering to
        automotive customers; in addition, the new Jet Vapor Deposition line at Liege
        highlights ArcelorMittal’s technology leadership
Action
        2020 progress ongoing: Transformation program in Europe progressing well; we
        are now operating from a more efficient, resized footprint and utilising
        enhanced digitalization of operations to drive productivity improvements and
        support maintenance excellence



    Investing
    with focus and discipline:
    
ArcelorMittal
        selected to become the new owner of Ilva, a significant opportunity to create
        value for our shareholders by leveraging ArcelorMittal’s strengths to realise Ilva’s
        potential as a Tier 1 supplier to European and Italian steel customers.
        Additionally, ArcelorMittal Brasil S.A. announced the acquisition of Votorantim
        S.A. long steel businesses in Brazil[3] to
        strengthen the Company’s long product capability and product leadership


 Strategic
    investments completed in line with the continuous shift towards higher added
    value products:
    
Completed
        slab yard expansion project at Calvert (US), and Galvaline investment at
        Dofasco (Canada), increasing our galvanised sheet capability; and commissioned
        the ArcelorMittal Krakow (Poland) hot rolling mill extension for increased HRC
        and HDG capacity 


 Balance
    sheet progress:
    
 Net
        debt was lower by $0.8 billion YoY despite a $2.8 billion investment in working
        capital over the last 12 months reflecting improved market conditions;
S&P
        and Moody’s credit rating upgrades reflecting ongoing progress towards
        achieving our financial priority of an investment grade credit rating





Outlook:


Looking to the outlook, current
market conditions are improved compared to twelve months ago with steel spreads
currently at healthy levels. The demand environment is positive, as evidenced
by the highest readings from the ArcelorMittal weighted PMI Index since April
2011, which suggests that steel shipments in 2H 2017 will be higher than would
normally be suggested by seasonality alone.


The Company now expects that the cash needs
of the business (excluding working capital and premiums paid to retire debt
early of $0.2 billion (not included in previous guidance)) in 2017
to be approximately $4.6 billion (as compared to $5.0 billion previous
guidance). Given the liability management exercise and lower average debt, we now
expect interest expense to decline to $0.8 billion in 2017 (as compared to $0.9
billion from previous guidance and $1.1 billion in FY 2016).
While capex expectation for 2017 remains at $2.9 billion (from $2.4 billion in
2016), the Company expects lower cash taxes and contributions to fund pensions and
other cash expenses to be lower than previous guidance. 

Given the improved market conditions, the
Company now expects a full year 2017 investment in working capital of
approximately $1.5 billion (as compared to previous guidance of approximately
$1.0 billion).

Commenting, Mr.
Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:


"We have materially improved our
financial performance in the first half of 2017, and continue to make important
progress on our Action 2020 plan. The recently announced acquisition
of Ilva represents a unique opportunity to create value for our
shareholders. Looking ahead demand remains strong in our core markets
supporting robust order books and healthy levels of steel spreads.
However, it remains a matter of concern that we are not able to capture
the full benefits of this demand growth due to continued high levels of
imports. We continue to work towards achieving a comprehensive trade solution
in response to unfair imports."

Key
corporate responsibility highlights for 2Q 2017:


 Annual
    Review, Sustainable Progress, published in May 2017 as the group’s second step
    towards integrated reporting. 
 Launched
    2nd generation of our iCARe® electrical steels in June 2017. iCARe® offers more
    power and driving range for electric motors.
 On
    top of the relining of blast furnace no. 5 and modernization of the basic
    oxygen furnace already completed in Krakow, Poland, the capacity expansion of
    the hot rolling mill and a new galvanizing line have been commissioned in 2Q 2017.
    Together, these investments exceed €120 million and not only will they extend
    the life of the blast furnace for the next 20 years, preserving jobs in the
    Krakow unit and numerous related industries, but they will also ensure the
    Krakow site complies with EU air emission regulations which come into force in
    autumn 2018.
On
    June 27, 2017, ArcelorMittal filed its 2016 report on Payments to Governments
    in respect of Extractive Activities, which provides a consolidated overview of
    payments made by the Company and its subsidiaries in 2016 to governments
    regarding its mining operations. The report, which complies with new reporting
    requirements under Luxembourg law, is available for download from
    corporate.arcelormittal.com within the 'Investors' section.





Analysis of results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 versus
results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 


Total steel shipments
for 1H 2017 were 42.5 million metric tonnes. On
a
comparable basis, excluding shipments from assets sold subsequent to the
comparable period (i.e. sale of long steel producing subsidiaries in the US
(LaPlace and Vinton) and Zaragoza in Spain), and excluding the impact of the
optimization at Zumarraga in Spain (Europe segment) total steel shipments in 1H
2017 declined 1.2% as compared to 1H 2016.


Sales
for 1H 2017 increased by 18.4% to $33.3 billion as compared with $28.1 billion
for 1H 2016, primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+23.1%), and
higher seaborne iron ore reference prices (+43%).

Depreciation of $1.3 billion for 1H 2017
was stable as compared to 1H 2016.
FY 2017 depreciation is expected to be
approximately $2.8 billion. 

Impairment
charges for 1H 2017 were $46 million related to a downward revision of cash
flow projections in South Africa
as compared to impairment charges for 1H 2016
of $49 million related to the sale of ArcelorMittal Zaragoza in Spain.

Exceptional
income for 1H 2016 was $832 million relating to a one-time gain on employee
benefits following the signing of the US labour contract[5].

Operating
income for 1H 2017 was $3.0 billion as compared to $2.1 billion in 1H 2016. Operating results for
1H 2016 were positively impacted by exceptional income as discussed above.

Income
from investments in associates, joint ventures and other investments in 1H 2017
was $206 million as compared to $492 million in 1H 2016. Income from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other investments in 1H 2017
included improved performance of Calvert and Chinese investees, offset in part
by a loss on dilution of the Company’s stake in China Oriental[6]. Income from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other investments for 1H 2016
included $329 million related to gain on disposal of Gestamp[7]. Income from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other investments in 1H 2016 and
1H 2017 includes the annual dividend received from Erdemir of $44 million, and
$45 million, respectively.

Net
interest expense (including interest expense and interest income) was lower at
$430 million in 1H 2017, as compared to $638 million in 1H 2016, driven by debt
reduction including early bond repayments and repayment at maturity on bonds.
The Company now expects full year 2017 net interest expense of approximately
$0.8 billion (reduced from previous guidance of $0.9 billion).


Foreign
exchange and other net financing gains were $77 million for 1H 2017 as compared
to foreign exchange and other net financing costs of $441 million for 1H 2016.
Foreign exchange and other net financing gains for 1H 2017 include foreign
exchange gains of $282 million as compared to a foreign exchange gain of $60
million in 1H 2016, mainly on account of USD depreciation of 8.3% against the
Euro (versus 2% depreciation in prior period).
1H
2017 includes
non-cash mark-to-market gains on derivatives (primarily mandatory convertible
bonds call options following the market price increase in the underlying shares) totalling $0.3
billion in 1H 2017 as compared to $0.1 billion in 1H 2016. The foreign exchange
gain in 1H 2017 is largely non-cash and primarily relates to the gain from the
impact of the USD movements on Euro denominated deferred tax assets, partially
offset by foreign exchange losses on euro denominated debt. Foreign exchange
and other net financing gains/costs for 1H 2017 and 1H 2016 also includes $159
million and $237 million premium expense on the early redemption of bonds. 

ArcelorMittal recorded an income tax
expense of $480 million for 1H 2017 as compared to an income tax expense of $853
million for 1H 2016. The tax expense in 1H 2016 includes derecognition of
deferred tax assets (DTA) amounting to $0.7 billion in Luxembourg. This
derecognition is related to revised expectations of DTA recoverability in US
dollar terms, and is not related to a deterioration of expected future taxable
income.


ArcelorMittal’s
net income for 1H 2017 was $2.3 billion, or $2.28 earnings per share[4], as compared to net
income in 1H 2016 of $0.7 billion, or $0.88 earnings per share[4].



Analysis of results for 2Q 2017 versus 1Q
2017 and 2Q 2016 

Total
steel shipments in 2Q 2017
were 2% higher at 21.5 million metric
tonnes as compared with 21.1 million metric tonnes for 1Q 2017 primarily due to
improved shipments in Brazil (+17.8%), Europe (+2.5%), ACIS (+1.1%), offset in
part by lower shipments in NAFTA (-3.4%). 
On a
comparable basis, excluding shipments from assets sold subsequent to the
comparable period (i.e.
considering the sale of Zaragoza in
Spain), and
excluding the impact of the optimization at Zumarraga in Spain (Europe segment)
total
steel shipments for 2Q 2017 were 2.0% lower as compared to 2Q 2016, primarily
due to lower shipment volumes in Brazil (-2.5% due to weak construction market),
Europe (down 0.2Mt or -2.2% due to weaker long products) and ACIS (down 0.2Mt
or -5.7% due to weak South Africa market and lower shipments
in Ukraine). 

Sales in 2Q 2017 were $17.2
billion as compared to $16.1 billion for 1Q 2017 and $14.7 billion for 2Q 2016.
Sales in 2Q 2017 were 7.2% higher as compared to 1Q 2017 primarily due to
higher average steel selling prices (+4.8%), higher steel shipments (+2%), higher
market-priced iron ore shipments (+9.5%) offset in part by lower seaborne iron
ore reference prices (-26.6%). Sales in 2Q 2017 were 17% higher as compared to 2Q
2016 primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+21.5%) and higher
seaborne iron ore reference prices (+13.0%) offset by lower steel shipments (-2.8%)
and lower market-priced iron ore shipments (-1.2%).
Depreciation for 2Q 2017
was higher at $676 million as compared to $655 million for 1Q 2017 and stable
as compared to $680 million in 2Q 2016.
Depreciation
increased in 2Q 2017 as compared to 1Q 2017, primarily on account of foreign
exchange differences following the depreciation of USD vs major currencies.


Impairment charges for 2Q 2017 were $46
million related to a downward revision of cash flow projections in South
Africa. Impairment
charges for 2Q 2016 were $49 million related to the sale of the ArcelorMittal
Zaragoza facility in Spain.

Exceptional income for 2Q 2016 was $832 million
relating to a one-time gain on employee benefits following the signing of the
US labour contract[5].

Operating income for 2Q 2017 was $1.4 billion
as compared to $1.6 billion in 1Q 2017 and $1.9 billion in 2Q 2016. Operating results for
2Q 2017 were impacted by impairment charges as discussed above. Operating
results for 2Q 2016 were impacted by exceptional income discussed above. 

Income from associates,
joint ventures and other investments for 2Q 2017 of $120 million was higher as
compared to income for 1Q 2017 of $86 million and lower as compared to $168 million
for 2Q 2016. Income from associates, joint ventures and other investments for 2Q
2017 increased on account of improved performance of the Chinese investees. Income
in 1Q 2017 included the annual dividend declared by Erdemir ($45 million)
offset by a loss on dilution of the Company’s stake in China Oriental[6].
Income
from associates, joint ventures and other investments for 2Q 2016 included an
annual dividend received from Erdemir ($44 million) which in 2017 is included
in 1Q 2017.

Net interest expense
in 2Q 2017 was $207 million as compared to $223 million in 1Q 2017 and $306
million in 2Q 2016.
Net interest expense was lower in 2Q
2017 as compared to 1Q 2017 and 2Q 2016 primarily due to debt reduction
including early bond repayment via debt tenders and repayment at maturity on
bonds during 2016 and 2017.


Foreign exchange and
other net financing gains in 2Q 2017 were $210 million as compared to foreign
exchange and other net financing costs of $133 million for 1Q 2017 and costs of
$450 million in
2Q 2016. The foreign exchange
gains/losses are largely non-cash and primarily relate to the gains/losses from
the impact of the USD movements on euro-denominated deferred tax assets,
partially offset by foreign exchange gain/losses on euro-denominated debt. For 2Q 2017 a foreign
exchange gain of $247 million was recorded (as compared to a gain of $35
million for 1Q 2017) mainly on account of a 6.7% depreciation of the USD
against the Euro (versus 1.4% depreciation in 1Q 2017). Both 2Q 2017 and 1Q 2017 include
non-cash
mark-to-market gains on derivatives (primarily mandatory convertible bonds call
options following the market price increase in the underlying shares) of $150
million and $158 million, respectively. 1Q 2017 includes $159 million on premium
expenses on an early repayment of bonds (settled in April 2017). Foreign exchange and
other net financing costs for 2Q 2016 include a foreign exchange loss of $47
million mainly
on account of USD appreciation of 2.5% against the Euro and 10.9% depreciation
against BRL. 2Q 2016 also includes $237 million premium expense on the early
redemption of bonds.

ArcelorMittal recorded
an income tax expense of $197 million for 2Q 2017 as compared to an income tax expense
of $283 million for 1Q 2017 and an income tax expense of $153 million for 2Q
2016.


ArcelorMittal
recorded net income for 2Q 2017 of $1,322 million, or $1.30 earnings per share[4], as compared to net income for 1Q 2017
of $1,002 million, or $0.98 earnings per share[4], and a net income for 2Q 2016 of $1,112
million, or $1.13 earnings per share[4].

a) 
In
support of the Company’s Action 2020 program that was launched at its fourth
quarter and full-year 2015 earnings announcement, the footprint optimization
project at ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor is now underway, which has resulted in
structural changes required to improve asset and cost optimization. The plan
involves idling redundant operations including the #1 aluminize line, 84” hot
strip mill (HSM), and #5 continuous galvanizing line (CGL) and No.2 steel shop
(idled in 2Q 2017) whilst making further planned investments totalling ~$200
million including a new caster at No.3 steelshop (completed in 4Q 2016),
restoration of the 80” hot strip mill, logistics and Indiana Harbor finishing
are ongoing. The full project scope is expected to be completed in 2018.

b)  On July 7, 2015,
ArcelorMittal Poland announced it was restarting preparations for the relining
of blast furnace No. 5 in Krakow, which was commissioned in 3Q 2016. Total
investments in the primary operations in the Krakow plant will amount to more
than €40 million, which also includes modernization of the basic oxygen furnace
No. 3. Additional projects in the downstream operations will also be
implemented. These include the extension of the hot rolling mill capacity by
0.9 million tons per annum and increasing the hot dip galvanizing capacity by
0.4 million tons per annum commissioned in 2Q 2017. In total, the Group has
invested more than €120 million in its operations in Krakow, including both
upstream and downstream installations.
c) 
Although
the Monlevade wire rod expansion project and Juiz de Fora rebar expansion were
completed in 2015, the Juiz de Fora melt shop project is currently on
hold and is expected to be completed upon Brazil domestic market recovery, and
the Company does not expect to increase shipments until domestic demand
improves.
d) 
ArcelorMittal
Liberia is moving ore extraction from its depleting DSO (direct shipping ore)
deposit at Tokadeh to the nearby, low strip ratio and higher-grade DSO Gangra deposit
where planned ramp up will occur in 2H 2017.
Following a period of exploration
cessation caused by the onset of Ebola, ArcelorMittal Liberia recommenced
drilling for DSO resource extensions in late 2015. During 2016, the operation
at Tokadeh was right-sized to focus on its “natural” Atlantic markets. The
nearby Gangra deposit is now the next development in a staged approach as
opposed to the originally planned phase 2 step up to 15Mtpa of concentrate
sinter fine ore product that was delayed in August 2014 due to the declaration
of force majeure by contractors following the Ebola virus outbreak, and then
reassessed following rapid iron ore price declines over the period since. The Gangra mine, haul road and related existing plant and
equipment upgrades are on track. ArcelorMittal remains committed to
Liberia where it operates a full value chain of mine, rail and port and
where it has been operating the mine on a DSO basis since 2011. The
Company believes that ArcelorMittal Liberia presents a strong, competitive
source of product ore for the international market based on continuing DSO
mining and then moving to a long-term sinter feed concentration phase.

NAFTA
segment crude steel production decreased 7.3% to 5.8 million
metric
tonnes in 2Q 2017 as compared to 6.2 million metric
tonnes for 1Q 2017 primarily due to planned maintenance.

Steel shipments in 2Q 2017 decreased by
3.4% to 5.4 million metric tonnes as compared to 5.6
million metric tonnes in
1Q 2017,
primarily driven by a 3.9% decrease in flat products volumes offset in part by
1.9% increase in long products. 

Sales
in 2Q 2017 increased by 3.3% to $4.6 billion as compared to $4.5 billion in 1Q
2017, primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+5.7%) offset in
part by lower steel shipment volumes as discussed above. Compared to 1Q 2017, average
steel selling prices for flat products improved by +5.8% and for long products
improved by +4.3%. 

Operating
income in 2Q 2017 decreased to $378 million as compared to operating income of
$396 million in 1Q 2017 and operating income of $1,209 million in 2Q 2016. Operating performance
for 2Q 2016 was positively impacted by a one-time gain of $0.8 billion on employee
benefits following the signing of the US labour contract[5].

EBITDA
in 2Q 2017 decreased by 3.3% to $506 million as compared to $524 million in 1Q
2017 primarily due to lower steel shipment volumes (-3.4%) and higher costs, including
planned maintenance ($45 million), partially offset by higher average steel selling
prices. EBITDA
in 2Q 2017 declined by 1.2% as compared to $513 million in 2Q 2016.

Brazil
segment crude steel production was stable at 2.7 million
metric tonnes in
2Q 2017 as compared to 1Q 2017.
Steel shipments in 2Q 2017 increased by 17.8% to 2.6 million
metric tonnes as
compared to 2.2 million metric tonnes in
1Q 2017, primarily due to a 23.4% increase in flat product steel shipments
(primarily export shipments and temporary shipment delays in the
prior quarter) and a 9% increase in long product steel shipments.


Sales in 2Q 2017 increased by 13.9% to $1.8 billion as compared to $1.6 billion
in 1Q 2017, due
to higher steel shipments offset in part by lower average steel selling prices (-3.4%)
driven in part by foreign exchange. 

Operating income in 2Q 2017 decreased
to $128 million as compared to an operating income of $175 million in 1Q 2017 and operating
income of $149 million in 2Q 2016. 
EBITDA
in 2Q 2017 decreased by 18% to $201 million as compared to $246 million in 1Q
2017 primarily
due to a negative price cost impact and weaker product mix offset
in part by higher steel shipment volumes. EBITDA in 1Q 2017 included a $21 million
provision reversal. EBITDA in 2Q 2017 was 5.4% lower as
compared to $213 million in 2Q 2016.

Europe
segment crude steel production decreased by 1.9% to 11.0 million metric tonnes
in 2Q 2017, as compared to 11.2 million metric tonnes in 1Q 2017.

Steel shipments in 2Q 2017 increased by
2.5% to 10.5 million metric tonnes as compared to 10.2 million metric tonnes in
1Q 2017, primarily due to a 3.8% increase in long product shipments and 1.4% increase
in flat product steel shipments.


Sales
in 2Q 2017 increased 11.7% to $9.2 billion as compared to $8.2 billion in 1Q
2017, primarily due to higher steel shipments as
discussed above and higher average steel selling prices (+7.7%), with flat and
long products average steel selling prices increasing +8.4% and +5.7%, respectively.

Operating income in 2Q 2017 was
$652 million as compared to
$636 million in 1Q 2017
and $383 million in 2Q 2016. Operating performance in 2Q
2016 was negatively impacted by $49 million of impairment related to the sale
of ArcelorMittal Zaragoza facility in Spain.

EBITDA in 2Q 2017 increased
by 3.6% to $942 million as compared to $909 million in 1Q 2017 primarily due to
higher steel volumes partially offset by negative price-cost impact. EBITDA in 2Q
2017 improved 29.8% as compared to 2Q 2016 primarily on account of positive
price cost impact offset in part by lower steel shipments.

ACIS segment crude steel production in 2Q
2017 increased by 5.5% to 3.7 million metric tonnes as compared to 3.5 million
metric tonnes in 1Q 2017. The higher production was largely due to increased
output in Ukraine following the planned maintenance of BF#9 in 1Q 2017. 

Steel
shipments in 2Q 2017 increased by 1.1% to 3.3 million metric tonnes as compared
to 3.2 million metric tonnes in 1Q 2017 primarily due to higher steel shipments
in Ukraine as the prior period had been impacted by the planned maintenance as described
above, offset in part by lower South Africa shipments due to weak demand. 

Sales
in 2Q 2017 increased 1.5% to $1.8 billion as compared to 1Q 2017, primarily due
to higher steel shipments (+1.1%) offset in part by lower average steel selling
prices (-0.6%).

Operating income in 2Q 2017 was
$51 million as compared to an operating income of $116 million in 1Q 2017 and
operating income of $162 million in 2Q 2016.
Operating
performance in 2Q 2017 was impacted by impairment charges of $46 million
related to a downward revision of cash flow projections in South Africa.


EBITDA
in 2Q 2017 decreased 9.1% to $174 million as compared to $191 million in 1Q
2017, due to weaker performance in South Africa (impacted by lower volumes and
a negative price cost impact). EBITDA
in 2Q 2017 was 28.2% lower as compared to $242 million in 2Q 2016, primarily due to a negative price
cost impact and lower steel shipment volumes in South Africa.

 Own iron ore production in 2Q 2017 increased
by 4.9% to 14.7
million
metric tonnes as compared to 14 million metric tonnes in 1Q 2017 due to
seasonally higher production in Canada and increased production in Mexico
(Volcan mine restarted February 2017). Own iron ore
production in 2Q 2017 increased by 9.1% as compared to 2Q 2016 primarily due to
increased production in Canada and Mexico.

Market-priced iron ore
shipments
in 2Q 2017 increased 9.5% to 9.5 million metric tonnes as compared to 8.7 million
metric tonnes in 1Q 2017, primarily driven by higher shipments in ArcelorMittal Mines
Canada[8]
and Mexico. Market-priced iron
ore shipments in 2Q 2017 decreased 1.2% as compared to 2Q 2016 driven by decreased
shipments in Canada, Liberia and Brazil offset by higher shipments in Mexico. FY
2017 market-priced iron ore shipments are still expected to increase by approximately
10% versus FY 2016.

Own
coal production in 2Q 2017 decreased by 5.8% to 1.6 million metric tonnes as
compared to 1.7 million metric tonnes at 1Q 2017 due to lower production in Kazakhstan.
Own coal production in 2Q 2017 increased 11.5% as compared to 2Q 2016 with increases
at both Kazakhstan and Princeton (US) mines. 

Market-priced
coal shipments in 2Q 2017 increased 3% to 0.8 million metric tonnes as compared
to 1Q 2017 primarily due to increased shipments at Princeton (US). Market-priced
coal shipments in 2Q 2017 increased 17.2% as compared to 2Q 2016 primarily due
to increased shipments at Princeton (US) and Kazakhstan.

Operating
income in 2Q 2017 decreased to $216 million as compared to an operating income
of $378 million in 1Q 2017, and an operating income of $62 million in 2Q 2016,
primarily for the reasons discussed below. 

EBITDA
in 2Q 2017 decreased 33.7% to $319 million as compared to $480 million in 1Q
2017, primarily due to decreased seaborne iron ore reference prices (-26.6%) and
lower coal prices, partially offset by higher market-priced iron ore shipments.
EBITDA in
2Q 2017 was significantly higher as compared to $163 million in 2Q 2016,
primarily due to higher seaborne iron ore reference prices (+13%) and higher
coal prices offset in part by lower market-priced iron ore shipment volumes (-1.2%). 


Liquidity
and Capital Resources


For 2Q 2017, net cash provided by operating
activities was $1,214 million as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of $299 million in 1Q 2017 and net cash provided by operating
activities of $869 million in 2Q 2016. The net cash provided by operating
activities during 2Q 2017 reflects in part a working capital investment ($548
million) as a result of higher inventory, smaller as compared to a working
capital investment ($2,181 million) in 1Q 2017.


Net cash used in investing
activities during 2Q 2017 was $738 million as compared to net cash used in
investing activities of $598 million in 1Q 2017 and net cash provided by
investing activities of $538 million in 2Q 2016. Capital expenditure decreased to
$566 million in 2Q 2017 as compared to $580 million in 1Q 2017 and $521 million
in 2Q 2016. FY 2017 capital expenditure is expected to be $2.9 billion.
Investing activities in 2Q 2017 include $44 million cash
consideration (net of cash acquired for $14 million) for the acquisition of a
55.5% stake in Bekaert Sumare (a tire cord manufacturer in Brazil) and $110 million
deposited in a restricted cash account in ArcelorMittal South Africa in
connection with various environmental obligations and true sale of receivable
programs.  


Net cash used in
financing activities
for 2Q 2017 was $744 million as
compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $666 million for 1Q
2017 and net cash used in financing activities of $1.9 billion for 2Q 2016. Net cash used in
financing activities for 2Q 2017 primarily includes $851 million used to early
redeem the 9.85% Notes due June 1, 2019. On May 25, 2017,
ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited, signed a 4.5 billion South African Rand (approximately
$350 million) revolving borrowing base finance facility maturing on May 25,
2020. As of June 30, 2017, $258 million was drawn. Net cash provided by
financing activities for 1Q 2017 primarily includes proceeds
from the European Investment Bank loan[9]
of €350
million ($373 million) and $0.3 billion of commercial paper
issuances. Net cash used in financing activities for 2Q 2016 primarily includes
payments totalling $4.9 billion relating to bond repurchases pursuant to cash
tender offers ($2.1 billion); early redemption of the 4.5% Notes due February
25, 2017 ($1.4 billion) and €1.0 billion in bond repayments at maturity,
partially offset by proceeds from a $3.1 billion rights issue.

During 1Q 2017, the Company paid dividends of $40 million
primarily to minority shareholders in
ArcelorMittal Mines Canada[8]. During 2Q 2016 the Company paid dividends primarily to minority
shareholders in ArcelorMittal Mines Canada[8] and Brazil (Bekaert) of
$41 million.

As
of June 30, 2017, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.3 billion
as compared to $2.4 billion at March 31, 2017 and $2.4 billion at June 30, 2016.
Gross debt decreased to $14.2 billion as of June 30, 2017, as compared to $14.5
billion at March 31, 2017 and $15.1 billion at June 30, 2016. 

As of June 30, 2017, net debt decreased
to $11.9 billion as compared with $12.1 billion at March 31, 2017 primarily due
to positive free cashflow, despite working capital investment, offset in part
by forex ($0.4 billion), and was lower than the net debt of $12.7 billion as of
June 30, 2016.


As
of June 30, 2017, the Company had liquidity of $7.8 billion, consisting of cash
and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and $5.5 billion of available credit lines[10]. The $5.5 billion
credit facility contains a financial covenant of 4.25x Net debt / EBITDA. On June
30, 2017, the average debt maturity was 6.4 years. 


Key recent
developments 


 On June 21,
    2017, as a result of the extension of the partnership between ArcelorMittal and
    Bekaert Group (“Bekaert”) in the steel cord business in Brazil, the Company
    completed the acquisition from Bekaert of a 55.5% controlling interest in
    Bekaert Sumaré Ltda subsequently renamed ArcelorMittal Bekaert Sumaré Ltda
    (“Sumaré”), a manufacturer of metal ropes for automotive tires located in the
    municipality of Sumaré/SP, Brazil. The Company agreed to pay a total cash
    consideration of €56 million ($49 million net of cash acquired of $14 million),
    of which €52 million ($58 million) was settled on closing date and €4 million
    ($5 million) to be paid subsequently upon conclusion of certain business
    restructuring measures by Bekaert.
 On June
    16, 2017, ArcelorMittal and Marcegaglia announced that AM Investco Italy Srl
    (‘AM Investco’) had concluded the exclusive negotiation phase and reached a
    binding agreement concerning the lease and obligation to purchase Ilva S.p.A
    and certain of its subsidiaries with the Italian Government. The ancillary
    documentation was completed on June 28, 2017. The closing of the transaction is
    subject to certain conditions precedent, including receipt of anti-trust approvals.
    Intesa Sanpaolo will formally join the consortium before transaction closing.


Transaction highlights and key details of AM Investco’s plans for
Ilva include:

 Purchase
    price of €1.8 billion, with annual leasing costs of €180 million to be paid in
    quarterly installments. Ilva’s assets will be initially leased by AM Investco,
    with rental payments qualifying as down payments against the purchase price. Lease
    period to be a minimum of two years.
Robust investment plan to materially improve Ilva’s environmental footprint and
    realise its full potential, including investments of approximately €2.4 billion
    (approximately €2.1 billion net of funds seized from the former shareholder)
    over a seven-year period;
€10 million
    start-up investment in new research and development (R&D) centre in
    Taranto, which will initially focus on ensuring a successful deployment of the
    industrial, environment and commercial plans, while also ensuring a smooth
    transfer of ArcelorMittal R&D intellectual property and knowledge to
    enhance operationally efficiency, quality and productivity at all Ilva plants;
The assets
    will be transferred to AM Investco free of long term liabilities and financial
    debt and will include €1 billion of net working capital, subject to adjustment;
Identified
    synergies of €310 million targeted by 2020 (excludes impact from fixed cost reductions
    and volume improvements).
On June 2, 2017, ArcelorMittal officially launched the second
    generation of its iCARe® electrical steels at this year’s coil-winding expo
    CWIEME in Berlin, between June 20-22, 2017. iCARe® steel grades play a central
    role in the construction of electric motors which are used in both electric
    vehicles and conventional cars.
On May 25, 2017, ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited, signed a 4.5
    billion South African Rand (approximately $350 million) revolving borrowing
    base finance facility maturing on May 25, 2020. Any borrowings under the
    facility will be secured by certain eligible inventory and receivables, as well
    as certain other working capital and related assets of ArcelorMittal South
    Africa. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes. The facility
    is not guaranteed by ArcelorMittal. As of June 30, 2017, $258 million was
    drawn.
On May 22,
    2017, following the approval of the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below) by
    the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of ArcelorMittal held on May
    10, 2017, ArcelorMittal has completed the consolidation of each three existing
    shares in ArcelorMittal without nominal value into one share without nominal
    value (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result, the share capital of ArcelorMittal
    is now represented by 1,021,903,623 ordinary shares without nominal value while
    the authorised share capital of ArcelorMittal is represented by 1,151,576,921
    ordinary shares without nominal value.
On May 10, 2017, Poland’s deputy prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki
    took part in an official ceremony to mark the completion of a series of
    important investment projects at ArcelorMittal Poland’s Kraków unit. Investments
    exceeding €120 million which were commissioned in 2016, and achieved their
    operational ramp-up very recently, included the relining of blast furnace no 5,
    modernization of the basic oxygen furnace, capacity expansion of the hot
    rolling mill and a new galvanizing line. 



Outlook and
guidance 


The following global
apparent steel consumption (“ASC”) figures have been updated to reflect the Company’s
latest outlook for 2017.


Based on the current economic outlook, ArcelorMittal has
raised its 2017 global steel demand forecasts. 2017 global ASC is now expected
to grow by approximately +2.5% to +3.0% (revised up from previous forecast
+0.5% to +1.5%). By region: ASC in the US (excluding Pipe & tube) is now
expected to grow +2.0% to +3.0% (revised down from previous forecast of +3.0%
to 4.0%) reflecting lower automotive production impacting flat products. In
Europe, ArcelorMittal expects the pick-up in underlying demand to continue,
driven primarily by strength of the construction and machinery markets, and
apparent demand is expected to remain at +0.5% to +1.5% in 2017 on top of
around 3% growth in 2016. In Brazil, 2017 ASC is expected to grow by +2.0%
to +3.0% in 2017 (revised down from previous forecast +3.0% to +4.0%) as the
continued weakness in construction is partially offset by mild improvement in
consumer confidence and automotive demand. In the CIS, ASC is expected to
grow +2.0 to +2.5% (revised up from previous forecast of -0.5% to +0.5%)
reflecting stronger economic growth in Russia. In China, ASC growth of +2.5% to
+3.5% in 2017 (revised up from previous forecast of -1.0% to 0%), primarily due
to strength in real estate and machinery. 

Current market conditions are improved compared to twelve
months ago with steel spreads currently at healthy levels. The demand
environment is positive, as evidenced by the highest readings from the ArcelorMittal
weighted PMI Index since April 2011, which suggests that steel shipments in 2H
2017 will be higher than would normally be suggested by seasonality alone.

The Company now expects that the cash needs of the
business (excluding working capital and premiums paid to retire debt early of
$0.2 billion (not included in previous guidance)) in 2017 to be approximately
$4.6 billion (as compared to $5.0 billion previous guidance). Given the
liability management exercise and lower average debt we now expect interest
expense in 2017 to decline to $0.8 billion in 2017 (as compared to $0.9 billion
from previous guidance and $1.1 billion in FY 2016). While capex expectation
for 2017 remains at $2.9 billion (from $2.4 billion in 2016), the Company
expects lower cash taxes and contributions to fund pensions and other cash
expenses to be lower than previous guidance.

Given the improved market conditions, the Company now
expects a full year 2017 investment in working capital of approximately $1.5
billion (as compared to previous guidance of approximately $1 billion).

Appendix 8: Terms and definitions


Unless
indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this
earnings release report to the following terms have the meanings set out next
to them below:


Average
steel selling prices:
calculated as steel sales divided by steel shipments.


Cash
and cash equivalents: 
represents
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments.


Capex:
includes the
acquisition of tangible and intangible assets. 


EBITDA:
operating income plus
depreciation, impairment expenses and exceptional income/(charges).


EBITDA/tonne:
calculated as EBITDA
divided by total steel shipments.


Exceptional
income / (charges): 
relate
to transactions that are significant, infrequent or unusual and are not
representative of the normal course of business such as restructuring costs or
asset disposals.


Foreign
exchange and other net financing (loss) / gain:
include foreign
currency exchange impact, bank fees, interest on pensions, impairments of
financial instruments, revaluation of derivative instruments and other charges
that cannot be directly linked to operating results. 


Free
cash flow
:
Refers to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capex. 


Gross
debt
:
long-term debt, plus short term debt (including those held as part of
liabilities held for sale).


Iron
ore unit cash cost:
includes weighted average pellet and concentrate cost of goods sold across all

Mining
segment sales:
i) “External sales”: mined product sold to third parties at market price; ii)
“Market-priced tonnes”: internal sales of mined product to ArcelorMittal
facilities and reported at prevailing market prices; iii) “Cost-plus tonnes” -
internal sales of mined product to ArcelorMittal facilities on a cost-plus
basis. The determinant of whether internal sales are reported at market price
or cost-plus is whether the raw material could practically be sold to third
parties (i.e. there is a potential market for the product and logistics exist
to access that market). 


Market-priced
tonnes:
represent amounts of iron ore and coal from ArcelorMittal mines that could be
sold to third parties on the open market. Market-priced tonnes that are not
sold to third parties are transferred from the Mining segment to the Company’s
steel producing segments and reported at the prevailing market price. Shipments
of raw materials that do not constitute market-priced tonnes are transferred
internally and reported on a cost-plus basis.


Net
debt:

Net
debt/EBITDA:
Refers to Net debt divided by last twelve months EBITDA calculation.

lumps (excludes share of production and strategic long-term contracts).


S

eaborne iron ore
reference prices:
refers to iron ore prices for 62% Fe CFR China.


Shipments
information at
segment and group level eliminates intra–segment shipments (which are primarily
between Flat/Long plants and Tubular plants) and inter-segment shipments
respectively. Shipments of Downstream Solutions are excluded.


Steel-only EBITDA:
calculated as EBITDA
less Mining segment EBITDA. 


Steel-only
EBITDA/tonne:
calculated as steel-only EBITDA divided by total steel shipments.

[1]The financial information in this press
release has been prepared consistently with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union. The interim financial
information included in this announcement has been also prepared in accordance
with IFRS applicable to interim periods, however this announcement does not
contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as
defined in International Accounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”.
The numbers in this press release have not been audited. The financial
information and certain other information presented in a number of tables in
this press release have been rounded to the nearest whole number or the nearest
decimal. Therefore, the sum of the numbers in a column may not conform exactly
to the total figure given for that column. In addition, certain percentages
presented in the tables in this press release reflect calculations based upon
the underlying information prior to rounding and, accordingly, may not conform
exactly to the percentages that would be derived if the relevant calculations
were based upon the rounded numbers. This press release also includes certain
non-GAAP financial measures. ArcelorMittal presents EBITDA, and EBITDA/tonne,
which are non-GAAP financial measures and defined in appendix 7, as additional
measurements to enhance the understanding of operating performance. ArcelorMittal
believes such indicators are relevant to describe trends relating to cash
generating activity and provides management and investors with additional
information for comparison of the Company’s operating results to the operating
results of other companies. ArcelorMittal also presents net debt and the ratio
of net debt to EBITDA as an additional measurement to enhance the understanding
of its financial position, changes to its capital structure and its credit assessment.
ArcelorMittal also presents free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial
measure defined in appendix 7, because it believes it is a useful supplemental
measure for evaluating the strength of its cash generating capacity. Non-GAAP
financial measures should be read in conjunction with and not as an alternative
for, ArcelorMittal's financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
applied by other companies.

appendix 7.
[3]On February 23, 2017, ArcelorMittal Brasil
S.A. and Votorantim S.A. announced the signing of a definitive agreement,
pursuant to which Votorantim’s long steel businesses in Brazil, Votorantim
Siderurgia, will become a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal Brasil and Votorantim
will hold a minority stake in ArcelorMittal Brasil. Votorantim’s long steel
operations in Argentina (Acerbrag) and Colombia (PazdelRío) were not included
in the transaction. The combination of the businesses will result in a long
product steel producer with annual crude steel capacity of 5.6 million metric
tonnes and annual rolling capacity of 5.4 million metric tonnes. The
transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in Brazil, including the
approval of the Brazilian anti-trust authority CADE. Until closing,
ArcelorMittal Brasil and Votorantim Siderurgia will remain fully separate and
independent companies.
[4]At the Extraordinary
General Meeting held on May 10, 2017, the ArcelorMittal Shareholders approved a
share consolidation based on a ratio 1:3, whereby every three current shares are
consolidated into one share (with a change in the number of shares outstanding
and the accounting par value per share). The figures presented for the basic
and diluted earnings per share reflect this change and are considering the
share consolidation.


[5]
On June 23, 2016, following the ratification
by the United Steelworkers of a new labor agreement which is valid until
September 1, 2018, ArcelorMittal made changes mainly to healthcare post-retirement
benefits in its subsidiary ArcelorMittal USA (NAFTA). The changes resulted in a
gain of $832 million recorded in 2Q 2016.
[6]China Oriental completed a share placement
to restore the minimum 25% free float as per HKEx listing requirements.
Following the share placement, ArcelorMittal’s interest in China Oriental
decreased from 47% to 39%, as a result of which ArcelorMittal recorded a net
dilution loss of $44 million.
[7]On February 5, 2016 ArcelorMittal announced
it had sold its 35% stake in Gestamp Automoción ("Gestamp") to the majority
shareholder, the Riberas family, for a total cash consideration of €875 million
($971 million). In addition to the cash consideration, ArcelorMittal received
in 2Q 2016 a payment of $11 million as a 2015 dividend. ArcelorMittal will
continue its supply relationship with Gestamp through its 35% shareholding in
Gonvarri, a sister company of Gestamp. ArcelorMittal sells coils to Gonvarri
for processing before they pass to Gestamp and other customers. Further,
ArcelorMittal will continue to have a board presence in Gestamp, collaborate in
automotive R&D and remain its major steel supplier. 
[8]ArcelorMittal Mines Canada, otherwise known
as ArcelorMittal Mines and Infrastructure Canada
[9]On December 16, 2016, ArcelorMittal signed a
€350 million finance contract with the European Investment Bank in order to
finance European research, development and innovation projects over the
2017-2020 period within the European Union, predominantly France, Belgium and
Spain, but also in the Czech Republic, Poland, Luxembourg and Romania. The
Company benefits from a guarantee from the European Union under the European
Fund for Strategic Investments.
[10]On December 21, 2016,
ArcelorMittal signed an agreement for a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility
(the "Facility"). This Facility amends and restates the $6 billion
revolving credit facility dated April 30, 2015. The amended agreement
incorporates a first tranche of $2.3 billion maturing on December 21, 2019, and
a second tranche of $3.2 billion maturing on December 21, 2021. The Facility
may be used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2017, the $5.5
billion revolving credit facility remains fully available.
[11]Assets and
liabilities held for sale, as of June 30, 2017, and as of March 31, 2017, primarily
include the carrying value of the USA long product facilities at Steelton
(“Steelton”). Assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2016,
include the carrying value of Steelton and some activities of ArcelorMittal Downstream
Solutions in the Europe segment and America’s Tailored Blanks

3 July, 2017 -  ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’), the world’s leading integrated steel and mining company is hosting an event this evening and tomorrow in Ghent, Belgium for financial analysts and investors.
 The purpose of the event is to focus on how ArcelorMittal will maintain industry leadership through the implementation of its strategic plan Action 2020, with a specific focus on the European flat business.  A series of presentations will:

Highlight progress made in transforming the competitiveness of the European flat business
Showcase Ghent as a benchmark of excellence in the European integrated steel industry
Present the strategic plan and key initiatives that will support further transformation and outperformance of the European flat business versus the competition

ArcelorMittal Flat Europe has transformed its competitiveness in recent years, optimizing its footprint, investing for growth in high added value segments and leveraging R&D and technology strengths to provide cutting edge solutions for the most demanding end markets.  Its drive towards excellence has resulted in productivity gains and outperformance versus the competition.  The company is confident it will maintain this progress and momentum and will discuss key opportunities for the business in the coming years including:

The integration of Ilva, Italy’s leading integrated steel producer.  Ilva represents a unique opportunity to add significant value to ArcelorMittal’s European business. It provides ArcelorMittal with a primary production presence in Italy, Europe’s second largest steel consuming market.  Strategically well located, sitting next to one of Europe’s largest deep-water ports, with significant finishing capacity, it has the potential to be a Tier 1 asset.   
The Europe Transformation Plan, which is part of Action 2020.  The group’s European footprint offers a unique advantage to leverage the benefits of size and scale and implement a series of efficiency improvement initiatives to sustainably improve results.  Fundamentally the transformation plan aims to sustainably improve the competitive position of ArcelorMittal’s European flat business and create a positive performance gap over the competition. 
Digitization. The group has been studying the multiple opportunities that exist from digitization and has already started to implement new digital solutions in line with Industry 4.0.  The business areas offering the most potential are procurement, distribution and commercial.  Considerable work is also underway to conceptualize the smart factory of the future.  The potential is considerable and includes the use of drones, virtual reality and the internet of things.
Continued development of cutting edge products and processes. Our R&D team continues to push the boundaries in terms of both product and process development.  Recent examples in process technology includes the Jet Vapor Deposition line, which coats moving strips of steel in a vacuum chamber; ACCtec, a new unique continuously cooling technology for plates, which provides enhanced quality and cost savings; and the Hybrid Filtration technology, which significantly cuts dust emissions.  On the product side, the group continues to build on its industry leading products for the automotive industry and is also developing ground-breaking products for industry and construction.
Sustainability as a driver of innovation. The group is convinced that the focus on sustainability will create new opportunities for steel as the benefits of its life-cycle performance become better appreciated and has created its new sustainable innovation tool to demonstrate steel’s superior credentials.  
The transformation of waste gases into bio-ethanol. Still very early in development, the group is testing the potential to transform waste-gases into bio-ethanol, partnering with leading carbon technology company Lanzatech.  A pilot plant will be built in Ghent to test the scalability and commercial success of this technology, which if successful will help reduce carbon emissions.  

Speakers include Aditya Mittal, Group CFO and CEO Europe, Geert Van Poelvoorde, Executive Vice President, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe Flat Products, Greg Ludkovsky, Vice President, Global Head of R&D and Matthieu Jehl, CEO ArcelorMittal Belgium.

Commenting, Mr.
Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:


“
I am
satisfied with the first quarter results, which reflect the anticipated
positive momentum in the market and the progress we are making internally to
make the business stronger. All parts of the business reported improved
EBITDA as steel prices responded to higher raw material costs and strong volume
growth saw steel shipments increase by 5.1% compared with the fourth
quarter. Our mining segment benefitted from an increase in iron-ore
shipped at market prices as well as the higher raw material price
environment. Looking ahead, we expect market conditions to be broadly
stable in the second quarter. While this is encouraging, the steel
industry is still impacted by unfair imports in many of our key markets and we
hope to see further progress in ensuring the necessary trade solutions”.

Key
corporate responsibility highlights for 1Q 2017:


 ArcelorMittal’s
    2016 annual review entitled “Sustainable Progress” was published on May 3,
    2017, demonstrating the significant
    steps the Company has taken towards integrated reporting. It sets out the
    progress towards its Action 2020 plan, segment by segment, referencing the
    importance of social and environmental value drivers in this process. The
    report also includes a section on Beyond 2020, which identifies the key drivers
    for long-term value creation and outlines several initiatives the Company is
    undertaking to deliver on as follows:
    
critical
        breakthrough carbon capture and utilisation technology to reduce CO2 emissions
a
        new Sustainable Innovation tool to ensure all new Global R&D projects make
        an improved contribution to sustainable development
the
        ResponsibleSteel™ scheme, which is bringing together customers, suppliers,
        steelmakers and others, to create a common, trusted, social and environmental certification
        standard. ArcelorMittal plays a leading role and began to pilot a draft
        standard in March 2017.



    ArcelorMittal
    Zenica (Bosnia & Herzegovina) undertook, in February 2017, an
    industrial-scale installation of the Company’s new hybrid filter technology,
    designed to reduce air emissions at the sinter plant to well below the EU
    limit. A second installation will follow. 



Analysis of results for 1Q 2017 versus 4Q 2016
and 1Q 2016 


Total
steel shipments in 1Q 2017
were 5.1% higher at 21.1 million metric
tonnes as compared with 20.0 million metric tonnes for 4Q 2016 primarily due to
improved shipments in NAFTA (+12.0%), Europe (+7.1%) and ACIS (+4.1%) offset in
part by lower shipments in Brazil (-21.7%). Total steel shipments for 1Q 2017 were
1.9% lower as compared to 1Q 2016 primarily due to lower shipment volumes in
Brazil (-9.9%), Europe (-2.3%) and ACIS (-2.8%) offset in part by improved shipments
in NAFTA (+2.7%). On a comparable basis (considering the sale
of long steel producing subsidiaries in the US (LaPlace and Vinton) in 2Q 2016
and Zaragoza in Spain during 3Q 2016), total steel shipments for 1Q 2017 were
0.9% lower as compared with 21.2 million metric tonnes for 1Q 2016.

Sales in 1Q 2017 were $16.1
billion as compared to $14.1 billion for 4Q 2016 and $13.4 billion for 1Q 2016.
Sales in 1Q 2017 were 13.9% higher as compared to 4Q 2016 primarily due to
higher average steel selling prices (+10.2%), higher steel shipments (+5.1%), higher
seaborne iron ore reference prices (+21.0%) and higher market-priced iron ore
shipments (+6.4%). Sales in 1Q 2017 were 20.1% higher as compared to 1Q 2016
primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+24.9%), higher seaborne
iron ore reference prices (+77.3%) and higher market-priced iron ore shipments (+11.2%),
offset in part by lower steel shipments (-1.9%).

Depreciation for 1Q
2017 was lower at $655 million as compared to $696 million for 4Q 2016 and stable
as compared to $652 million in 1
Q 2016. FY 2017 depreciation is expected to be
approximately $2.8 billion (based on current exchange rates).

Impairment charges for 1Q 2017 and 1Q 2016 were
nil. Impairment charges for 4Q 2016 were $156 million mainly related to the Vanderbijlpark plant
in South Africa.


Operating income for 1Q 2017 was $1.6 billion
as compared to $0.8 billion in 4Q 2016 and $275 million in 1Q 2016. Operating income
for 4Q 2016 was impacted by impairments as discussed above. Operating income
for 1Q 2017 was higher as compared to 4Q 2016 primarily due to higher operating
results in steel business as well as improved results in the Mining segment
driven primarily by higher seaborne iron ore prices.

Income from associates, joint ventures
and other investments for 1Q 2017 was $86 million as compared to $14 million
for 4Q 2016, primarily due to the annual dividend declared by Erdemir ($45
million) and improved performance of Calvert, offset in part by a loss on
dilution of the Company’s stake in China Oriental[4]. Income from
associates, joint ventures and other investments for 1Q 2016 of $324 million included a $329 million
gain on disposal of Gestamp[5].

Net interest expense
in 1Q 2017 was $223 million as compared to $221 million in 4Q 2016 and $332 million
in 1Q 2016. Net interest expense was lower in 1Q 2017 as compared to 1Q 2016 primarily
due to debt reduction including early bond repayment via debt tenders during
2016.


Foreign exchange and other net financing
costs in 1Q 2017 were $133 million as compared to $278 million for 4Q 2016 and a gain in 1Q 2016 of
$9 million.
Foreign exchange gains/losses primarily relate to the impact of the USD
movements on Euro denominated deferred tax assets and Euro denominated debt. For
1Q 2017 a foreign exchange gain of $35 million was recorded (as compared to a
loss of $128 million for 4Q 2016) mainly on account of a 1.4% depreciation of
the USD against the Euro (versus 5.6% appreciation in 4Q 2016). Foreign exchange and
other net financing costs for 1Q 2017 includes $159 million in premium accrued on
an early repayment of bonds (settled in April 2017), offset by non-cash mark to
market gains on certain derivatives (primarily mandatory convertible bonds call
options following the market price increase in the underlying shares). Foreign exchange and
other net financing costs in 4Q 2016 included $0.1 billion non-cash expense in
connection with the issuance of shares in the context of the B-BBEE transaction
in South Africa[6].
Foreign
exchange and other net financing gain for 1Q 2016 included a foreign exchange
gain of $107 million primarily on account of a 4.6% depreciation of the USD against
the Euro.
ArcelorMittal recorded
an income tax expense of $283 million for 1Q 2017 as compared to an income tax
benefit of $13 million for 4Q 2016 and an income tax expense of $700 million
for 1Q 2016. The tax expense in 1Q 2017 largely reflects improved results
in a number of countries. The prior periods were impacted by the tax rate
change and recoverability assessment of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.

Net income
attributable to non-controlling interests for 1Q 2017 of $21 million represents minority shareholders’
share of net income recorded in ArcelorMittal Mines Canada[7]
and Belgo
Bekaert Arames in Brazil
offset in part by their share
of losses generated by ArcelorMittal South Africa. Net loss attributable to
non-controlling interests for 4Q 2016 of $66 million
and for 1Q 2016 of $8 million
primarily represents their share of losses
generated by ArcelorMittal South Africa.

ArcelorMittal
recorded net income for 1Q 2017 of $1,002 million, or $0.33 earnings per share[3], as compared to net income for 4Q 2016
of $403 million, or $0.13 earnings per share[3], and a net loss for 1Q 2016 of $416
million, or $0.23 loss per share[3].

a) 
In
support of the Company’s Action 2020 program that was launched at its fourth
quarter and full-year 2015 earnings announcement, the footprint optimization
project at ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor is now underway, which has resulted in
structural changes required to improve asset and cost optimization. The plan
involves idling redundant operations including the #1 aluminize line, 84” hot
strip mill (HSM), and #5 continuous galvanizing line (CGL) and No.2 steel shop
(expected to be idled in 2Q 2017) whilst making further planned investments
totalling ~$200 million including a new caster at No.3 steelshop (completed in
4Q 2016), restoration of the 80” hot strip mill and Indiana Harbor finishing
and logistics. The project is expected to be completed in 2018.

b)  On July 7, 2015,
ArcelorMittal Poland announced it was restarting preparations for the relining
of blast furnace No. 5 in Krakow, which has now been completed during 3Q 2016. Total
investments in the primary operations in the Krakow plant will amount to PLN
200 million (more than €40 million), which also includes modernization of the basic
oxygen furnace No. 3. Additional projects in the downstream operations will
also be implemented. These include the extension of the hot rolling mill
capacity by 0.9 million tons per annum and increasing the hot dip galvanizing
capacity by 0.4 million tons per annum. The capex value of those two projects
exceeds PLN 300 million (€90 million) in total. In total, the Group will invest
more than PLN 500 million (more than €130 million) in its operations in Krakow,
including both upstream and downstream installations.
c) 
Though
the Monlevade wire rod expansion project and Juiz de Fora rebar expansion were
completed in 2015, and Juiz de Fora melt shop project is currently on
hold and is expected to be completed upon Brazil domestic market recovery, the
Company does not expect to increase shipments until domestic demand improves.
d) 
ArcelorMittal
Liberia is moving ore extraction from its depleting DSO (direct shipping ore)
deposit at Tokadeh to the nearby, low strip ratio and higher grade DSO Gangra
deposit by 3Q 2017. Following a period of exploration cessation caused by the
onset of Ebola, ArcelorMittal Liberia recommenced drilling for DSO resource
extensions in late 2015. During 2016, the operation at Tokadeh was right-sized
to 3 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) to focus on its “natural” Atlantic markets.
The nearby Gangra deposit is now the preferred next development in a staged
approach as opposed to the originally planned phase 2 step up to 15Mtpa of
concentrated sinter fine ore that was delayed in August 2014 due to the
declaration of force majeure by contractors following the Ebola virus outbreak,
and then reassessed following rapid iron ore price declines over the period
since. Accordingly, the Gangra mine, haul road and
related existing plant and equipment upgrades are on track. ArcelorMittal
remains committed to Liberia where it operates a full value chain of mine, rail
and port and where it has been operating the mine on a DSO basis
since 2011. With 2 billion tonnes of iron ore resource in its lease, ArcelorMittal
Liberia presents a strong, competitive source of product ore for the
international market based on continuing DSO mining and then moving to a long-term
sinter feed and concentration phase.

NAFTA
segment crude steel production increased 19.6% to 6.2 million
metric
tonnes in 1Q 2017 as compared to 5.2 million metric
tonnes for 4Q 2016 in line with improved demand.

Steel
shipments in 1Q 2017 increased by 12.0% to 5.6 million metric tonnes as
compared to 5.0 million metric tonnes in
4Q 2016,
primarily driven by a 14.9% increase in flat products volumes reflecting the
end of the destock in the US which negatively impacted shipments in the prior
period.

Sales
in 1Q 2017 increased by 17.5% to $4.5 billion as compared to $3.8 billion in 4Q
2016, primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+5.6%) and higher
steel shipment volumes as discussed above. Compared to the 4Q 2016, average
steel selling prices for long products improved +10.0% and for flat products improved
+4.1%.

Operating
income in 1Q 2017 increased to $396 million as compared to operating income of
$164 million in 4Q 2016 and operating income of $205 million in 1Q 2016. 

EBITDA
in 1Q 2017 increased by 74% to $524 million as compared to $301 million in 4Q 2016
primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes (+12.0%) and a positive price cost impact
with average steel selling prices higher by +5.6%. EBITDA in 1Q 2017 improved 54.4%
as compared to $339 million in 1Q 2016 due primarily to a positive price cost impact
with average steel selling prices higher by +13.2%.

Brazil
segment crude steel production decreased by 2.5% to 2.7 million
metric tonnes in
1Q 2017 as compared to 2.8 million metric tonnes in 4Q 2016, primarily due
to planned maintenance at Tubarao, Brazil.

Steel shipments in 1Q 2017 decreased by 21.7% to 2.2 million metric tonnes as
compared
to 2.8 million
metric tonnes in
4Q 2016, primarily due to a 27.3% decrease in flat product steel
shipments
(primarily export shipments,
given the need to rebuild inventory following maintenance and ahead of the
seasonally stronger demand period, as well as temporary shipment delays) and a
10.2% decrease in long product steel shipments (primarily reflecting weak
domestic demand).


Sales in 1Q 2017 decreased by 8.0% to $1.6 billion as compared to $1.8 billion
in 4Q 2016, due
to lower
steel shipments as discussed above, offset in part by 20.1% increase in average steel
selling prices,
with average US dollar selling prices for flat products improving by 28%
(reflecting higher domestic prices as well as the mix benefit of lower slab
exports) and improving by 11.3% for long products. 

Operating income in 1Q 2017 increased
to $175 million as compared to an operating income of $143 million in 4Q 2016 and operating
income of $89 million in 1Q 2016. 

EBITDA
in 1Q 2017 increased by 15.3% to $246 million as compared to $213 million in 4Q
2016
primarily
due to a $21 million provision reversal as well as a positive price cost impact
offset in part by lower steel shipment volumes. EBITDA in 1Q 2017 was
69.1% higher as compared to $145 million in 1Q 2016 due to a positive price
cost impact with a 43.2% increase in average steel selling prices in US$ terms,
offset in part by lower steel shipments by -9.9% (flat exports down 14.8% and
long product down 14.2%).

Europe
segment crude steel production increased by 10.2% to 11.2 million metric tonnes
in 1Q 2017, as compared to 10.2 million metric tonnes in 4Q 2016 (which was
impacted by the planned reline at ArcelorMittal Asturias, Spain).

Steel shipments in 1Q 2017 increased by
7.1% to 10.2 million metric tonnes as compared to 9.5 million metric tonnes in 4Q
2016, primarily due to a 12.8% increase in flat product shipments due to
improved demand offset partly by a 5.4% decline in long product steel shipments.


Sales
in 1Q 2017 increased 15.2% to $8.2 billion as compared to $7.1 billion in 4Q 2016,
primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+9.9%), (with flat and
long products average steel selling prices increasing +9.4% and +9.9%, respectively),
and higher
steel shipments as discussed above.

Operating income in 1Q 2017 was
$636 million as compared to
$387 million in
4Q 2016
and $86 million in 1Q 2016. 

EBITDA in 1Q 2017 increased
by 30.3% to $909 million as compared to $698 million in 4Q 2016 primarily due
to higher steel volumes. EBITDA in 1Q 2017 improved 150.4% as compared
to 1Q 2016 primarily on account of higher average steel selling prices (+22.3%)
and cost efficiency improvements, offset in part by higher input costs.

ACIS segment crude steel production in 1Q
2017 decreased by 4.2% to 3.5
million metric tonnes
as compared to 3.6 million
metric tonnes in 4Q 2016 primarily due to planned maintenance of BF#9 in
Ukraine. 

Steel
shipments in 1Q 2017 increased by 4.1% to 3.2 million metric tonnes as compared
to 3.1 million metric tonnes in 4Q 2016 primarily due to a seasonal improvement
in South Africa offset in part by lower steel shipments in the CIS impacted by
the planned maintenance as described above. 

Sales
in 1Q 2017 increased 18.4% to $1.8 billion as compared to $1.5 billion in 4Q 2016,
primarily due to higher steel shipments (+4.1%) and higher average steel selling
prices (+16.2%).

Operating income in 1Q 2017 was
$116 million as compared to an operating loss of $92 million in 4Q 2016 and
operating loss of $15 million in 1Q 2016. Operating loss in 4Q 2016 was impacted
by impairments of $156 million mainly related to the Vanderbijlpark plant in
South Africa. 

EBITDA
in 1Q 2017 increased +34.2% to $191 million as compared to $142 million in 4Q 2016.
EBITDA in 4Q 2016 was impacted by a one-time charge of $28 million in relation
to environmental liabilities at the Thabazimbi mine in South Africa. EBITDA in 1Q
2017 was higher than 4Q 2016 primarily on account of higher steel shipment
volumes (+4.1%).
EBITDA in
1Q 2017 was higher as compared to $61 million in 1Q 2016, primarily due to a positive
price cost impact.

(a) Own
iron ore and coal production not including strategic long-term contracts.
(b) Iron
ore and coal shipments of market-priced based materials include the Company’s
own mines, and share of production at other mines, and exclude supplies under
strategic long-term contracts.

Own iron ore production in 1Q 2017 increased
by 0.7% to 14.0
million
metric tonnes as compared to 13.9 million metric tonnes in 4Q 2016 due to increased
production in Mexico (Volcan mine restarted February 2017) and Liberia, offset
in part by seasonally lower production in Canada and lower production in the US.
Own iron ore production in 1Q 2017 decreased by 1.0% as
compared to 14.1 million metric tonnes in 1Q 2016
primarily due to decreased production in Liberia and US offset in part by
higher production in Mexico. 

Own iron ore production is
expected to increase in 2017: In Liberia, based on Tokadeh ore together with
the transition to the new Gangra deposit production is expected to increase to
3Mt in 2017 (versus 2Mt in 2016) before ramping up to 5Mtpa in 2018; the restart
of the Volcan mine in Mexico in February 2017 is expected to produce an additional
2Mt (in 2017 versus 2016); production in Ukraine is expected to recover following
resolution of a delay in accessing new tailings disposal land which negatively
impacted production in 2016 by approximately 1Mt.


Market-priced
iron ore shipments
in 1Q 2017 increased 6.4% to 8.7 million metric tonnes as compared to 8.1
million metric tonnes in 4Q 2016, primarily driven by higher shipments in Mexico,
Ukraine and ArcelorMittal
Mines Canada.
During 4Q 2016 market-priced iron ore shipments in ArcelorMittal Mines
Canada were
impacted by logistics and transportation issues following severe weather
conditions. Market-priced iron ore shipments in 1Q 2017 increased by +11.2% as
compared to 1Q 2016 driven by increased ArcelorMittal Mines Canada shipments and Mexico offset
in part by lower Liberia shipments. Given expected higher production described
above, FY 2017 market-priced iron ore shipments are expected to increase by
approximately 10% versus FY 2016.

Own
coal production in 1Q 2017 decreased marginally by 2.6% to 1.7 million metric
tonnes as compared to 4Q 2016. Own coal production in 1Q 2017 increased 20.0% as
compared to 1Q 2016 with increases at both Kazakhstan and Princeton (US) mines.


Market-priced
coal shipments in 1Q 2017 decreased 11.9% to 0.8 million metric tonnes as
compared to 4Q 2016 primarily due to decreased shipments at Princeton (US). Market-priced
coal shipments in 1Q 2017 decreased 7.1% as compared to 1Q 2016 primarily due
to decreased shipments at Princeton (US) offset in part by increased shipments
in Kazakhstan.

Operating
income in 1Q 2017 increased to $378 million as compared to an operating income
of $203 million in 4Q 2016, and an operating loss of $2 million in 1Q 2016,
primarily for the reasons discussed below. 

EBITDA
in 1Q 2017 increased 61.5% to $480 million as compared to $297 million in 4Q
2016, primarily due to increased seaborne iron ore market reference prices (+21.0%)
and increased coal prices. EBITDA in 1Q 2017 was significantly higher as compared to
$98 million in 1Q 2016, primarily due to higher seaborne iron ore reference
prices (+77.3%),
higher market-priced iron ore shipment volumes (+11.2%) and higher coal prices. 


Liquidity
and Capital Resources


For
1Q 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $299 million as compared to net
cash provided by operating activities of $1,653 million in 4Q 2016. The net
cash used in operating activities during 1Q 2017 was impacted by a working
capital investment ($2,181 million) as compared to a working capital release
($495 million) in 4Q 2016.
The change in the working
capital position reflects seasonal changes in inventory and receivables as well
as the effects of higher selling and raw material prices.


Net cash used in investing activities during 1Q 2017 was
$598 million as compared to $809 million in 4Q 2016 and $572 million in 1Q 2016.
Capital expenditure decreased to $580 million in 1Q 2017 as compared to $802
million in 4Q 2016 and $586 million in 1Q 2016. FY 2017 capital expenditure is
expected to be $2.9 billion. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
for 1Q 2017 was $666 million as compared to net cash used in
financing activities of $468 million for 4Q 2016 and net cash provided by
financing activities of $140 million for 1Q 2016. Net cash provided by
financing activities for 1Q 2017 primarily includes proceeds
from the European Investment Bank loan[9]
of €350
million ($373 million) and $0.3 billion of commercial paper
issuances. Net cash used in financing activities for 4Q 2016 primarily includes
repayments of a $0.3 billion loan and $0.5 billion of short term facilities,
offset in part by a $0.3 billion
increase in commercial
paper issuances. In addition, while not reflected in the above amounts, the
Company used $1,040 million of cash and liquidity resources to redeem
outstanding bonds on April 3, 2017 (see Key recent developments).

During 1Q 2017, the Company paid dividends of $40 million
primarily to minority shareholders in ArcelorMittal Mines Canada. During 4Q
2016 and 1Q 2016, the Company paid dividends of $7 million and $6 million,
respectively, to minority shareholders in Belgo Bekaert Arames in Brazil. 

As
of March 31, 2017, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.4 billion
as compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and $2.9 billion at March 31,
2016. Gross debt increased to $14.5 billion as at March 31, 2017, as compared
to $13.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and $20.2 billion at March 31, 2016. The
above-referenced usage of cash to redeem bonds on April 3, 2017 is noted in
this respect. 

As
of March 31, 2017, net debt increased to $12.1 billion as compared with $11.1
billion at December 31, 2016 (primarily due to a working capital investment), but
lower as compared to $17.3 billion as of March 31, 2016. 

As
of March 31, 2017, the Company had liquidity of $7.9 billion, consisting of
cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $5.5 billion of available credit
lines[10]. The $5.5 billion
credit facility contains a financial covenant of 4.25x Net debt / EBITDA. On March
31, 2017, the average debt maturity was 6.4 years.

    years’ term policy for independent directors and will be succeeded by Mr. Bruno
    Lafont as the new Lead Independent Director and chairman of the Appointments,
    Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board of ArcelorMittal

    and service.
 On March
    1, 2017, ArcelorMittal’s Board of Directors had taken note of Mr. Wilbur Ross’
    resignation from the Board as a consequence of his confirmation as United
    States Secretary of Commerce. The Board of ArcelorMittal congratulated Mr. Ross
    on his new role. Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, Chairman & CEO,
    ArcelorMittal, said: “I’ve known Wilbur for more than a decade, since we bought
    his company International Steel Group in 2004. Since then he has been a very
    active and engaged member of our Board and has always been a trusted and valued
    source of advice to me. He’s a very astute and successful businessman, whose
    many years of experience at the heart of international finance and commerce
    mean he is very well positioned to shape policy that promotes economic growth.
    I am sure he will make an excellent Commerce Secretary, bringing great energy,
    experience and wisdom to the role. It is very good news to have such an
    accomplished businessman and investor in government.”  
On March 1, 2017, ArcelorMittal announced the publication of the
    notice to redeem all of its outstanding $1,500 million 9.850% Notes due June 1,
    2019. The settlement, financed with existing cash and liquidity, occurred on

    independent companies.
On
    February 23, 2017, Toyota Europe awarded ArcelorMittal its ‘Built in Quality’ supplier
    award in recognition of the Company’s impressive quality
    performance. ‘Built in Quality’ is a Toyota methodology that aims to
    continuously improve quality. Toyota trains its suppliers to understand and
    implement this methodology in the sites that manufacture products for the
    automotive company. ArcelorMittal’s ‘Built in Quality’ award follows the
    implementation of the methodology, which began around 10 years ago, and comes
    in recognition of ArcelorMittal’s quality performance that has continuously
    improved over the last three years. Toyota Europe gave a number of reasons
    for recognising ArcelorMittal with the award, including:
    
A
        low number of claims (e.g. defects), exceeding Toyota Europe’s quality target
        by more than 15%
Recognition
        as the best steel supplier in Toyota Europe’s annual supplier assessment for
        the second consecutive year

Outlook and guidance 


The following global apparent steel consumption (“ASC”)
figures have been updated to reflect the Company’s final 2016 estimates. The outlook
for 2017 remains unchanged from those presented in connection with the full
year 2016 results announcement.

Global ASC is estimated to have expanded by +1% in 2016.
Based on the current economic outlook, ArcelorMittal expects global ASC to grow
further in 2017 by between ~ +0.5% to +1.5%. By region: ASC in the US (excluding
Pipe & tube) declined in 2016 by approximately -2.0%, driven in large part
by a significant destock in the 2H 2016. However, underlying demand continues
to expand, and the expected absence of a further destock in 2017 should support
ASC growth in the US of approximately +3.0% to 4.0% in 2017. In Europe,
ArcelorMittal expects the pick-up in underlying demand to continue, supported
by the strength of the automotive end market, but apparent demand is expected
to be modest at +0.5% to +1.5% in 2017 (versus growth of +3.0% in
2016). In Brazil, following the significant decline in ASC in 2016 (-13.8%)
ASC is expected to grow by +3.0% to +4.0% in 2017 as the economy mildly
recovers as consumer confidence returns. In the CIS, following an ASC
decline of -3.8% in 2016, the region should stabilize in 2017 with ASC similar
to 2016 levels (-0.5% to +0.5%). In China, following ASC growth of +1.3% in
2016, demand is expected to stabilise in 2017 (decline of around 0% to -1.0%).

Capex spend in 2017 is expected to increase to $2.9
billion (from $2.4 billion in 2016) as the Group seeks to capitalize on
opportunities to grow value and returns. In addition, interest expense is
expected to decline to $0.9 billion (as compared to $1.1 billion in FY 2016); while
cash taxes and contributions to fund pensions are expected to increase by a
total of $0.2 billion. As a result, the Company expects the cash needs of the
business in 2017 to increase to $5.0 billion (from $4.5 billion in 2016).

Appendix 7:
1:3 Share consolidation / Reverse Stock split


At the Extraordinary General
Meeting held on May 10, 2017, the ArcelorMittal Shareholders approved a share
consolidation based on a ratio 1:3, whereby every three current shares will be
consolidated into one share (with a change in the number of shares outstanding
and the accounting par value per share).
The table below
presents the weighted average common shares outstanding and basic and diluted
earnings per share following the share consolidation for the 3 months ended
March 31, 2017 and for the 3 months ended December 31, September 30, June 30
and March 31, 2016 recast for comparative purposes.

Appendix 8: Terms and definitions


Unless
indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this
earnings release report to the following terms have the meanings set out next
to them below:


LTIF:
lost time injury
frequency rate equals lost time injuries per 1,000,000 worked hours, based on
own personnel and contractors.


EBITDA:
operating income plus
depreciation, impairment expenses and exceptional income/(charges).


Exceptional
income / (charges): 
relate
to transactions that are significant, infrequent or unusual and are not
representative of the normal course of business such as restructuring costs or
asset disposals.


Cash
and cash equivalents: 
represents
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments


Net
debt:
long-term debt, plus short term debt less cash and cash equivalents


Gross
debt
:
long-term debt, plus short term debt (including those held as part of
liabilities held for sale).


Market-priced
tonnes:
represent amounts of iron ore and coal from ArcelorMittal mines that could be
sold to third parties on the open market. Market-priced tonnes that are not
sold to third parties are transferred from the Mining segment to the Company’s
steel producing segments and reported at the prevailing market price. Shipments
of raw materials that do not constitute market-priced tonnes are transferred
internally and reported on a cost-plus basis.


Foreign
exchange and other net financing (loss) / gain:
include foreign currency
exchange impact, bank fees, interest on pensions, impairments of financial
instruments, revaluation of derivative instruments and other charges that
cannot be directly linked to operating results. 


Average
steel selling prices:
calculated as steel sales divided by steel shipments.


Mining
segment sales:
i) “External sales”: mined product sold to third parties at market price; ii)
“Market-priced tonnes”: internal sales of mined product to ArcelorMittal
facilities and reported at prevailing market prices; iii) “Cost-plus tonnes” -
internal sales of mined product to ArcelorMittal facilities on a cost-plus
basis. The determinant of whether internal sales are reported at market price
or cost-plus is whether the raw material could practically be sold to third parties
(i.e. there is a potential market for the product and logistics exist to access
that market). 


Working
capital: 
trade
accounts receivable plus inventories less trade and other accounts payable.


Capex:
includes the
acquisition of tangible and intangible assets. 


Seaborne iron ore
reference prices:
refers to iron ore prices for 62% Fe CFR China.


Own
iron ore production:
Includes total of all finished production of fines, concentrate, pellets and
lumps (excludes share of production and strategic long-term contracts).


On-going
projects:
Refer to projects for which construction has begun (excluding various projects
that are under development), even if such projects have been placed on hold
pending improved operating conditions.


EBITDA/tonne:
calculated as EBITDA
divided by total steel shipments.


Steel-only EBITDA:
calculated as EBITDA
less Mining segment EBITDA. 


Steel-only
EBITDA/tonne:
calculated as steel-only EBITDA divided by total steel shipments.


Iron
ore unit cash cost:
includes weighted average pellet and concentrate cost of goods sold across all
mines.


Liquidity:
Cash and
cash equivalents plus available credit lines excluding back-up lines for the
commercial paper program.


Shipments
information at
segment and group level eliminates intra–segment shipments (which are primarily
between Flat/Long plants and Tubular plants) and inter-segment shipments
respectively. Shipments of Downstream Solutions are excluded.


Operating
segments:
The NAFTA segment includes the Flat, Long and Tubular operations of USA, Canada
and Mexico. The Brazil segment includes the Flat operations of Brazil, and the
Long and Tubular operations of Brazil and its neighboring countries including
Argentina, Costa Rica and Venezuela. The Europe segment comprises the Flat,
Long and Tubular operations of the European business, as well as Downstream
Solutions. The ACIS segment includes the Flat, Long and Tubular operations of
Kazakhstan, Ukraine and South Africa. 


YoY
: Refers to
year-on-year.


Free
cash flow
:
Refers to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capex. 


Net
debt/EBITDA:
Refers to Net debt divided by last twelve months EBITDA calculation.


Operating
results: 
Refers
to operating income/(loss).



[1]The financial information in this press
release has been prepared consistently with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union. The interim financial information
included in this announcement has been also prepared in accordance with IFRS
applicable to interim periods, however this announcement does not contain
sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in
International Accounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”. The
numbers in this press release have not been audited. The financial information
and certain other information presented in a number of tables in this press
release have been rounded to the nearest whole number or the nearest decimal.
Therefore, the sum of the numbers in a column may not conform exactly to the
total figure given for that column. In addition, certain percentages presented
in the tables in this press release reflect calculations based upon the underlying
information prior to rounding and, accordingly, may not conform exactly to the
percentages that would be derived if the relevant calculations were based upon
the rounded numbers. This press release also includes certain non-GAAP
financial measures. ArcelorMittal presents EBITDA, and EBITDA/tonne, which are
non-GAAP financial measures and defined in appendix 8, as additional
measurements to enhance the understanding of operating performance. ArcelorMittal
believes such indicators are relevant to describe trends relating to cash
generating activity and provides management and investors with additional
information for comparison of the Company’s operating results to the operating
results of other companies. ArcelorMittal also presents net debt and the ratio
of net debt to EBITDA as an additional measurement to enhance the understanding
of its financial position, changes to its capital structure and its credit assessment.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with and not as an
alternative for, ArcelorMittal's financial information prepared in accordance
with IFRS. Such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures applied by other companies.
[2]On a comparable
basis (considering the sale of long steel producing subsidiaries in the US
(LaPlace and Vinton) in 2Q 2016 and Zaragoza in Spain during 3Q 2016), total
steel shipments for 1Q 2017 of 21.1Mt was 0.9% lower as compared with 21.2Mt
for 1Q 2016.
[3]At the Extraordinary
General Meeting held on May 10, 2017, the ArcelorMittal Shareholders approved a
share consolidation based on a ratio 1:3, whereby every three current shares
will be consolidated into one share (with a change in the number of shares
outstanding and the accounting par value per share). The figures presented for
the basic and diluted earnings per share do not reflect this change and are
prior to the share consolidation. See Appendix 7 for the EPS calculated after
the share consolidation exercise.
[4]China Oriental completed a share placement
to restore the minimum 25% free float as per HKEx listing requirements.
Following the share placement, ArcelorMittal’s interest in China Oriental
decreased from 47% to 39%, as a result of which ArcelorMittal recorded a net
dilution loss of $44 million.
[5]On February 5, 2016 ArcelorMittal announced
it had sold its 35% stake in Gestamp Automoción ("Gestamp") to the majority
shareholder, the Riberas family, for a total cash consideration of €875 million
($971 million) received in June 2016. In addition to the cash consideration,
ArcelorMittal received in 2Q 2016 a payment of $11 million as a 2015 dividend.
[6]On September 28, 2016, ArcelorMittal South
Africa (“AMSA”) announced that it had entered into agreements to implement a
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) transaction which includes: the
issuance of a 17% shareholding in AMSA using a new class of notionally funded
shares to a special purpose vehicle owned by Likamva Resources Proprietary
Limited (Likamva). Likamva has undertaken to introduce broad-based social and
community development organisations as shareholders to hold an effective 5%
interest (of the 17%, leaving Likamva with a 12% shareholding) within 24

[7]ArcelorMittal Mines Canada, otherwise known
as ArcelorMittal Mines and Infrastructure Canada
[8]On June 23, 2016, following the ratification
by the United Steelworkers of a new labor agreement which is valid until
September 1, 2018, ArcelorMittal made changes mainly to healthcare post-retirement
benefits in its subsidiary ArcelorMittal USA (NAFTA). The changes resulted in a
gain of $832 million recorded in 2Q 2016.
[9]On December 16, 2016, ArcelorMittal signed a
€350 million finance contract with the European Investment Bank in order to
finance European research, development and innovation projects over the
2017-2020 period within the European Union, predominantly France, Belgium and
Spain, but also in the Czech Republic, Poland, Luxembourg and Romania. The
Company benefits from a guarantee from the European Union under the European
Fund for Strategic Investments.
[10]On December 21, 2016,
ArcelorMittal signed an agreement for a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility
(the "Facility"). This Facility amends and restates the $6 billion
revolving credit facility dated April 30, 2015. The amended agreement
incorporates a first tranche of $2.3 billion maturing on December 21, 2019, and
a second tranche of $3.2 billion maturing on December 21, 2021. The Facility
may be used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, the $5.5
billion revolving credit facility remains fully available.
[11]Assets and
liabilities held for sale, as of March 31, 2017, include the carrying value of
the USA long product facilities at Steelton (“Steelton”). Assets and
liabilities held for sale, as of December 31, 2016, include the carrying value
Steelton and some activities of ArcelorMittal downstream solutions in the
Europe segment and America’s Tailored Blanks. 
[12]The comparative
amounts as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified to conform with the
presentation as of December 31, 2016 in the annual report.

Our strategy
ArcelorMittal’s success is built on its core values of sustainability, quality and leadership. Our strategy is to leverage four distinctive attributes:

Global scale and scope
Unmatched technical capabilities
Diverse portfolio of steel and related businesses, particularly mining
Financial capability

Three themes
Steel. We look to extend our leadership in attractive markets by leveraging our technical capabilities and our global scale. These are critical differentiators for sophisticated customers, such as those in the automotive, energy and infrastructure markets. In addition, we will further develop steel businesses that benefit from favourable market structures or geographies.
Mining. We are working to grow our already world-class mining business by expanding our top-quality assets, by controlling cost and capital expenditure and by producing highly-valued products.
Operations. We strive to achieve best-in-class competitiveness. Operational excellence, including health and safety, is at the core of our strategy. We steadily optimise our asset base and have a commitment to continuous improvement.
Five key strategic enablers
A clear licence to operate. Many of our businesses are located in regions in the early stages of economic development. We recognise that we have an obligation to act responsibly towards all stakeholders. Sustainability is one of our core values.
A strong balance sheet. Our balance sheet currently constrains our flexibility for funding organic growth or acquisitions. Achieving the medium-term target for net debt of US$15 billion remains a critical objective.
A decentralised structure. Our scale and scope give us a competitive advantage. They also bring the risk of inefficiency and diffuse accountability. Thus we favour a structure in which the responsibility for profit and loss is focused on business units aligned with markets.
Active portfolio management. We have historically sought to strengthen the business through acquisition. That remains the case. But we are also willing to dispose of businesses that cannot meet our performance standards.
The best talent. Our success will depend on the quality of our people, and our ability to engage, motivate and reward them. We will continue to improve our processes to attract, develop and retain the best talent.
