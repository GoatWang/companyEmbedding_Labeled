From Yesteryear to Hereafter…

GYSCOAL GROUP – The Stainless Steel & Mild Steel 
                    Manufacturer, was established in the late ’90s. From 
                    iron-ore & stainless scrap to manufacturing diverse structural 
                    products in Stainless Steel and Mild Steel, Gyscoal has come 
                    a long way. The group has achieved for itself a pre- eminent 
                    position in the value-added product segment of the Indian 
                    steelindustry. 

Gyscoal Alloys Limited (GAL), a public limited company, 
                    was incorporated in the year 1999 as a private limited company. 
                    Initially, the Company started its business with the trading 
                    of iron and steel scraps, billets and steel long products. 
                    The company also decided to trade in mild steel products namely 
                    CTD Bars and TMT Bars. The company took over a steel rolling 
                    mill business from Shah Alloys Group at Ubkhal, Mehsana and 
                    started manufacturing of rolled products in the year 2005. 
                    The Company further started its Steel Melting Shop with a 
                    capacity of 12,000 MT per annum which was further increased 
                    to 18,000 MT per annum in the year 2008-09. Looking to the 
                    potential higher value addition in case of stainless steel 
                    products, the Company decided to manufacture Stainless Steel 
                    long Products. At present, the plant has the capacity to manufacture 
                    different grades of Stainless Steel products ranging between 
                    200 series to 400 series.

                    Steel industry, Mr. Viral encouraged its team to acquire new 
                    skills & brought in new technologies to give its patronage 
                    better products.

New directions and new objectives have come along our 
                    walk during the years. However, ensuring our customers finest 
                    quality products, timely delivery & after sales services 
                    are some precepts that have been intact over the period of 
                    time. Gyscoal Group, having Strategic Manufacturing Facilities, 
                    Grueling Quality Control Procedures and Marketing Alliances 
                    with industry leaders is on its way to be a major global player. 
                    By March 2006, the group is anticipating its turnover to cross 
                    Rs. 6500 lac mark.

AdvantagesSteel has numerous benefits over other metals. Being used in several industries & day-to-day lifestyle, Steel has come a long way because of its advantages. Some of them are:   Resistance from Corrosion Alloys having lower grades resist corrosion in saturated water environments whereas alloys having higher grades can resist corrosion in most of the acids, alkaline solvents and environments having chlorine.  Resistance from Fire & Heat  Some Nickel-Alloyed and high chromium grades are resistant from scaling and also retain strength at high temperatures.  Hygienic Lineament Hospitals, laboratories, kitchens & other food processing plants where strict hygiene is maintained, prefer stainless steel because of its easy cleaning ability.  Aesthetic Value Stainless Steel having a bright and conveniently maintained surface gives a modern and attractive finish to the product.  Strength Value Austenitic steel has the property of hardening that results in the strengthening of the material. This allows reduction of material thickness over usual grades and hence helps in cost-deduction.  Fabrication Ease With advanced techniques of steel making it is easier to cut, weld, form, machine or fabricate steel.  Resistance from Impact The Austenitic micro-structure of the 300 series is such, that provides high toughness from advanced temperatures. This eventuates in making the steel to suit freezing applications.  Value for Long-Run When we consider the costs of total life cycle of products, stainless steel is usually the least expensive material available for the same.
