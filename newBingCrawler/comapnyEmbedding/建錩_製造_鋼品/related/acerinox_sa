Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.

ACERINOX is known worldwide as the one of the most competitive group in the world in stainless steel manufacturing. From its constitution, it has carried out a continuous program of investments, with development of own technological innovations that, in some cases, has constituted a true landmark in the technology of stainless steel.
In production capacity, ACERINOX is the first world producer, with a melting output of 3.5 million Mt. It is formed by three flat products fully integrated production sites: Acerinox Europa, the Factory of El Campo de Gibraltar (Spain, established in 1970), the first one in producing more than one million tons per year (2001), North American Stainless, N.A.S. (Kentucky, USA, established in 1990), also fully integrated since February 2002, and finally Columbus Stainless (Middelburg, South Africa) that became part of the ACERINOX in the year 2002.
In February 2008 ACERINOX decided to carry out the new project in Malaysia. This decision taken after a thorough feasibility study, which included different alternatives, resulted in the construction of an integrated production plant in Johor Bahru, next to Singapore.  
The project in its last stage will be a stainless steel integrated plant with 1 million Mt melting capacity and 600,000 Mt cold rolling capacity. Phase I is in operation since January 2012 and Phase II since first quarter of 2013.
In long products, Roldan, S.A. (Ponferrada, Spain), the very modern long products factory of N.A.S. (Kentucky, USA), inaugurated in 2002, and Inoxfil, S.A. (Igualada, Spain), are also leading international companies in terms of competitiveness of their production structure.
With this excellent production structure, ACERINOX reaffirms its leadership in competitiveness, having four of the most competitive factories in the world in four different continents.
Thanks to the extensive commercial network, with companies in 36 countries, ACERINOX achieves a worldwide active presence, selling in more than 80 countries.
