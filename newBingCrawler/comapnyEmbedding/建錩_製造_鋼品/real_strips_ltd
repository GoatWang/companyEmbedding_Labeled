5.0 out of 5 starsPleasantly surprised!!ByAmazon Customeron June 19, 2016This was my first time trying nail polish strips and I was very pleased with the product. I typically don't do manicures as they do not last long. If I do, I will do shellac. However, even this is expensive and difficult to remove. I never do regular nail polish because regardless if I use a good base and top coat, it chips within 2-3 days. When I saw these nail polish strips, I read enough favorable reviews to give them a try.The strips do take some practice to apply correctly. They do have some stretch, which can be helpful if you are trying to cover the whole nail. However, be careful if you are trying to remove and readjust, as they can warp and even tear. I actually had to do this a few times but will gentle traction, I was able to maintain the strip without tears.As you can see on day 1, I got good nail coverage and had a decent application, despite being my first try. I would suggest putting a clear top coat on, as this will prolong the life of the manicure. I put a clear top coat on with the initial application, then additional costs about every 2 days.On Day 7, my manicure is going strong. There are a few places of minor lifting of polish at some of the nail beds. There is some slight wearing away of polish at the tips of the nails, but it is so uniform it's hardly noticeable. The amazing thing is I have had absolutely NO chipping! And I have not been gentle on these nails - I have continued to do my normal daily activities - dishes, scrubbing kitchen counters, laundry, etc. I still have a beautiful and almost completely intact manicure after one week.I would definitely recommend this product and have already bought another set to use again in the future.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsHighly recommendByJennaon May 21, 2016Verified PurchaseThese are wonderful. They are very easy to put on, and I am very bad at this stuff! I was able to get them on smoothly and get them to look nice. They lasted a lot longer than my nail polish ever has. Overall, I was very surprised at  house easy these were to put on, how good they looked and how long they lasted. I debated on whether or not these were worth the cost, compared to plain nail polish. I definitely feel that they were worth it and will buy more. Not only do they last longer than traditional nail polish, you can get cute designs that you'd never be able to do with nail polish! Highly recommend them!0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsLove these strips!ByCharlene Hokeon June 24, 2016Verified PurchaseI love these stickers because they are easier to apply than real polish and I don't have to add a topcoat the first day. I use it on day two to extend the life of the polish, and then every othe day. I get at least ten days and sometimes over two weeks of wear. Love these and Amazon has best price by far.0Comment|

It was actually the growth from my nails that made me take them off. I do a lot of wood working and other activities that are not gentle on nails. These seemed to hold up.11 comment|

4.0 out of 5 starsI love these and recently stores have really limited the variety ...ByMaddyon January 14, 2016I love these and recently stores have really limited the variety they carry. Every store I go to seems to have the same 5 designs of which I only like one so I turned to amazon. Not only can you find a large variety of them, they are also cheaper. These are one of my go to designs and I love it, I ALWAYS get compliments on them. Though I can never get them to last as long as they claim, they are easier to apply then jam berry and there is no dry time. On top of that my nails look great for a few days with no salon or wet nails (I'm not very good at letting nail polish dry) and that is totally worth it to me!
