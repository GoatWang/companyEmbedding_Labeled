Hyundai Steel Co., Ltd, or HSC (formerly known as Hyundai INI Steel, and before that, Incheon Iron & Steel Co., Ltd.) is a steel making company headquartered in Incheon and Seoul, South Korea, and a member of the Hyundai-Kia Motor Group. Established in 1953, it is the oldest steel making company in Korea.
Hyundai Steel is the world's second largest EAF steel producer. Hyundai Steel produces a wide variety of products ranging from its high quality H-beams to reinforcing bars. Currently, Hyundai Steel operates six factories: in the Incheon, Dangjin, Pohang, Suncheon, Ulsan provinces of Korea and in China's Chungdo province.
In addition to Hyundai Steel, the Hyundai-Kia Motor group includes steel companies such as, Hyundai Special Steel and BNG Steel Co., Ltd. (formerly Sammi Steel Co., Ltd.). Hyundai Steel uses the EAF process to manufacture steel while BNG is cold rolling mills.
Hyundai Steel, in 2004, had purchased the facilities of the defunct Hanbo Steel in Dangjin. They have taken the once rundown steel company and has refurnished and revitalised its facilities to make it one of the most efficient steel plants in Korea. Currently HSC is operating 3 blast furnaces at Dangjin. The total annual capacity of the company reaches 24 million tonnes per annum[2] and the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group will become the only car maker with an in-house steel mill to supply steel sheets for the production of automobiles.

Hyundai Steel Co., Ltd, or HSC (formerly known as Hyundai INI Steel, and before that, Incheon Iron & Steel Co., Ltd.) is a steel making company headquartered in Incheon and Seoul, South Korea, and a member of the Hyundai-Kia Motor Group. Established in 1953, it is the oldest steel making company in Korea.
Hyundai Steel is the world's second largest EAF steel producer. Hyundai Steel produces a wide variety of products ranging from its high quality H-beams to reinforcing bars. Currently, Hyundai Steel operates six factories: in the Incheon, Dangjin, Pohang, Suncheon, Ulsan provinces of Korea and in China's Chungdo province.
In addition to Hyundai Steel, the Hyundai-Kia Motor group includes steel companies such as, Hyundai Special Steel and BNG Steel Co., Ltd. (formerly Sammi Steel Co., Ltd.). Hyundai Steel uses the EAF process to manufacture steel while BNG is cold rolling mills.
Hyundai Steel, in 2004, had purchased the facilities of the defunct Hanbo Steel in Dangjin. They have taken the once rundown steel company and has refurnished and revitalised its facilities to make it one of the most efficient steel plants in Korea. Currently HSC is operating 3 blast furnaces at Dangjin. The total annual capacity of the company reaches 24 million tonnes per annum[2] and the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group will become the only car maker with an in-house steel mill to supply steel sheets for the production of automobiles.

History[edit]
Hyundai Hysco was established under the name Kyung-il Industrial Co., Ltd. in 1975. The company was renamed to Hyundai Pipe Co., Ltd. in 1980 soon after the completion of its full-scale steel pipe plant in 1979. As a scheme to be a leading steel company in the global market, the company was renamed once again to Hyundai Hysco in February 2001.
In November 1982, two years after the steel pipe plant was built, Hyundai Hysco was awarded the 'US$100 Million Export Tower' in November 1982. In 1997, the company set a new record in the steel industry by producing over 10 million tons of steel pipes.
For over 20 years, Hyundai Hysco has been the leading company in the Korean steel pipe industry. After taking the largest market share in the steel pipe industry, they entered the market for cold rolled products, which require the highest level of technology among other sectors of the steel industries. Hyundai Hysco has begun the commercial production of cold rolled products in April 1999. Since then, Hyundai Hysco set numerous records in the area of cold rolling, rewriting the history of Korean steel industries. Hyundai Hysco's achievements include the building of a full capacity system in less than one year from the commencement of commercial production and producing 5 million tons of automotive steel products in five years. In 2004, Hyundai Hysco took over an old and standtill works, Hanbo Steel, in Dangjin, in a consortium with Hyundai Steel. By taking over the old and abandoned works and successfully completing the normalization in 2006, Hyundai Hysco not only build the 4 million tons of cold rolling capacity per year, but also contributed to the Korean economy.
Hyundai Hysco now operates Global Steel Service Center, Automotive Parts Business, Steel Pipe Products,and Resource Development as four core business after partial merger with Hyundai Steel in 2013.

Company Description: 
 Established in 1953, Hyundai Steel is the oldest/most experienced steel making company in Korea and is currently one of the major companies of the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group.
  

 In addition to Hyundai Steel, the Hyundai-Kia Autmotive group includes steel companies such as, Hyundai Hysco (formerly known as Hyundai Steel Pipe Co., Ltd.) and BNG Steel Co., Ltd. (formerly Sammi Steel Co., Ltd.). Hyundai Steel uses the EAF process to manufacture steel while BNG and Hyundai Hysco are cold rolling mills.
  

 Hyundai Steel, in 2004, had purchased the facilities of the defunted Hanbo Steel in Dangjin. They have taken the once rundown steel company and has refurnished and revitalised its facilities to make it one of the most efficient steel plants in Korea. Currently HSC is planning to create Korea's second BOF steel mill. Once Hyundai Steel completes its BOF steel mill in Dangjin, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group will become the only car maker with an in-house steel mill to supply steel sheets for the production of automobiles.
