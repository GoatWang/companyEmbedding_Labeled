				Steel Flower received the US$200million Export Tower from KITA(Korea International Trade Association) at the nation¡¯s 49th Trade Day - which was held on December 5th, last year - for its contribution to the nation¡¯s export growth. It marked the company¡¯s recent second remarkable achievement after being awarded the US$ 100million Export Tower in 2009. As the infrastructure establishment of energy industry such as oil, natural gas, sea wind power is increasingly important, manufacturing of highest-quality steel pipe - it is far thicker than general one and being applied as oil pipe line, drilling
pipe, and as pillar of massive architecture - is also emerging as very hot business among steel makers. The worldwide demand of high-quality steel pipe is increasingly depends on the global dependence of nuclear power plant, chemical plant, etc. ¡°Earlier this year, we started exporting of 1,500 tons structural steel pipes to Singapore. We further plans to add export
destinations such as the U.S., the EU, Asia, the Middle East, etc. expanding our global market presence gradually,¡± said an
official of the company. Domestically, Steel Flower made a strategic alliance with POSCO, the global leading total steel maker, heightening the chance of significantly enhancing the manufacturing capability of high-quality steel pipes continuously. Since 2002, Steel Flower has been a major manufacturer of heavy-wall-thickness-steel-pipes in South Korea for offshore and construction purposes. The company produces pipes that fully comply with HIC and SSCC requirements in accordance with international NACE standards as per MR-0175, TM0177, TM0284 and ISO3183. The venture, which has production capacity of 16,600 tons of pipes on a monthly basis, is actively supplying superb products and related services that can satisfy requirements of the most demanding international specifications such as TOTAL, SHELL, AGIP, NIGC, etc, which proved to be the best standard for tolerance in the world.
Many oil companies operating all over the world mostly prefer to use the pipes for their specific industrial applications -
major projects offshore & onshore, petrochemical, power plants, power plants and line pipe industries.
As part of its strenuous efforts for global recognition, the company has so far obtained many international certifications
such as ISO 9001, API 2B, API 5L (PSL 1) in 2003, ASME in 2008, PED (97/23/EC) in 2009 and OHSAS 18001 IN 2010,
respectively. With the adoption of MES(Manufacturing Execution System) on every process, it thus allows itself to effectively
oversee and control the entire processes including the manufacturing process, quality control, management, and product
history. With the aim of steadily increasing its global market share, the company is further mulling over innovative ways to
accomplish its goal in worldwide market. Wider spectrum of cooperation with global potential ventures naturally included.
The current major business partners include the UAE, the U.S., India, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
