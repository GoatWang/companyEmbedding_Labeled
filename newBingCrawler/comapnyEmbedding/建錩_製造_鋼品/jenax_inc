Flexible Lithium Polymer Battery
Technologies with new form factors, wearables, and future
devices cannot be achieved with traditonal batteries. J.Flex,
an innovative flexbile battery by Jenax, meets these challenges
by freeing design limitations without sacrificing power.

Strengths

Gel polymer electrolyte
Rapid movement of lithium ion
No overheating
High energy density
Low internal resistance
Stable even with bending fatigue


Benefits
1. FLEXIBILITY
J.Flex can be bent or rolled to enhance the flexibility of next generation devices. From IT to healthcare and fashion, J.Flex supports a range of
industries that are using advanced technologies to add new design, comfort, and efficiency to their devices.

The test below tracks the charge and discharge performance of batteries in two different states:
1. Non-bending

2. Dynamic bending (10,000 bends from flat to 20mm in radius)




2. DESIGN


Creative designs are often hindered due to lack of components that
support the designer’s vision for the product. With J.Flex, a new level
of customization is possible. A designer can now use new shapes and
sizes not otherwise possible without minimizing performance. This
brings out the design’s full potential, and enables entirely new types
of devices that are more functional, discreet, and streamlined.


3. PERFORMANCE
J.Flex ensures outstanding performance for any device.

The tests below are based on a J.Flex cell with the following specifications:
