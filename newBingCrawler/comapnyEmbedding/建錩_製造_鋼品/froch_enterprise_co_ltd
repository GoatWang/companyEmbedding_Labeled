Company Description                    




                        FROCH ENTERPRISE (FROCH) is a specialized manufacturer for stainless steel tube and pipe. Under the leadership of the Chairman, Mr. Ping-Yiao Chang, the company has always followed the ideology of conserving resources and protecting environment. Ever since its establishment, the company continues growing and expanding, and the quality of its products is accredited by numerous organizations, both domestic and international. In 1993, FROCH receives ISO-9001 Quality Management System Approval issued by Lloyds Register Quality Assurance of Britain. The company is also the first stainless steel tube and pipe manufacturer to pass the quality management system in Taiwan. In 1995, FROCH is approved to be a CNS12692 registered manufacturer by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology, and Inspection of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan. In 1999, FROCH receives ISO-14001 Environment Management System Approval issued by Lloyds Register Quality Assurance, and in 2001, the Quality Assurance Laboratory of FROCH was approved by Chinese National Laboratory Accreditation (CNLA), which is a member of International Laboratory Accreditation Corporation (ILAC). Continue on improvement, emphasis on both quality and environment are the business objectives of FROCH, and they are also the trends of the future.FROCH is established in 1984 by the current Chairman, Mr. Ping-Yiao Chang. The company is mainly specialized in producing stainless steel tubes and pipes. Since its establishment, FROCH focuses on the improvement of manufacturing technologies. It believes Pursuing the Excellence and Creating the Future as the fundamental motivation for all developments.In the aspect of product development, FROCH leads among other competitors to develop high-value-added products. Especially in 1997, in order to develop large diameter and thick wall pipe for high-pressure application, the company integrates many specialists from several countries to develop SAW welding. Moreover, to achieve the qualified inspection standard for high-pressure applications, the company obtains Radiographic Examination facility.In the aspect of product range, FROCH provides the most complete product line which can satisfy the various needs from the customers. The material types include ASTM 304, 304L, 316, and 316L, and the size range starts from 1/4 inch to 80 inch. FROCH has become the customers' preferred supplier based on providing full product range. In the aspect of sales network, FROCH is the No. 1 on both domestic and export sales. There are more than 2,000 customers in Taiwan and more than 50 countries for export. The marketing strategy of diversifying markets and customers helps FROCH not being affected severely by one single industry and/or one single market. The top 10 large customers only attain less than 10% of the sales revenue, and this demonstrates the success of diversifying markets and stability of sales channels.Being the pioneer of the industry, FROCH enjoys the most benefit when many public and private projects are in action during the recent years. Stainless steel tube and pipe can be used in many industries, such as petro-chemical, pulp and paper, electronics, logistic, machinery, power plant, and waste water treatment, and FROCH has sufficient raw materials, matured production technology, and qualified by many customers for serious usage to satisfy all different needs from different customers. In the meantime, developing new products and enhancing customer service are the essential factors for FROCH to maintain the leading position of the industry. For the future, for the purpose to bring out the best stainless steel product to the global market, FROCH will continue pursuing the excellence and creating the future.
