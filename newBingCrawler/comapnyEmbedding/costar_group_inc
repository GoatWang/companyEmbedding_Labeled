With organic growth slowing and an acquisition strategy picking up the slack, we think expectations for future profit growth embedded in the stock price have moved beyond what the company can reasonably be expected to achieve. We see an unbalanced risk/reward scenario that does not favor investors. CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is this week’s Danger Zone pick. Acquisitions Drive Growth and Margin Volatility CoStar Group has grown revenue by 18% compounded annually over the past ten years. Most of this growth (86% in dollar terms) has come over the past five years and has been heavily influenced by the acquisition of four real estate listing websites totaling $1.7 billion in deal value. 90% of the $1.7 billion went to goodwill and other intangible assets. After-tax profits (NOPAT) have grown 26% compounded annually over the past decade due to an increase in NOPAT margins from 6% in 2006 to 12% in 2016. NOPAT margin has recovered from 2015’s deep decline, which was driven by high marketing costs to promote newly acquired brands. CSGP now generates a similar NOPAT margin (12%) on $864 million of TTM revenue as it did on $212 million of revenue in 2008 (11%). This lack of meaningful operating leverage should give investors pause when considering the potential for future margin or return on invested capital (ROIC) improvement. Per Figure 1 below, CSGP has failed to earn the cost of capital for over five years. Figure 1: ROIC Is Below WACC  


 Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Free Cash Flow Consumed by Acquisitions Over the past five years, CSGP has burned through $1.2 billion of cumulative free cash flow (FCF), largely due to the acquisition strategy of rolling up commercial real estate and apartment listing websites. More recently, the pace and size of acquisitions have slowed, and FCF has increased to $126 million over the trailing twelve months. Despite this increase, the stock’s 1% FCF Yield remains below the S&P 500 (2%) and its data/information provider peer group (3%). ROIC Depressed by Inefficient Balance Sheet CSGP’s current 6% ROIC is in fourth-quintile of our coverage universe and is well below the data/information provider peer group (median 12% ROIC) and the S&P 500 (18% ROIC). At first glance, CSGP’s low returns seem counterintuitive given a NOPAT margin (12%) in the top-half of S&P 500 companies and NOPAT growth of 26% compounded annually over the past decade. However, while margins look reasonable, the balance sheet does not. Invested capital has increased by 30% compounded annually over the past decade, from just $124 million in 2006 to $1.7 billion today. The exploding balance sheet makes margin improvement well beyond current levels imperative to value creation. If balance sheet efficiency (e.g. invested capital turns (revenue/invested capital)) declines, then margins have to rise enough to offset that decline; otherwise, ROIC declines even if margins rise. Per Figure 2, CSGP generated a 17% ROIC in 2008 with a NOPAT margin of 11% on 1.5 invested capital turns. However, CSGP’s current NOPAT margin of 12% only translates into a 6% ROIC given the decline in invested capital turns to 0.5. Figure 3 displays the significant disconnect between margins and capital turns since the company began the acquisition campaign in 2012.

Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings  ROIC/Valuation Regression Per Figure 4, ROIC explains nearly 80% of the valuation difference among the selected data and information provider peer group. Despite CSGP’s relatively low ROIC (6% vs. 12% median for the peer group), the stock trades at a significant premium as shown by CSGP’s position above the trend line in Figure 3. If CSGP stock were at parity with the group, it would trade at $130/share – 54% below the current price. Figure 4: Correlation Between ROIC & Valuation 

Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Executive Comp Aligned with the Wrong Metrics We know from Figure 3 above, and numerous case studies, that changes in ROIC are directly correlated to changes in market value. Accordingly, we favor executive compensation plans that use ROIC to measure performance to ensure executives’ interests are aligned with shareholders’ interests. Revenue and non-GAAP performance targets can be an incentive to sacrifice profitability for volume, or worse, engage in acquisitions that destroy shareholder value. CSGP executive compensation plans are tied to exceeding their own internal expectations for metrics they define, such as adjusted EBITDA (cash incentives), non-GAAP net income (restricted stock grants) and three-year revenue growth, adjusted for stock price performance (restricted stock grants).
 When the focus shifts from organic growth to acquisitions and non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, it is time for investors to call out management’s self-serving incentive structure. CSGP’s executive compensation plans incentivizes management to invest capital in sub-optimal ROIC endeavors in order to achieve revenue or non-GAAP earnings targets. Per Figure 5, the implications are clear. CSGP has generated $272 million of negative economic earnings over the past five years, while GAAP earnings have risen considerably. Figure 5: Ten-Year GAAP vs. Economic Earnings 

Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Competitive Pressures Likely to Build, Putting Margin Expansion at Risk First mover advantage is imperiled by failing to identify and counter new competition. While much attention has been paid to the explosion of financial technology startups, the rise of real estate technology startups has been less noted. Investors allocated over $1 billion to such firms over the past few years and almost half of the top 100 real estate technology companies are less than five years old. This increasing number of real estate technology startups seems likely to challenge CSGP’s market share or at least its margins. Given that significant margin expansion is required for CSGP to drive ROIC improvement, we view the company’s balance sheet dynamics as a meaningful competitive disadvantage. The bloated balance sheet, and resulting low ratio of invested capital turns, will make it more difficult to counter competitive pressures by competing on price or ramping up investment in new product development. Figure 6: Balance Sheet Inefficiency Represents Competitive Disadvantage 

Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings
 While CSGP is currently generating the highest NOPAT margin (12%) of the past decade, it came one year after posting the lowest (<2%) due to cost containment issues tied to the build out of new initiatives, particularly advertising and promotion costs. Questionable spending continued into 2016, perhaps best characterized by a $5 million Super Bowl ad (featuring rapper Lil Wayne, no less) for a very niche product vs. one with a wide audience. We remain cautious on the level of spending required to maintain revenue momentum, and think market expectations are overly optimistic on potential margin improvement. Bull Case: Based on Hope The Bull Case for CSGP is based on a continuation of solid organic revenue growth in the core commercial real estate (CRE) data business with accelerating revenue growth in the apartment listings business. We are cautious on growth prospects for the core business due to market saturation and are not sold of the long-term prospects of apartment listing websites, a business with naturally low barriers to entry. The market for CRE data is much smaller than the residential side of the market. We believe CSGP has limited upside with the largest CRE firms (C.B. Richard Ellis, Jones Lang LaSalle, etc.) while pricing the product above where many smaller, regional CRE brokerage firms find it an attractive value. The bull case is also predicated on margin expansion due to management’s focus on generating 40% “incremental adjusted EBITDA margins” on new revenue growth. We believe investors should view this flawed metric skeptically and remain focused on NOPAT margins. In order to generate ROIC above the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), CSGP must now generate a higher NOPAT margin than it ever has historically. This challenge requires significant additional revenue without growing expenses or investing significant additional capital. Even if CSGP were to operate at the average NOPAT margin of the five highest performing companies in Figure 4 (a 25% NOPAT margin, over 2x CSGP’s current level), the resulting 13% ROIC would remain well be below the average 24% ROIC generated by the same five companies.
 Bear Case: Classic Poor Risk/Reward Trade-Off The Bear Case for CSGP is based on the combination of extremely high market expectations for future cash flows and the misleading nature of the firm’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings when compared to economic earnings. In addition, the expectation of increased competition for CSGP’s core CRE data products from new market entrants, slowing growth in the core business due to market saturation and the questionable long-term outcome of investing heavily in apartment listing websites add to the bear case. We believe that all of these concerns have merit, but do not believe any necessarily have to go badly against the company for the stock to underperform. As such, CSGP represents a classic poor risk-reward trade off. We prefer to buy stocks with low expectations, and sell stocks with high expectations. The expectations for revenue growth and margin expansion reflected in expectations for CSGP represent a very high bar for organic growth and management execution, and ignore the various risks and economic profit realities of the company’s acquisition activities to date. Is CSGP Worth Acquiring? The proprietary value of the core product (CoStar Suite, 49% of revenue) is debatable while the digital apartment listing business is crowded and competitive with low barriers to entry. While CSGP does operate an array of well trafficked real estate websites, the real engine behind the core database product (CoStar Suite) is the large department of ~1,600 researchers and contractors engaged in labor intensive data collection and manual entry (cold calling, public records searches, field visits, etc.). While CSGP is the dominant player in CRE data and apartment listings, we do not believe CSGP has the kind of proprietary “tech” value that occasionally results in companies selling at nonsensical multiples to much larger acquirers. Could an S&P Global (SPGI) consider beefing up their commercial real estate data offerings via acquiring CSGP? Yes. Could SPGI make economic sense of acquiring CSGP in anything other than a take-under? The math makes it very unlikely, given that a deal for CSGP at the current price would be very dilutive to SPGI’s ROIC from both a NOPAT margin and balance sheet perspective.
 Walking Through the Acquisition Value Math To begin, CoStar Group has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.  $152 million in off-balance-sheet operating leases (2% of market cap) $44 million in outstanding employee stock options (<1% of market cap) $11 million in deferred tax liabilities (<1% of market cap)  After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, CSGP is not worth the current share price. Figures 7 and 8 show what we think S&P Global should pay for CSGP to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. S&P Global could immediately integrate CoStar’s data to bolster its real estate data offerings and bring increased scale to the business. However, there are limits on how much SPGI would pay for CSGP to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired. Each implied price is based on a ‘goal ROIC’ assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals 14%, which is the consensus estimate of revenue growth in the next two years. For the subsequent years, we use 14% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year’s expectations. We use 18% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with SPGI could create revenue growth through increased sales & marketing efforts and a larger customer base. We conservatively assume that S&P Global can grow CoStar’s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume CoStar immediately achieves a 20% NOPAT margin, which is the average of SPGI and CSGP’s current NOPAT margin. For reference, CoStar’s current NOPAT margin is 12%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario. Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices For SPGI To Achieve 7% ROIC  

Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.
 Figure 7 shows the ‘goal ROIC’ for SPGI as its weighted average cost of capital or 7%. Even if CoStar can grow revenue by 16% compounded annually with a 20% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $281/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal SPGI’s WACC. Figure 8: Implied Acquisition Prices For SPGI To Achieve 25% ROIC 

Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.  Figure 8 shows the next ‘goal ROIC’ of 25%, which is SPGI’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to SPGI shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most SPGI should pay for CSGP is $45/share (84% downside). Even assuming this best-case scenario, SPGI would destroy over $7 billion by purchasing SPGI at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 16% CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for SPGI. Very High Expectations Embedded in Valuation Despite consensus expectations for 2017/2018 revenue and EPS being lower now than one year ago, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500, rising 49% YTD and 37% over the last year. At the current price, we believe CSGP’s valuation embeds a dangerous level of market expectations due to the chasm between historical financial performance and the expected performance implied by its market value. To justify its current price of $281/share, CSGP must maintain current NOPAT margins of 12% and grow NOPAT by 13% compounded annually for the next 23 years. In this scenario, CSGP would be generating over $15 billion in annual revenue, over 2.5x S&P Global’s current revenue. The market for CSGP’s current products is simply not large enough for such a scenario to be plausible.
 Even if we assume CSGP can more than double its NOPAT margin to 25% (the average of the top 5 performing companies in Figure 4) and grow NOPAT by 17% annually for the next decade, the stock is still worth only $167 today – a 41% downside risk. This scenario assumes CSGP grows revenues to over $2 billion in ten years from $864 million, or ~10% compounded annually. Each of these scenarios assumes CSGP is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and free cash flow without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely (particularly in light of Figure 3) but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are. CSGP Offers No Yield to Shareholders CSGP does not currently pay a cash dividend nor have a buyback program in place. As such, the stock offers none of the downside protection that a solid shareholder yield can provide. Given the level of risk we see in the valuation and forward expectations, this downside protection could be sorely missed. Insider Trading and Short Interest Trends Insiders own 3.7% of outstanding shares, including a 0.5% interest held by CEO Florance. Ownership has been diluted by acquisition issuance over time while insiders have been steady net sellers for well over a decade. Insiders owned 1.8 million shares or 10.3% in 2004 compared to 1.2 million today. We could not find a single open-market purchase by an insider over the same period. Short interest is not high at 3% of outstanding shares or 5.6 days to cover. The level of short interest has bounced around from 2% to 6% over the past few years. Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to CoStar Group’s 2016 10-K:
 Income Statement: we made $42 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $12 million in non-operating expense (1% of revenue). We removed $27 million related to non-operating expenses and $15 million related to non-operating income. See all the adjustments made to CSGP’s income statement here. Balance Sheet: we made $767 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $319 million. One of the most notable adjustments was $152 million (7% of reported net assets) related to off-balance sheet operating leases. See all adjustments to CSGP’s balance sheet here.  Valuation: we made $1 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $28 million. Apart from $456 million in total debt, which includes the operating leases noted above, the most notable adjustment to shareholder value was $44 million in outstanding employee stock options. This stock options adjustment represents <1% of CSGP’s market cap. Dangerous Funds That Hold CSGP The following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to CSGP.

	PRESS RELEASE DETAIL


Sep 19, 2012
CoStar Group’s PPR Division Launches Expanded, Comprehensive Multi-Family Product
Washington, DC – September 19, 2012 – CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP),  commercial real estate's leading provider of information, analytics and marketing services, today announced its Property & Portfolio Research (PPR) division has launched an expanded multi-family product powered by CoStar’s industry-leading commercial property database.
 Washington, DC – September 19, 2012 – CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP),  commercial real estate's leading provider of information, analytics and marketing services, today announced its Property & Portfolio Research (PPR) division has launched an expanded multi-family product powered by CoStar’s industry-leading commercial property database. CoStar tracks detailed information on almost 400,000 multi-family properties in 210 U.S. markets and has been building the most comprehensive database of multi-family properties in the industry. The Company has established a dedicated team of 40 individuals that is specializing in the research and verification of multi-family information.   Along with independent research, analytics and actionable insights provided by PPR’s team of over 40 economists, the PPR multi-family product is designed to meet the information and analytics needs of PPR’s clients, including commercial banks, financial institutions, pension funds, insurance companies and government and rating agencies. “We believe the unparalleled combination of strong analytics from PPR coupled with CoStar’s unmatched, comprehensive data gives our clients who are interested in multi-family an outstanding resource for analyzing properties,” said Andrew C. Florance, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CoStar. CoStar has already expanded its detailed coverage on more than 25,000 multi-family properties, with information on unit count, unit size, asking rent, effective rent and vacancy. The number of properties with expanded information is expected to grow rapidly over the next 12 months and beyond. “With coverage of 210 markets, PPR plans to provide insight into the vast majority of U.S. cities, not just the big markets,” said Hans Nordby, Managing Director of PPR.  “This is a key point for lenders, who often serve a wide geographic footprint, as well as investors, who are investing in smaller cities.” “From an analytics perspective, we are going where no apartment research group has gone before,” Nordby continued.  “We expect to offer effective rent estimates, including forecasts at the metro and sub-market level, as well as demographic and demand driver screens at the street corner level, leveraging CoStar data that simply is not available elsewhere.”   About PPR Property and Portfolio Research (PPR) provides unparalleled expertise and objective thinking in analyzing and forecasting commercial real estate markets. PPR sets the pace in offering independent research, a unique set of analytic tools, and actionable insights to investors on hundreds of global markets in North America and Europe. Clients range from commercial banks and financial institutions to pension funds and insurance companies as well as government and rating agencies. With a dedicated commitment to providing the best in commercial real estate research, PPR's widely respected knowledge of the markets helps clients to stay ahead of market trends, act decisively, and feel confident about their investment decisions. PPR is a division of CoStar Group. About CoStar Group, Inc. CoStar Group (NASDAQ: CSGP) is commercial real estate's leading provider of information, analytics and marketing services. Founded in 1987, CoStar conducts expansive, ongoing research to produce and maintain the largest and most comprehensive database of commercial real estate information.

For more information, visit www.costar.com.     This news release includes "forward-looking statements" including, without limitation, statements regarding CoStar's expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. These statements are based upon current beliefs and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. The following factors, among others, could cause or contribute to such differences: the risk that the number of properties with expanded information does not grow rapidly over the next 12 months and beyond; the possibility that the product will be modified and therefore does not provide the details, services or coverage outlined in this release, including coverage of the vast majority of U.S. cities or effective rent estimates and forecast services at the metro and sub-market level; and the risk that the product does not launch when expected.  More information about potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar's filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including CoStar's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and CoStar's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, under the heading "Risk Factors" section of each of these filings. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date hereof, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.'

CoStar Group, Inc. is the largest provider of information services to commercial real estate professionals in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The company employs approximately 1,300 people worldwide, including the largest professional research organization in the industry.

�         Training CoStar employees to understand the value of energy efficiency, green building attributes, and the value of ENERGY STAR qualified buildings.
�         Heightening awareness about the connection between commercial building asset values and energy efficiency within the commercial real estate industry by sponsoring a study on how ENERGY STAR and the U.S. Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System affect key property metrics such as occupancy, rental rates, and sale prices.
�         Educating more than 75,000 brokers, owners, builders, architects, lenders, manufacturers, and developers - and by extension their corporate clients - about ENERGY STAR through CoStar information services, articles, and numerous presentations at industry conferences.

CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) reported second-quarter results on July 26. The provider of commercial real estate analytics and online marketplaces beat its own expectations for sales growth, prompting it to boost its revenue and earnings forecast for the year ahead.

What happened with CoStar Group this quarter? 
Companywide bookings jumped 39% year over year to a record $37 million, fueled in part by CoStar's efforts to expand its sales force, as founder and CEO Andrew Florance explained during a conference call with analysts:

We've had a strong start to 2017 in sales, as we've achieved $71 million of net bookings in the first half of the year, up 26% from the same year-to-date period in the year prior. We're clearly benefiting from the impact of our investment into our larger sales organization, which increased in size by 40% compared to the beginning of last year.

These investments also helped to boost CoStar's revenue, which increased 15% to $237 million. The company saw growth in all of its major product lines, including CoStar Suite (up 13%), commercial property and land marketplaces (up 17%), and Apartments.com (up 24%).
CoStar's growth investments did, however, weigh on its profits. EBITDA -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, and certain other items -- fell 3% to $54 million. And adjusted (non-GAAP) net income declined 4% to $28 million, or $0.86 per share.





Looking forward
These results prompted CoStar to raise its full-year 2017 financial guidance. Revenue is now expected to be between $954 million and $960 million, up from a previous forecast of $945 million and $955 million. And non-GAAP EPS is projected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.52, versus prior estimates of $4.30 to $4.40.
In addition, CoStar said it remains on track to reach its goal of achieving a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin by the end of 2018.
"We achieved an excellent first half of 2017 as our investments into the business, along with tremendous execution on all levels by the CoStar team, resulted in remarkable increases in sales and revenue growth," Florance added. "We have excellent momentum heading into the second half of this year."
