Downstream operations; including fuels marketing and the manufacture and marketing of lubricantsMobil Producing Nigeria is a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation and the second largest oil producer in Nigeria. Mobil Oil Nigeria is a publicly traded company listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
Our two upstream subsidiaries have a long history of operations in Nigeria and have significant oil & natural gas production and a leadership exploration position in the deepwater offshore Nigeria. The companies' operations are one of the largest sources of revenue for the Nigerian government and the economy. There are approximately 1900 ExxonMobil employees with Nigerians representing 96% of the work force. Company headquarters is located in Lagos.Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPN)
Mobil Producing Nigeria began operations in Nigeria in 1955 under the name Mobil Exploration Nigeria Incorporated and was incorporated as Mobil Producing Nigeria on June 16, 1969. Production of crude oil began in February 1970 from the Idoho field, located off the coast of Akwa Ibom State.
Mobil Producing Nigeria is the operator of the joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and holds a 40% participating interest. MPN is the only major oil company operating completely offshore; with no onshore production. The company holds over 800,000 acres in shallow water offshore southeastern Nigeria. Production comes from 90 offshore platforms, with 283 flowing completions in 353 wells with a production capacity of about 720,000 barrels of crude, condensate and natural gas liquid (NGL) a day. Of the current total liquid production, 94 kbd is condensate from the OSO field, which is exempt from OPEC quota restrictions. MPN also produces 45 kbd of NGL at the OSO NGL platform under a separate agreement, where it holds a 51% interest in partnership with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.The East Area Project is designed to gather gas from all MPN fields, compress, extract NGL and inject lean gas for additional recovery of about 800 MOEB.The Yoho Field Development Project is a shallow water development of Yoho and Awawa reservoirs to recover about 400 MBO at a production rate of 150 KBD.
ExxonMobil also has a production sharing contract with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in the development of the Erha major deepwater oil and gas discovery (ExxonMobil interest 56.25%). Field development will be via subsea wells flowing into a floating production, storage and offloading system. Bonga will also include a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel with subsea producers and injector in 3,300 feet of water. Target production is 200,000 barrels of oil and 150 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. ExxonMobil has equity share of 20% in Bonga field operated by Shell.
In January 2002, ExxonMobil announced a 20% working interest Bolia; a significant deepwater oil discovery offshore Nigeria.Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited (EEPNL)
Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited (EEPNL) was established in 1993 as an affiliate of the Exxon Corporation.
EEPNL and other Esso subsidiaries hold interests in six deepwater blocks covering 3.2 million acres, which gives them the second largest deepwater offshore acreage position in Nigeria.
The Company is the operator of the Erha project. This is a deepwater license (3400 feet) and the location of a major oil and gas discovery. Erha's target production rate is 150 kbd and it is expected to produce about 500 million barrels of the oil (gross). Start-up is scheduled for 2005. EEPNL has a 56% interest in the Erha project. The remaining 44 percent is held by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO). Commercialization of gas resources holds promise, utilizing proprietary ExxonMobil technology.

Bonga has a target production rate of 200 kbd of liquids and 150 mcfd of gas and is expected to produce about 560 million oil-equivalent barrels (gross).

Research and Markets has exceptional standards in terms of customer service. Stephen was my contact since

                         an initial enquiry last October. He never failed to reply promptly and efficiently. The information provided has always been clear and to the point. This quality of service extends to Thomas at the Orders Department. I will be happy to order publications from Research and Markets again if the situation arises.
