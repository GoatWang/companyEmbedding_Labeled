The OpenFog Consortium (OpenFog) is a public-private ecosystem formed to accelerate the adoption of fog computing in order to solve the bandwidth, latency and communications challenges associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, the Tactile Internet and other advanced concepts in the digitized world. It was founded by ARM, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University Edge Computing Laboratory in November 2015.
Our work is centered around creating a framework for efficient & reliable networks and intelligent endpoints combined with identifiable, secure, and privacy-friendly information flows between clouds, endpoints, and services based on open standard technologies. OpenFog members represent the leading thinkers and innovators in fog computing, who have come together to help build the foundational elements for this emerging area.
Among the challenges that we are collectively addressing are high latency on the network, support of end point mobility, loss of connectivity, unpredictable bandwidth bottlenecks and distributed coordination of systems and clients. Our technical workgroups are creating an OpenFog architecture that enables end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out computation, communication, control and storage.
The work of OpenFog is done through its Committees and Workgroups, overseen by a 15-person Board of Directors. OpenFog shares selected pre-publication work with industry associations through formal liaison and affiliation agreements. Its published work is posted under resources and is available for industry use.

Frequently Asked Questions




Japanese Version
 
Why was the OpenFog Consortium formed? What problems are you hoping to solve?
A: Fog computing is the missing link to accelerate IoT.  It spans the continuum from Cloud to Things in order to bring compute, control, storage and networking closer to where the data is being generated.
The sheer breadth and scale of IoT solutions requires collaboration at a number of levels, including hardware, software across edge and cloud as well as the protocols and standards that enable all of our “things” to communicate. Existing infrastructures simply can’t keep up with the data volume and velocity created by IoT devices, nor meet the low latency response times required in certain use cases, such as emergency services and autonomous vehicles. The strain on networks from cloud-only or cloud-mostly models will only get worse as IoT applications and devices continue to proliferate.  In addition, the devices themselves are starting to become smarter, allowing for additional control and capabilities closer to where the data is being generated.
The OpenFog Consortium takes existing industry IoT efforts one step farther by concentrating on creating a composability architecture and approach to fog/edge/distributed computing. We are driving closer collaboration between the entire ecosystem of providers who enable IoT solutions and further the development of the IoT market, including creating a reference design that delivers interoperability close to the end devices. Our efforts will define an architecture of distributed computing, network, storage, control and resources that will support intelligence at the edge of IoT, including autonomous and self-aware machines, things, devices, and smart objects. OpenFog members will also identify and develop new operational models. Ultimately, our work will help to enable and drive the next generation of IoT.

What is Fog Computing?
A: Fog computing is a system-level horizontal architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control and networking anywhere along the continuum from Cloud to Things.  By extending the cloud to be closer to the things that produce and act on IoT data, fog enables latency sensitive computing to be performed in proximity to the sensors, resulting in more efficient network bandwidth and more functional and efficient IoT solutions. Fog computing also offers greater business agility through deeper and faster insights, increased security and lower operating expenses.

What are the goals for the OpenFog Consortium?
A: Our goals are related to the technologies, innovation and market potential for fog computing.  On the technical front, OpenFog Consortium workgroups are creating an open architecture for fog computing that is necessary to enable interoperability and scalability.  We are working with our academia and research members to identify, share and apply best practices in advanced technologies around fog computing.  Through a diverse set of members, we are creating an environment where different perspectives and requirements will foster innovation and wide interoperability within the industry.   Just as cloud has created new business models, growth and industries, fog computing can eventually do the same.

Who are the founding members of the OpenFog Consortium?
A: The founding members are ARM, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft Corp., and the Princeton University Edge Laboratory.

Who else is involved in the OpenFog Consortium?
A: OpenFog is an open membership based group, and membership is open to any organization wishing to join us in our mission.  Our members are leading thinkers and innovators in fog computing technologies and applications:  Industry and technology, research and academia, public and private sector.  OpenFog members are headquartered in North America, Europe and Asia.  The full list of members is located here; we have about 50 members today. The full list of members is located here.

Is OpenFog a standards body? Is it a governing body?
A: Neither. Our objective is to influence standard bodies into creating standards so that IoT systems at the edge can interoperate securely with other edge systems and cloud services in a friction-free environment. The objective of the consortium is to establish a framework that the markets can flourish within.  We have an affiliation agreement with IEEE and we will be establishing liaisons with other standards organizations, with the objective of collaborating in the standards creation.

How is OpenFog different from other IoT consortia and the other IoT-related standards groups that are being formed? Aren’t some of these already working to solve these issues?
A: The OpenFog Consortium is the only organization that is focused on fog computing.  While other organizations are taking pieces of it, only OpenFog is addressing all aspects of fog computing across compute, control, access, network and storage.   However, there is much work to be done, and we believe that the right approach is to collaborate with other consortia.  We intend to leverage the technical output of other organizations through formal liaisons to our workgroups, and anticipate that they will similarly incorporate OpenFog architectural frameworks in their work.  To date, we have established formal liaison agreements with IEEE, the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and OPC Foundation, and are holding discussions with additional organizations.

What about collaboration with academia and research organizations?
A: We are working closely with our university members and research groups across the globe on research, development, testing and education.  Our academic members play an active and important role in the Consortium, through their advanced research of fog computing technology concepts in areas such as security, communications and fog nodes.

What industries will benefit most from fog computing?
A: Fog computing will benefit every industry. In Smart Cities, for example, fog technology can bring intelligence to a range of urban services, including transportation, parking, lighting, traffic and waste management, public safety, and law enforcement. In energy, it might take 12 days via satellite to transmit one day’s worth of data to the cloud from a remote oil rig. With fog computing, the data is processed locally, and safety or equipment alerts can be acted upon immediately. In manufacturing and transportation, preventive maintenance applications can process a huge amount of sensor data to identify equipment failures in advance. In retail, data from parking lot video cameras can not only provide security surveillance, but can also work with fog analytics capabilities to predict store traffic flow, optimize staffing, etc.

How is OpenFog organized and governed?
A: The OpenFog Consortium is formed as a non-profit organization. It is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors, which consists of Founders, Contributing Members, and one Non-Profit Organization.  Our current OpenFog Officers and Board of Directors are listed here. Information on current Board members is located here.

How is the work done?
A: The work of OpenFog is done by members organized in four committees, under the direction of the Board of Directors. These committees are Technical, Marketing, Affiliations and Regional.  There are several workgroups organized under the Committees, each focused on specific areas related to fog computing.

What work has been done since OpenFog was launched in November 2015?
A: We’ve been busy.  First, we launched and established our governance structure, and established and launched Committees and workgroups, with charters and objectives.  One of the first tasks was to create a common definition of fog computing – there’s a lot of confusion out there, and this was critical.  We laid out our vision for an open fog computing architecture, publishing the Overview of OpenFog Architecture white paper in March 2016.  We formed technical workgroups in Architecture Framework; Communication; Security; Testbeds; Manageability; Software Infrastructure; and Liaisons; they have been hard at work on the OpenFog reference architecture framework, to be released in the 4Q 2016. (Targeted date:  October).  We formed affiliations with IEEE, ITAC and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, and formed a technical liaison the OPC Foundation.  Finally, we have continually evolved and strengthened the governance of OpenFog through an expanded Board of Directors.

How do the members do the work?
A: OpenFog Consortium holds general membership meetings three times a year, held in rotating locations, where a large focus of the meeting is devoted to workgroup breakout sessions.  In addition, the committees and workgroups meet on a weekly or bi-weekly basis via WebEx.

What about the Regional Committees? How do they work?
A: OpenFog currently has two active Regional Committees:  Japan and North America.  There will be Regional Committees established in Europe and the Greater China Region in the near future. These Committees conduct their activities in the local languages and are headed by an elected Regional Director.  Each Committee has specific focused initiatives that complement the overall mission of OpenFog.

Is an OpenFog architecture more complex and costly than the traditional cloud-centric models?
A: While adding fog computing to an IoT network would seem to add complexity, that complexity is sometimes necessary. In certain use cases, fog computing solves the inadequacies of cloud-only models, which have serious latency, network bandwidth, geographic focus, plus reliability and security challenges.  OpenFog is taking steps to manage the incremental capacity increase in networks by creating common hardware and software platforms and very sophisticated orchestration, management, configuration, and network analytics capabilities to largely automate the operation of fog networks.  We believe that the addition of fog to IoT networks will greatly increase their capabilities and revenue potential, leading to a very short payback for the purchase and installation of a fog network.

I already belong to other organizations. Why should my organization get involved with OpenFog?
A: Despite all its hype, the IoT revolution is only just beginning. Applications and processes won’t begin to reach their full potential until we solve critical data issues associated with latency and bandwidth. This requires creating a highly-scalable and collaborative approach through fog computing, by organizations with deep expertise in a wide range of industries and technologies. Companies that wants to help drive this, can and should join the Consortium. Besides influencing the technical architecture framework, members develop important collaborative relationships with organizations at the forefront of fog computing. In addition, members can participate in OpenFog testbeds, networking events and other activities.

How can my firm get involved? Can individuals get involved?
A: Membership is open to any organization or individual who wishes to join, regardless of size or geographic location. There are five levels of memberships available: Contributing member ($100,000/year); Influencing member ($25,000/year); Small Company member ($10,000/year); Government or Special Interest Group member ($5,000); and Academic/Nonprofit/Individual member ($5,000/year).

I have additional questions.  Who do I contact?
A: Please contact us at +1 510-492-4027 or via email at info@OpenFogConsortium.org.

Historical Examples



                            There is a consortium as regards loans, which will have the power of the purse and will therefore be the real Government of China.                        


The Problem of China


                            Bertrand Russell                        




                            The consortium was not to interfere in the domestic affairs of China.                        


The Pacific Triangle


                            Sydney Greenbie                        




                            China evidently was placated by Lamont with full explanations of what the consortium intended.

                            Sydney Greenbie                        




                            As the Americans are the only people who have much spare capital, they will control the consortium.                        


The Problem of China
