EV Roadmap 10: Test Drive the Future
"The future is already here - it's just not evenly distributed." 
- William Gibson, science fiction author.
William Gibson's words are particularly apt in describing the electric and "smart" mobility space. In some communities - ranging from California to Norway - electric vehicles represent 20-30% of new car sales. In other communities, such vehicles are virtually unheard of. Likewise, some communities are already testing multiple forms of connected, autonomous, and shared mobility - while many other parts of the world consider such technologies a form of science fiction.
The mobility industry is changing fast, and the rate of that change continues to accelerate. For example, through Electrify America, the Volkswagen Group of America will invest $2 billion over the next 10 years in Zero Emission vehicle infrastructure, awareness and other measures that will transform the electric vehicle market in the U.S.
EV Roadmap 10 invites participants to "test drive the future," learning from industry leaders as well as the leading communities and regional markets.  EV Roadmap 10 programming will be organized around three tracks:



Cars. This track will focus on the accelerating adoption of electric cars and other electric vehicles. Sessions will explore the emergence of electric vehicles in new market segments, such as transit and freight vehicles; the natural synergies between electric, connected, shared, and autonomous mobility; and aggressive new public-private marketing strategies. 
Charging. Charging infrastructure is evolving quickly to meet the needs of millions of new electric vehicle drivers. This track will explore how to make charging easier, faster, and more commonplace. 
Community. The community track will focus on the broader "ecosystem" needed for the market to expand. Sessions will include an in-depth discussion of the Electrify America plan, programs designed to bring electric mobility benefits to underserved communities, and analysis of how electric vehicle adoption can lower electricity rates.

Building Charging Into Right of Way ▾
  
Over the years, local governments have upgraded their streets to accommodate horses, cars, and bicycles; however, they have been slow to support charging systems in the public right of way. Charging infrastructure in highly visible on-street locations can help promote electric vehicle adoption and provide charging opportunities for car sharing, ride hailing services, drivers without private garages. Furthermore, integrating charging into other urban infrastructure like street lighting can lower costs, and may even help accelerate upgrades in those systems. This session will explore various projects and strategies that seek to integrate charging into the urban streetscape.

This session will analyze which local, state, and federal policies are most promising in promoting transportation electrification; how these policies can best be secured; and what challenges and opportunities lie ahead.
