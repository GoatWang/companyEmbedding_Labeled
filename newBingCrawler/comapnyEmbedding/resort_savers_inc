(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Overview  Resort Savers was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012. At formation, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share,. Our fiscal year end is January 31. Resort Savers has limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale of our securities for funding. Resort Savers has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any kind of legal proceeding.  On August 1, 2014, a change of control of the Company occurred, whereby a controlling interest in the Company was sold by Michelle LaCour, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and director and a former 5% stockholder, and James LaCour, our former Secretary and director and a former 5% stockholder, to the following: (1) Zhou Gui Bin (236,733 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share); (2) Zhou Wei (236,733 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share); and (3) Zong Xin (1,636,734 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share).  On September 25, 2014 the Company effected a forward stock split of 10 shares of common stock for each share held, or an additional nine shares were issued for each common share held. All share and per share information has been retroactively restated for financial presentation of prior periods.  Worx America, Inc.  Worx designs automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduces tank cleaning time, reduces or eliminates the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results vary from tank to tank and may involve variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Worx is currently refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency. Our investment in Worx has facilitated this development. We hope that our investment into what we believe is an important technology will give us early access to the technology, establish relationships in the industry, and allow us to assist Worx with the launch of its commercial products in China and other parts of Asia.  Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.  On October 1, 2015, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui, by and through a newly formed PRC corporation subsidiary Huaxin, completed a purchase of sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Amuli, for 3,033,926 shares of the Company's common stock. The purchase price was valued $2,400,000.  Amuli is in development to become a large producer of the health beverage drink Kvass. Amuli has purchased equipment and is currently expanding its production facilities that are forecasted to generate sales and profits in 2016.  On October 9, 2015, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock that the Company shall be authorized to have outstanding at any time to 1,000,000,000 shares.  Table of Contents  Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.  On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Mr. Yang Baojin, a citizen of the PRC, and Huaxin, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xing Rui, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Baojin is the president and majority owner of BYTOC.  The Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will issue 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Baojin, and Mr. Baojin will deliver to Huaxin an ownership interest in BYTOC such that Huaxin will own 51% of all ownership interests in BYTOC, provided that 1,200,000 shares of the Company's common stock (20% of the common stock to be delivered to Mr. Baojin) will be withheld by the Company for a period of 12 months in order to secure against breach by Mr. Baojin of his representations and warranties contained in the Agreement, as well as to secure the fulfillment of his covenants and further obligations under the Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange").  BYTOC is principally engaged in the trading of oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC. Apart from the transactions pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, neither the Company nor Huaxin has a material relationship with either of Mr. Baojin or BYTOC.  Under the Exchange Agreement, Mr. Baojin guarantees, for five years, that BYTOC will have an annual net income of Renminbi (the currency of the PRC - "RMB") 10 million. To the extent that in any year the actual net income of BYTOC is less than RMB 10 million, then Mr. Baojin will pay Huaxin a cash payment equal to 51% of the shortfall.  The Exchange Agreement was approved by a written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company on January 29, 2016 and the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement occurred concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement.  As a result of the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement, Huaxin now owns a majority of the ownership interest of BYTOC. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable following the closing, the parties will amend the articles of association and bylaws of BYTOC so as to require a vote of the majority of the ownership interests in BYTOC to (i) approve the acquisition of BYTOC by means of a merger, (ii) approve the sale of substantially all assets of BYTOC, (iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of BYTOC, (iv) amend, alter or repeal any provision of the articles of association or bylaws of BYTOC, (v) create any class or series of capital stock of BYTOC, (vi) pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on any shares of capital stock of BYTOC, (vii) issue any debt security, and/or (viii) elect each member of the board of directors of BYTOC.  The total value of the exchange, based on the value of the Company's common stock as of the close of trading on January 28, 2016, was $3,435,000.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report.

Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Stockholders' equity was $6,300,255 as of January 31, 2017, as compared to $8,543,629 as of January 31, 2016.  The following summary of our results of operations, for the years ended January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016, should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, as included in this annual report on Form 10-K.   Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 REVENUE $ 94,804,190 $ - COST OF GOODS SOLD 94,247,019 - GROSS PROFIT 557,171 - OPERATING EXPENSES General and administrative 664,343 36,030 Professional fees 85,771 146,667 Total Operating Expenses 750,114 182,697 LOSS FROM OPERATIONS (192,943 ) (182,697 ) OTHER INCOME Other income 77,528 - OTHER EXPENSE Other expense (3,958 ) - Impairment loss of investment (1,907,308 ) - Goodwill impairment - (4,005,224 ) Interest expense (100,300 ) - Equity loss on unconsolidated affiliate investment - (92,692 ) Total Other Expenses (2,011,566 ) (4,097,916 ) LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (2,126,981 ) (4,280,613 ) Provision for income taxes (5,454 ) - NET LOSS $ (2,132,435 ) $ (4,280,613 )  Revenues  We generated revenues of $94,804,190 and $0 during the years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue was due to the acquisition of Tieshan Oil on January 29, 2016. All revenue of Tieshan Oil before the date of acquisition was excluded in the financial statements.  Table of Contents  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the year ended January 31, 2017, increased to $750,114 by $567,417 from $182,697 for the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase in expenses can be attributed to increased general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increase in the scale of operation of the Company.  Other income  During the year ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized other income of $77,528 and $0, respectively.  Other Expenses  Other expenses for the year ended January 31, 2017 were $2,011,566 as compared to $4,097,916 for the year ended January 31, 2016. The other expenses for the year ended January 31, 2017 can be attributed to $1,907,308 in impairment loss on investment, $100,300 in interest expense and $3,958 in other expenses. The other expenses for the year ended January 31, 2016 can be attributed to $4,005,224 in goodwill impairment and $92,692 in equity loss on unconsolidated affiliate investment.  Net Loss  Net losses for the year ended January 31, 2017, decreased to $2,132,435 by $2,148,178 from $4,280,613 for the year ended January 31, 2016. The decrease in net losses can be attributed to the presence of gross profit of $557,171 and absence of goodwill impairment of $4,005,224, partially off set by the impairment loss of investment of $1,907,308.  Liquidity and Financial Condition Working Capital January 31, January 31, 2017 2016 Increase Current Assets $ 69,886,272 $ 26,957,038 $ 42,929,234 Current Liabilities 65,667,635 22,519,828 43,147,807 Working Capital $ 4,218,637 $ 4,437,210 $ (218,573 )  Cash Flows Year Ended Year Ended January 31, January 31, 2017 2016 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $ 1,915,897 $ (238,692 ) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities - (1,084,421 ) Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities (1,899,998 ) 241,894 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rate (189,944 ) 7,857 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash During the Year $ (174,045 ) $ (1,073,362 )  Cash Flow from Operating Activities  During the year ended January 31, 2017, our company generated $1,915,897 in cash from operating activities compared to the use of $238,692 of cash for operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributed to an increase in amount due to related parties of $63,270,068, partially offset by increase in amount due from related party of $13,287,456, increase in accounts receivable of $31,467,241, decrease in accounts payable of $4,641,908 and decrease in deposits received of $13,496,941.  Cash Flow from Investing Activities  During the year ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, we used $0 and $1,084,421, respectively, consisting of $1,300,000 in investment in Worx and $215,579 in cash received through business acquisition.  Table of Contents  Cash Flow from Financing Activities  During the year ended January 31, 2017, our company used $1,899,998 in cash in financing activities, consisting of $96,899 in loans from related parties, $1,046,160 in proceeds from short-term loan, $2,993,364 in payment of short-term loan and $49,693 in repayments of loans from related parties, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $241,894 for the year ended January 31, 2016, consisting of $241,894 loan from related parties.  Plan of Operation  Since the inception of the Company, we have incurred significant losses and relied upon capital raised from affiliates and third parties. The Company makes investments and acquisitions into sound, transparent markets and industries throughout the world. In China, the Company has invested in companies with innovative and market-ready petroleum industry technologies for potential installation and distribution throughout the Greater China market.  Amuli has purchased equipment and is currently expanding its production facilities that are forecasted to generate sales and profits in 2017. In light of our recent investment in Worx and acquisitions of BYTOC and Amuli, we anticipate generating revenues from the operations of such entities during the next 12 months. Notwithstanding, in light of our ongoing expenses, our management cannot provide any assurances that such revenue will be sufficient to cover all of our expenses or that our Company will ever operate profitably.  During the next year of operations, our officers and directors will also provide their labor at no charge. We have hired 10 staff and do not anticipate hiring any more staff in the next 12 months of operation.  We are a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. We estimate that these accounting, legal and other professional costs would be a minimum of $250,000 in the next year and will be higher, in the following years, if our business volume and activity increases. Increased business activity could greatly increase our professional fees for reporting requirements and this could have a significant impact on future operating costs. The difference between having the ability to sustain our cash flow requirements over the next twelve months and the need for additional outside funding will depend on how fast we can generate sales revenue.  Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.  If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our financial statements from June 25, 2012 (date of inception) through the period ended January 31, 2017, reported revenues of $94,804,190 and accumulated deficit of $4,816,615.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward-Looking Statements  Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.  All references in this Form 10-Q to the "Company," "Resort Savers," "we," "us," or "our" are to Resort Savers, Inc.  Corporate Overview  Resort Savers, Inc. (the "Company" or "Resort Savers" or "RSSV") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012. The Company was authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Our fiscal year end is January 31. Resort Savers has limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale of our securities for funding. Resort Savers has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any kind of legal proceeding.  During the year ended January 31, 2016, the Company issued the following shares:  � 20,955 common shares to an unaffiliated investor for cash subscription paid before January 31, 2015  � 5,000,000 common shares to an unaffiliated investor in exchange of 1,000,000 common shares of BRI  � 3,033,926 common shares to a shareholder in Amuli, for the shareholder's 60% interest in Amuli.  � 4,800,000 common shares to Mr. Yang Boajin, a shareholder in Tieshan Oil, for his 51% interest in Tieshan Oil.  Worx America, Inc.  From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd., a Seychelles corporation ("Xing Rui"), acquired 20,068,750 common shares of Worx America, Inc. ("Worx"), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 20,068,750 common shares of Worx, representing 20% of Worx's the then issued and outstanding voting common stock on a fully converted and diluted basis. More specifically,  Table of Contents  Prior to June 6, 2016, Worx designed automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduced tank cleaning time, reduced or eliminated the need for personnel to enter tanks, and attempted to reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results varied from tank to tank and involved variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Prior to June 6, 2016, Worx was refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency. Our investment in Worx had facilitated such development. We had hoped that our investment into what we believed was an important technology would give us early access to the technology, establish relationships in the industry, and allow us to assist Worx with the launch of its commercial products in China and other parts of Asia. However, on June 6, 2016, Worx sold all of its assets ("Asset Sale"), including, but not limited to, its technologies and intellectual property, to Bay WorxRail, LLC ("Bay WorxRail") for $1,000,000 ("Purchase Price"), subject to a holdback of $250,000 of the Purchase Price, pursuant to the terms set forth in that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated June 6, 2016, among Worx, Bay WorxRail, and Michael Zilai, as majority stockholder of Worx. The Asset Sale by Worx resulted in the full impairment of our investment in Worx at the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2016.  Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.  On October 1, 2015, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui, by and through a newly formed People's Republic of China (the "PRC") corporation subsidiary HuaxinChangrong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Company Limited ("Huaxin"), completed a purchase from Xu Xiao Yun of sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd., a PRC corporation ("Amuli"), for 3,033,926 shares of the Company's common stock. The purchase price was valued $2,400,000.  Apart from the transactions described above, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has a material relationship with either Mr. Xu Xiao Yun or Amuli.  Amuli is in development to become a large producer of the health beverage drink Kvass. Amuli has purchased equipment and is currently expanding its production facilities that are forecasted to generate sales and profits in 2016.  On October 9, 2015, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock that the Company shall be authorized to have outstanding at any time to 1,000,000,000 shares.  Beijing YandongTieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.  On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Mr. Yang Baojin, a citizen of the PRC, and Huaxin, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xing Rui, whereas Xing Rui itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Baojin is the president and majority owner of Beijing YandongTieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC ("BYTOC").  The Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will issue 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Baojin, and Mr. Baojin will deliver to Huaxin an ownership interest in BYTOC such that Huaxin will own 51% of all ownership interests in BYTOC, provided that 1,200,000 shares of the Company's common stock (20% of the common stock to be delivered to Mr. Baojin) will be withheld by the Company for a period of 12 months in order to secure against breach by Mr. Baojin of his representations and warranties contained in the Agreement, as well as to secure the fulfillment of his covenants and further obligations under the Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange"). Therefore, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, on January 29, 2016, the Company issued 4,800,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Baojin.  Table of Contents  BYTOC is principally engaged in the trading of oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC. Apart from the transactions pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has a material relationship with either Mr. Baojin or BYTOC.  Under the Exchange Agreement, Mr. Baojin guarantees, for five years, that BYTOC will have an annual net income of Renminbi (the currency of the PRC - "RMB") 10 million. To the extent that in any year the actual net income of BYTOC is less than RMB 10 million, then Mr. Baojin will pay Huaxin a cash payment equal to 51% of the shortfall.  The Exchange Agreement was approved by a written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company on January 29, 2016 and the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement occurred concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement.  As a result of the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement, Huaxin now owns a majority of the ownership interest of BYTOC. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable following the closing, the parties will amend the articles of association and bylaws of BYTOC so as to require a vote of the majority of the ownership interests in BYTOC to (i) approve the acquisition of BYTOC by means of a merger, (ii) approve the sale of substantially all assets of BYTOC, (iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of BYTOC, (iv) amend, alter or repeal any provision of the articles of association or bylaws of BYTOC, (v) create any class or series of capital stock of BYTOC, (vi) pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on any shares of capital stock of BYTOC, (vii) issue any debt security, and/or (viii) elect each member of the board of directors of BYTOC.  The total value of the exchange, based on the value of the Company's common stock as of the close of trading on January 28, 2016, was $3,435,000.  Kashi Jinju Colour Printing Packaging Co. LTD.  On May 12, 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui signed a definitive Letter of Intent with the stockholders of Kashi Jinju Colour Printing Packaging Co. LTD., a PRC corporation ("Kashi Jinju") which manufactures cardboard boxes. The stockholders of Kashi Jinju and the Company intend to enter into a share exchange, wherein the stockholders of Kashi Jinju will exchange 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Kashi Jinju for 32,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. As of October 31, 2016, the Company and Kashi Jinju are still working towards satisfying conditions of the Letter of Intent, including regulatory approvals and licensing in the PRC, which are required to close the transaction.  Our Board of Directors will be primarily responsible for investigating combination opportunities. However, we believe that business opportunities may also come to our attention from various sources, including professional advisors such as attorneys, accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. We have no plan, understanding, agreements or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for us.  We do not propose to restrict our search for business opportunity to any particular geographical area or industry, and, therefore, we are unable to predict the nature of our future business operations. Our management's discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the period ended October 31, 2016, together with notes thereto, which are included in this report.

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  There is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance since we were formed in June 2012. We have only began to generate revenues since the beginning of this fiscal year 2016. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.  If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.

Resort Savers, Inc. (RSSV) Clarifies Acquisition of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Company, Ltd.




/EINPresswire.com/ -- SHENZHEN, CHINA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/27/15 --  Resort Savers, Inc. (OTCQB: RSSV), a strategic investment and development company, today clarified its September 16, 2015 press release announcing its acquisition of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd. (Amuli), a large producer of Kvass health and wellness drinks. Certain details of the original press release were issued in error, and should not be relied upon an as indication of future performance by the Company.


The original press release issued stated that Resort Savers, Inc. purchased a majority interest in Amuli, which was an error. Due to restrictions on foreign ownership of operating Chinese companies, Resort Savers, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was prohibited from purchasing a majority interest in Amuli.



Rather, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group, Ltd., through its newly formed a Peoples Republic of China corporation subsidiary, Hua Xin Chang Rong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Company Limited ("Hua Xin Chang"), purchased the sixty percent majority interest in Amuli. The transaction closed upon the issuance of the shares of the Company's common stock and the transfer of the shares of Amuli to Hua Xin Chang in October.


Moreover, the previous press release stated that Amuli was generating profit which was also in error. Amuli has yet to realize any sales or profit. Sales are expected to begin in 2016.

	(for policies with no terrorism exclusion or sublimit)





	You are hereby notified that, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (the Act), effective December 26, 2007, this policy makes available to you insurance for losses arising out of certain
	acts of terrorism. Terrorism is defined as any act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is
	dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have been committed by
	an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.




	You should know that the insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by acts of terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under the
	formula set forth in the Act. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses that exceed the statutorily established deductible to be paid by the insurance company providing the coverage.




	However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through
	December 31), the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.

	If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a
	Program Year (January 1 through December 31) and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act, we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up
	to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.




	The portion of
	your policys annual premium that is attributable to insurance for such acts of terrorism is:

	If you have

	IMPORTANT NOTICE TO POLICYHOLDERS





	All of the members of the Chubb Group of Insurance companies doing business in the United States (hereinafter Chubb)
	distribute their products through licensed insurance brokers and agents (producers). Detailed information regarding the types of compensation paid by Chubb to producers on US insurance transactions is available under the Producer
	Compensation link located at the bottom of the page at www.chubb.com, or by calling 1-866-588-9478. Additional information may be available from your producer.

	NOTICE CONCERNING POLICYHOLDER RIGHTS IN AN






	INSOLVENCY UNDER THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE






	GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAW





	The financial strength of your insurer is one of the most
	important things for you to consider when determining from whom to purchase a property or liability insurance policy. It is your best assurance that you will receive the protection for which you purchased the policy. If your insurer becomes
	insolvent, you may have protection from the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association as described below but to the extent that your policy is not protected by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association or if it exceeds the guaranty
	associations limits, you will only have the assets, if any, of the insolvent insurer to satisfy your claim.




	Residents of Minnesota who
	purchase property and casualty or liability insurance companies licensed to do business in Minnesota are protected;

	SUBJECT TO LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS,

	in the event the insurer becomes insolvent. This protection is provided by the Minnesota
	Insurance Guaranty Association.





	Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association






	4640 West 77th Street, Suite 342






	Edina, Minnesota 55435






	(612) 831-1908





	The maximum amount that the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association will pay in regard to a claim under all policies issued by the same insurer is
	limited to $300,000. This limit does not apply to workers compensation insurance. Protection by the Guaranty Association is subject to other substantial limitations and exclusions. If your claim exceeds the Guaranty Associations limits
	you may still recover a part or all of that amount from the proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvent insurer, if any exist. Funds to pay claims may not be immediately available. The Guaranty Association assesses insurers licensed to sell
	property and casualty or liability insurance in Minnesota after the insolvency occurs. Claims are paid from the assessment.





	THE PROTECTION
	PROVIDED BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR USING CARE IN SELECTING INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE WELL MANAGED AND FINANCIALLY STABLE. IN SELECTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY OR POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON PROTECTION BY THE GUARANTY
	ASSOCIATION.





	THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY MINNESOTA STATE LAW TO ADVISE POLICYHOLDERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES OF THEIR
	RIGHTS IN THE EVENT THEIR INSURANCE CARRIER BECOMES INSOLVENT. THIS NOTICE IN NO WAY IMPLIES THAT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. ALL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE.

	Important Notice:







	The SEC Requires Proof of Your Fidelity Insurance Policy





	Your company is now required to
	file an electronic copy of your fidelity insurance coverage (Chubbs ICAP Bond policy) to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to rules adopted by the SEC on June 12, 2006.




	Chubb is in the process of providing your agent/broker with an electronic copy of your insurance policy as well as instructions on how to submit this
	proof of fidelity insurance coverage to the SEC. You can expect to receive this information from your agent/broker shortly.




	The electronic
	copy of your policy is provided by Chubb solely as a convenience and does not affect the terms and conditions of coverage as set forth in the paper policy you receive by mail. The terms and conditions of the policy mailed to you, which are the same
	as those set forth in the electronic copy, constitute the entire agreement between your company and Chubb.




	If you have any questions, please
	contact your agent or broker.

Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses. Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes” and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the sections “Business,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” You should carefully review the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.
All references in this Form 10-Q to the “Company,” “Resort Savers,” “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Resort Savers, Inc.
Corporate Overview

Resort Savers, Inc. (the “Company” or “Resort Savers” or “RSSV”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012. The Company was authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Our fiscal year end is January 31. Resort Savers has limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale of our securities for funding. Resort Savers has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

During the year ended January 31, 2016, the Company issued the following shares:


20,955 common shares to an unaffiliated investor for cash subscription paid before January 31, 2015
5,000,000 common shares to an unaffiliated investor in exchange of 1,000,000 common shares of BRI
3,033,926 common shares to a shareholder in Amuli, for the shareholder’s 60% interest in Amuli.
4,800,000 common shares to Mr. Yang Boajin, a shareholder in Tieshan Oil, for his 51% interest in Tieshan Oil.

Worx America, Inc.

From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd., a Seychelles corporation (“Xing Rui”), acquired 20,068,750 common shares of Worx America, Inc. (“Worx”), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 20,068,750 common shares of Worx, representing 20% of Worx’s the then issued and outstanding voting common stock on a fully converted and diluted basis. More specifically,
(i) on January 28, 2015, $350,000 cash was paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 5,403,728 common shares of Worx and (ii) on March 20, 2015, $1,300,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 14,665,022 common shares of Worx. This investment was accounted for under equity method with initial cost of $2,000,000.



Worx designs automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduces tank cleaning time, reduces or eliminates the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results vary from tank to tank and may involve variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Worx is currently refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency. Our investment in Worx has facilitated this development. We hope that our investment into what we believe is an important technology will give us early access to the technology, establish relationships in the industry, and allow us to assist Worx with the launch of its commercial products in China and other parts of Asia.

Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.

On October 1, 2015, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui, by and through a newly formed People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) corporation subsidiary Huaxin Changrong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Company Limited (“Huaxin”), completed a purchase from Xu Xiao Yun of sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd., a PRC corporation (“Amuli”), for 3,033,926 shares of the Company’s common stock. The purchase price was valued $2,400,000.

Apart from the transactions described above, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has a material relationship with either Mr. Xu Xiao Yun or Amuli.

Amuli is in development to become a large producer of the health beverage drink Kvass. Amuli has purchased equipment and is currently expanding its production facilities that are forecasted to generate sales and profits in 2016.

On October 9, 2015, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock that the Company shall be authorized to have outstanding at any time to 1,000,000,000 shares.

Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.

On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang Baojin, a citizen of the PRC, and Huaxin, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xing Rui, whereas Xing Rui itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Baojin is the president and majority owner of Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC (“BYTOC”).

The Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will issue 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Baojin, and Mr. Baojin will deliver to Huaxin an ownership interest in BYTOC such that Huaxin will own 51% of all ownership interests in BYTOC, provided that 1,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (20% of the common stock to be delivered to Mr. Baojin) will be withheld by the Company for a period of 12 months in order to secure against breach by Mr. Baojin of his representations and warranties contained in the Agreement, as well as to secure the fulfillment of his covenants and further obligations under the Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”). Therefore, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, on January 29, 2016, the Company issued 4,800,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Baojin.

BYTOC is principally engaged in the trading of oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC. Apart from the transactions pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has a material relationship with either Mr. Baojin or BYTOC.


Under the Exchange Agreement, Mr. Baojin guarantees, for five years, that BYTOC will have an annual net income of Renminbi (the currency of the PRC – “RMB”) 10 million. To the extent that in any year the actual net income of BYTOC is less than RMB 10 million, then Mr. Baojin will pay Huaxin a cash payment equal to 51% of the shortfall.

The Exchange Agreement was approved by a written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company on January 29, 2016 and the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement occurred concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement.

As a result of the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement, Huaxin now owns a majority of the ownership interest of BYTOC. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable following the closing, the parties will amend the articles of association and bylaws of BYTOC so as to require a vote of the majority of the ownership interests in BYTOC to (i) approve the acquisition of BYTOC by means of a merger, (ii) approve the sale of substantially all assets of BYTOC, (iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of BYTOC, (iv) amend, alter or repeal any provision of the articles of association or bylaws of BYTOC, (v) create any class or series of capital stock of BYTOC, (vi) pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on any shares of capital stock of BYTOC, (vii) issue any debt security, and/or (viii) elect each member of the board of directors of BYTOC.

The total value of the exchange, based on the value of the Company’s common stock as of the close of trading on January 28, 2016, was $3,435,000.

Kashi Jinju Colour Printing Packaging Co. LTD.

On May 12, 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui signed a definitive Letter of Intent with the stockholders of Kashi Jinju Colour Printing Packaging Co. LTD., a PRC corporation (“Kashi Jinju”) which manufactures cardboard boxes. The stockholders of Kashi Jinju and the Company intend to enter into a share exchange, wherein the stockholders of Kashi Jinju will exchange 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Kashi Jinju for 32,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.

Our Board of Directors will be primarily responsible for investigating combination opportunities. However, we believe that business opportunities may also come to our attention from various sources, including professional advisors such as attorneys, accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. We have no plan, understanding, agreements or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for us. We do not propose to restrict our search for business opportunity to any particular geographical area or industry, and, therefore, we are unable to predict the nature of our future business operations. Our management’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.

Resort Savers, Inc. Announces $2 Million Investment to Acquire Worx America, Inc. Interest

The Letter-of-Intent Equity Investment Will Secure 20% Interest in World-Wide Operations and All China Marketing, Sales and Installation Rights
SHENZHEN, CHINA–(Marketwired – Feb 3, 2015) – Resort Savers, Inc. (OTCQB: RSSV), an energy services and technology licensing, marketing and distribution firm in China, is proud to announce a $2 Million USD Letter-of-Intent signed for the equity investment in Worx America, Inc. RSSV will own 20% of Worx world-wide operations and exclusive China marketing and installation rights for Worx’s proprietary technologies, engineering and petroleum industry robotics. Both companies are actively working together in China with customer sales and installations in anticipation of the signing, closing and funding of this equity transaction.
Worx America is a Houston, Texas based innovative environmental energy engineering company known for their expert diagnostic abilities and a diversified line of patent products. It is in the business of designing, developing and implementing proprietary automated technologies for oil tank, reservoir, lagoon and on location field cleaning systems and drilling, off-shore and subsea production technology services.
Mike Zilai, President of Worx America, said, “Our Worx patented systems are mobile, energy independent, flexible and adaptable to local conditions for all major industries, including the petroleum industry and metallurgical industries. Our company is known for our ability to bring solutions and implement recommendations in a timely, cost effective and customer-profitable manner that is unmatched in the industries we serve.”
Global Opportunity
Zilai continued, “Worx is globally focused and not market constrained, targeting the world’s major petroleum operations markets for their innovative oil storage cleaning systems, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Nigeria, Oman, Russia, South Korea and China. The company has top management, owns a growing line of proprietary market-specific systems and is well-positioned as a high margin, competitive company.”
China is the world’s largest net importer of crude oil and is steadily increasing and expanding oil and refining capacity to meet the strong demand for all crude oil types. In the next five years China’s energy supply systems will continue to be under safety and environmental pressures. So refining capacity through cleaning and maintenance and increased availability of petroleum products are the main thrust of China’s petroleum policies and goal to becoming the refining powerhouse for Asia. At the end of 2013, China’s refining capacity was at 12.8 million barrels a day, which was nearly a million barrel increase over 2012.
Booming China Market
Zhou Gui Bin, President of RSSV, said, “RSSV’s goal is to rapidly gain market share in China’s under-served oil tank cleaning and sludge processing industries through Worx technologies and on-ground training and installation. Senior management of Worx has been working in the field at RSSV’s China operations and has developed a training program for our top engineers to go to Houston for further training and on-site systems installation and operations.”
Zhou Gui Bin went on to say, “China’s petroleum industry has aging systems in operation that are not operating at full capacity. With the Worx technologies we will be able to keep operations going, meet local and national environmental goals and regulations, lower labor costs and lower pay off time for bringing equipment back on line and up to full operating capacity.
Ground-Breaking Technology
“Worx’s automated robotic systems quickly clean and recover usable oil from oil container waste sludge, resulting in increased sales and decreased tank cleaning time. These technologies reduce tank cleaning time by over 70% and can recover 50% clean oil from waste sludge. This technology not only saves our client’s money, but makes them money.”
RSSV’s marketing is focused on China’s largest crude oil refinery operations. These include Zhenhai, Dalian, Shanghai, Maoming, Guangzhou, Jilin, Tianjin, Fujian, Huizhou, Lanzhou, Dushanzi, Yanshan, Qilu, Qingdau, Guangxi, Dallan and Yangxzi. These major markets are all working with aging facilities that need to be kept on line while the government and industry work to replace them with new low-carbon processing capabilities.
Mike Zilai, President of Worx America, said, “The problem for China and the opportunity for RSSV is that China’s refining capacity was below 75% in 2013, down from 82% in 2010. Every time a refining project is delayed, canceled or put on hold is lost profits for that company. This is happening to CNPC and Sinopec state-owned projects in Kunming, Jieyang and Huabei which in turn have to increase their refining operations to off-set losses. I have been working in China and know first hand that this has opened up enormous RSSV sales and marketing opportunities to sell our Worx technologies into.”
Reducing Costs, Improving Profits
Zilai went on to say, “Environmental concerns have prompted the Chinese government to adopt stricter petroleum product standards and specifications to lower sulfur emissions. They are achieving this through requiring refineries to implement Euro equivalent standards, which requires significant upgrades and infrastructure investments to meet these emission standards. The country’s majority of refineries are small, independents, which are facing costly challenges to meet the standards to avoid Ministry of Environment restrictions and bans. Through Worx technologies, these companies will be able to not only increase capacity but recapture lost profits.”
The drop in oil prices only increases the Worx-RSSV market opportunities. Zilal said, “The need for petroleum companies to keep full production capacity going and recapture lost profits only increases as oil prices drop. It lifts demand and need for Worx Systems and Technologies and in turn should enormously lift RSSV profits in China.”
Zhou Gui Bin, President of RSSV, said, “RSSV is committed to forming strategic partnerships and licensing key technologies for their extensive building customer base. They are rapidly developing the technical support training, and systems documentation and implementation cost-savings programs designed by Worx that keep their customers operating at full capacity.”
Mike Zilai, President of Worx America, said, “Worx is extremely excited to be partnered with RSSV and are ready to enter the China market full force. I have been working with RSSV on ground in China since 2013. China is the world’s largest oil market. There is a great opportunity and need for Worx products. RSSV will not only have the exclusive rights to the Greater China market, but will be our equity partners as we expand our operations world-wide.”
Zilai concluded, “Worx is currently negotiating major contracts with leading oil and gas companies across the world. Our partnership with RSSV now gives us direct access to China’s booming oil market and the chance to become an industry leader. With our partnership with RSSV, Worx and RSSV plan on making 2015 our best year yet.”
