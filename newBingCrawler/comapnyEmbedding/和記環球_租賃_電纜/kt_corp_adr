In June 2008, with its PUreCSR corporate responsibility system, Pegatron became a member of the EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition), a group of companies in the electronics industry that supports a credible implementation of the Code of Conduct throughout the electronics and information and communications technology supply chain, ensuring safe working conditions, respect and dignity to employees, and environmentally responsible manufacturing processes.[8] Pegatron's corporate responsibility system, PUreCSR (which stands for "P"egatron & "U"nihan "re"duce, "re"use, "re"cycle, "re"covery, "re"place & "re"pair Corporate Social Responsibility), meets the international standards: the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, the OHSAS 18001 occupational Health and Safety Management System, and the QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management System.[9] On May 18, 2010, the board of directors at Pegatron unanimously approved to appropriate a sum within 0.5% of net income every year to charity.[9]
PEGA Design and Engineering (PEGA D&E)[edit]
PEGA Design and Engineering is Pegatron's design team that was originally branched off from the ASUSTeK design team. The PEGA D&E helps Pegatron's clients with product development, including market research, conceptualization, product design, materials study and production.[10]
In addition to 3C (computer, communication, consumer) electronic products, Pegatron designs home appliances and home decor products such as LCD TVs, LED lightings, phones and more.[11]
PEGA CASA (Pegatron MID - ID design team)[edit]
Led by Alain Lee, PEGA CASA design team (that was originally branched off from the Asus design team) is dedicated to the design and development of non-IT products in addition to the existing IT product design, including notebooks, smartphones, e-books, network communication equipment, displays, projectors, cleaning robots and more. These non-IT products include home appliances (PEGA CASA), fashion accessories, vehicle accessories (PEGA MOTORS), building interior design and building materials, multimedia ads and marketing, and cultural businesses.
Controversies[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
In December 2014 a BBC investigation exposed poor working conditions and employee mistreatment at Pegatron factories making Apple products near Shanghai.[12] It uncovered staff forced to work eighteen days straight without a day off, workers falling asleep on the production line during 12-hour shifts (sometimes 16 hours), forced overtime and dormitory rooms where 12 workers shared a cramped room.[12][13]

SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (Hangul: SK텔레콤 or 에스케이텔레콤) (full name: Sunkyoung Telecom) is a South Korean wireless telecommunications operator, it is part of the SK Group, one of the country's largest chaebols.
SK Telecom is South Korea's largest wireless carrier, it leads the local market with 50.5 percent share as of 2008.[2] Since its creation in 1984, the company has evolved from a first generation analog cellular system, to second generation CDMA, then to the world's first third-generation synchronized IMT-2000 cellular system. SK Telecom also became the world’s first carrier to commercialize HSDPA in May 2006. SK expanded into the landline market by acquiring second-rated fixed-line operator Hanaro Telecom in February 2008.
The company’s online brands include "Nate," a web portal; "June," a mobile multimedia service; "Moneta," an e-banking mobile app; "Nate Drive," a telematics service and "Digital Home," an online interface to remote-control household appliances.[3]
Online services are offered through tech subsidiary SK Communications, which also dominates the social networks market in South Korea. "Cyworld" is the largest social media site by membership and "NateOn" is the number one instant messaging client.[4]
In 2004, SK Telecom launched "Hanbyul," the world’s first DMB satellite. TU Media, SK Telecom's digital media arm, handles DMB TV broadcasts.
In November 2015 SK Telecom announced signing a deal to acquire CJ HelloVision, the country's largest cable and Internet operator, with the view to merge it with its own cable unit, SK Broadband.[5] The acquisition, which will make SK Broadband the No. 2 paid cable broadcaster following KT,[6] is being opposed by competitors, who charge that the merger will help SK unfairly dominate the market.[7][8]

History[edit]
SK Telecom was established in March 1984 under the name Korea Mobile Telecommunications Services Corp. (KMTSC; Hangul: 한국 이동 통신 서비스), but was renamed Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp. (KMTC; Hangul: 한국 이동 통신) in May 1988. It was a subsidiary of the state monopoly phone company, Korea Telecom (now known as KT Corp.) until KT sold it off in 1993.[9] In June 1994 SK Group (Formerly Sunkyong Group) became Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corporation's largest shareholder. KMTC officially joined the SK Group in January 1997 and changed its name to SK Telecom in March of that year. In October 2000, SK Telecom became the second operator in the world after NTT DoCoMo to launch a commercial 3G service using W-CDMA technology. In January 2002, this was followed up by launching the world's first CDMA2000 1xEV-DO network, offering greatly increased data transmission speeds to preexisting 2G networks.
In May 2005, SK Telecom divested 60 percent of SK Teletech stock to cellphone maker Pantech.[10] SK remains the second largest shareholder by holding on to the rest of Teletech's stock. In 2006, the well-known "SKY" brand of mobile devices became fully owned by Pantech as it finalized its takeover of SK Teletech.
1984–1993: Early Years[edit]
Founded on March 29, 1984 as Korea Mobile Telecommunications Services Corp., the state-owned carrier introduced pagers and car phones to the Korean market. May 1984 saw the launch of the car phone service. Korea Mobile changed its name to Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp. (KMTC) in May 1988. In July, AMPS cellular network was initially launched in Seoul metropolitan area. By 1991 nationwide coverage was complete.
In April 1993, the South Korean government —through KMTC— adopted CDMA as the national cellular telephone system.[11]
1994–1996: Privatization and the CDMA standard[edit]
Through privatization, SK Group became Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp.'s largest shareholder in June 1994.
In October 1994, Korea's first CDMA system was introduced to the public for the first time.
In January 1995, KMTC reached the one million subscriber mark. Korea Mobile Telecommuncations became the third Korean firm to be listed on the NYSE exchange (ADR) in June 1996. Later that year South Korea got its first commercial CDMA (IS-95A) network. Operating in Seoul in October, it is considered one of the world's earliest commercial CDMA networks.
1997–2000: International expansion[edit]
SK Group completed its takeover of KMTC in January 1997, as it became the world's sixth carrier to attain ten million subscriptions. Around that time, it also began constructing the Northeast Asian CDMA belt encompassing China, Japan, Vietnam, and the rest of the Asian continent.
In March 1997, to reflect new changes, KMTC changed its name to SK Telecom, and in October, NetsGo, an online service, was launched.

In June 1998, SK Telink, the international call service division, started offering commercial overseas call service. In December 1998, SK Teletech launched its first handset. In April 1999, SK Telecom entered the Mongolian market by co-founding Skytel LLC with nearly 30 percent ownership stake.
TTL, a wireless plan targeting younger users, and nTOP, a cellular internet service were launched in July and October 1999, respectively.
In December 1999, SK Telecom surpassed ten million subscriber mark, the following month, it launched the world’s first commercial CDMA2000 service. By the end of the year the carrier won a contract for asynchronous IMT-2000 (WCDMA) facility.[12]
2001–2007: Cellular internet and market accrual[edit]
The new millennium ushered in an era of cross-platform online networks that saw efforts to integrate mobile services, as SK Telecom was exploring new value-creating models such as m-Commerce and satellite DMB Service. In January 2002, an acquisition of Shinsegi Telecomm Inc. was completed.[13] Also in January, the company deployed world’s first commercial synchronous IMT-2000 facility.
In March 2002, the carrier struck international roaming deals between countries using CDMA and GSM networks. An agreement was signed with Israel's Pele-Phone in April to sell proprietary software that will operate on the carrier's existing CDMA network and future 1x-CDMA network.[14] In July, a MoU was signed with China Unicom to establish a joint venture. In November two mobile applications ‘June’ and ‘Moneta’ were launched. In July 2003, S-Fone, a commercial CDMA network became operative in Vietnam. In August 2003, June became the world's first 3G service to have one million subscribers. In February 2004, SK won a contract for a joint venture with China Unicom, called UNISK.

March 2004 marked a new breakthrough with the launch of Hanbyul, the world’s first DMB satellite.
MelOn, an online music store was launched in November 2004. ‘1mm’ and ‘Loview,’ a digital photo frame service were launched in April and November 2005, respectively. By December, MelOn had four million subscribers.

SK Telecom started 2006 with record revenues of KRW 10 trillion ($9.28 billion). In May the world's first commercial HSDPA handset was released. May also saw the carrier's entry into the U.S. wireless communication market with Helio. In June, SK Telecom signed a strategic partnership with China Unicom to purchase CB worth $1 billion in its subsidiary, China Unicom Hong Kong. In the same month SK deployed its WiBro internet network. In April 2007, a project to create TD-SCDMA, China's 3G wireless broadbnad equivalent was signed with the Chinese government. Around that time, S-Fone had two million subscribers in Vietnam.
2008-present: Landline and new technologies[edit]
In November 2008 SK signed an agreement to buy a controlling stake of fixed-line phone company Hanaro Telecom for 1.09 trillion won ($1.15 billion) from a consortium led by AIG and Newbridge Capital. The new entity will be the second-largest telecom firm in terms of total assets and revenues next to KT Corp.[15]
In 2013 SK Telecom was the world's first operator to offer a commercial LTE-Advanced network. This coincided with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE-A model, which offered a step-up CPU (Snapdragon 800 vs. Snapdragon 600 used in the regular model), and also LTE-Advanced capabilities. SK Telecom supported this handset at launch.[16]
On July 6, 2013, it was reported that Apple was in talks with SK Telecom, to release the iPhone 5s model on SK's LTE Advanced network.[17]
Services[edit]
As of September 2012, SK Telecom operates 2G IS-95/CDMA 2000, 3G WCDMA/HSPA+, 4G Mobile WiMAX, and LTE networks.

From May 2005 to September 2012, SK Telecom provided S-DMB through its subsidiary TU Media (later SK Telink). S-DMB service was ceased in September 2012 after significant losses in its final years.[18]
SK Telecom also provides online multiplatform entertainment, business and financial services:

MelOn: Introduced in November 2004, MelOn is SK Telecom's music e-store, which allows users to download or stream music over the internet. Music can be played on mobile phones, digital audio players, portable media players and digital cameras. Users can create their own ringtones. In 2009, LOEN Entertainment, an SK Group record label, became the company-in-charge of running MelOn. An Indonesian version of MelOn was created in cooperation with PT Telkom Indonesia.
m-Finance: an online banking system introduced in 2001, allows users to take charge of all their financial transactions. Properly equipped mobile phones can do basic banking such as wire transfers and checking balances as well as stock trading and credit card services. Users can also withdraw cash from ATMs using their phones.
Digital Home: Digital Home allows users to control and monitor home appliances, lighting, security systems and fire alarms remotely. The service utilizes high-speed internet, telephone and cable networks to achieve functionality.
Mobile RFID (m-RFID): Phones with embedded RF readers can give users key information about a product before making a purchase. SK Telecom has tested this technology for six applications including, safety, authentication, package tracking, supply chain management, digital content usage and location-based services.

International markets[edit]
SK Telecom is currently putting its efforts in expanding into global markets, such as Vietnam, U.S., and China. The company is also forging strategic alliances with other global carriers and IT businesses.
China[edit]
In 2000, SK Telecom first entered China, later forming a joint venture with China Unicom for wireless Internet service in February 2004. This joint venture between a foreign and local company, UNISK, is the first of its kind in China.
In 2006, SK Telecom bought $1 billion worth of convertible bonds of China Unicom Hong Kong, a division of China Unicom and agreed to cooperate in joint sourcing of handsets, development of additional services, platform development, marketing and distribution, customer relationship management, and network development.

These models would be refined and updated for use by tech-savvy American consumers, allowing for the first time handsets with functionalities previously unavailable in the U.S. market.
The now-defunct venture operated on the premise of being a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), using CDMA 1xEVDO network capacity leased from Sprint Nextel. In 2007, SK Telecom began talks to purchase a stake in Sprint Nextel,[19] however by 2008 it had backed away from the deal.[20]

Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call
October 30, 2015 03:00 AM ET
Executives
Young-woo Kim - IRO
Gwang-Seok Shin - CFO
Young-woo Kim
Good afternoon, I am Youngwoo Kim, KT's IRO. We will now begin Q3 2015 earnings presentation. Our call is being webcasted via the Company's Web site, so please refer to the presentation slides as we present this quarter's business results.
Please note that since the first quarter of 2011, KT has been presenting consolidated numbers under the IFRS accounting standards. From this quarter, in line with the revised disclosure guidelines of MSIP on subscriber numbers, while the subscriber calculation was based on number of total line basis, which is inclusive of KT and MVNO subscribers and other lines, which are surveillance equipment, ex the lines for the hybrid product.
Also ARPU calculation now excludes other lines that were unbilled and subscribers for the hybrid product such change was retroactively applied to Q1 2014 data.
Now I will invite our CFO, Gwang-Seok Shin for his opening remarks and presentations on Q3 2015 earnings results.
Gwang-Seok Shin
Good afternoon, I am Gwang-Seok Shin, KT's CFO. KT was able to maintain steady bottom-line driven by enhanced competitiveness of our core businesses and our efforts to achieve structural cost efficiency. Our wireless business has seen sustained LTE subscriber growth, underpinned by customer centric management and stronger channel competitiveness. Fixed line business saw GiGA Internet subscribers surpass 700,000-mark with IPTV subs acquisition of 6.4 million. As such, we are an unquestioned number one player in Internet and IPTV.
Through its world class ICT technology and GiGA infrastructure that integrates fixed and wireless network, KT is able to provide the fastest and most innovative telecom and converged services.
Leveraging ICT based technologies; KT is seeking to bring about conversion across various industries like advanced command and control, cloud and big data; by building intelligent GiGA infrastructure, whose value goes beyond the boundary of current level of speed, capacity and connectedness. Based on such technologies, we are focusing on five future industries of smart energy, healthcare, next generation media, integrated security and intelligent transportation control.
To facilitate market expansion of the converged business, KT is intent on developing not just a B2C model but also a B2B and B2G business models. Considering that the core of our future business is underpinned by the value of the platform dictated by the size of the subscriber base, we expected KT's future conversions business will start to become prominent starting 2016 based on different conversions business models being sought after at this moment.
Especially, in the energy sector, KT is the first in the world to have developed KT micro-energy grid, which is an integrated and efficient energy management system. At the energy control center at Mapo they predict energy demand for 280 sites around the world including hospitals, hotels and industrial facilities using big data. And the system allows for energy optimization through the conversions of production, consumption, and trading of energy resources.
KT also developed world's first portable security platform called Wiz Stick that personalizes KT's network security capabilities as one of its key initiative of its five future growth businesses in the integrated security segment. Wiz Stick manages vulnerabilities at the network access level and not at the PC level thereby blocking, pharming and other deceptive fraud attacks at its root. And by providing fingerprint identification and strong modes of authentication, we expect it will play an important role in leading the security market for financial and ecommerce transactions as well as for data protection.

KT is a telco that represents 130 years of Korea's telecommunications history. To live up to this legacy, we will further reinforce growth potential and profitability of the telco business and focus on bringing tangible outcome in the future convergence business so as to lead the wave in the fourth industrial revolution and new ICT paradigm.
Now, let me present on Q3 2015 financial results. Q3 2015 operating revenue was down 2.9% year over year to KRW5,492.2 billion and declines in fixed line and merchandize revenue. Operating profit was up 17.8% YoY to KRW343.3 billion driven by stronger core competitiveness leading to activated sales from core businesses and Company-wide cost innovations. Net income came in at KRW126 billion with EBITDA recording KRW1,174.3 billion.
Next is statement on the financial position. Q3 debt to equity ratio was 154.4% up 0.8 percentage points QoQ. Net debt ratio was 46.7% down 8.8 percentage points Q-over-Q. Next is on capital expenditure. Q3 2015 cumulative CapEx was KRW1,344.5 billion and by the end of the year we plan to implement what remains of the KRW2.7 trillion CapEx guidance.
I will now move on to each line of business. Wireless revenue came in at KRW1,844.1 billion down 3.6% year-over-year. This was due to lower interconnect revenue as a result of lowering of interconnection fees, and with the removal of the signup fee there was a decline in signup revenue. But wireless service revenue on LT subs growth continued an upper trend posting 2.4% year-over-year growth. LT subscribers expanded to account for 69.3% of total subs with Q3 ARPU recording KRW36,193 up 0.4% QoQ.
Next is on fixed line business. Fixed line revenue on PSTN revenue decline was down 6.4% year-over-year to KRW1,284.4 billion. PSTN revenue declined 11% year-over-year driven by declines in both subscribers and traffic volume. Despite growth in subscribers, broadband Internet revenue fell 1.2% year-over-year due to offering of more benefits to consumers.
Our subscribers for GiGA Internet and GiGA Wi-Fi Home, continues to rise and we believe it will help improve fixed line revenues going forward.
Next is media and contents. Media and contents revenue was up 8.2% year-over-year to KRW428.8 billon. IPTV recorded more than 180,000 net additions in Q3 and as of Q3 end, there are 6.4 million subscribers. Other VAS, value added service, revenue from media business including PPVs and ads are showing an uptrend as well. By making use of variety of content platforms within the Group such as IPTV, satellite and mobile and utilizing our content distribution capabilities in music, mobile ads and commerce, KT will strive to maintain its leadership in the media and contents industry.
Next is on financial and other revenues. Financial revenue was up 2% year-over-year on higher domestic card usage volume recording KRW835.5 billion. Other services revenue was up 28.4% recording KRW503.1 billion on higher IT/solution revenue driven by bullish global ICT business.
Next is operating expenses. Q3 operating expense came in at KRW5,148.9 billion declining 4% year-over-year. With the inclusion of KTCS, KTIS and other new subsidiaries, labor cost rose 30% year-over-year recording KRW844.3 billion. But thanks to corporate-wide cost cutting efforts through improving systems and enhancing efficiencies of work processes, business expense fell 3.1% year-over-year to KRW2,438.1 billion.
KT will continue to find ways to structurally enhance cost efficiency thereby leading to bottom line improvements. This brings me to the end of Q3 2015 earnings presentation. Thank you.
