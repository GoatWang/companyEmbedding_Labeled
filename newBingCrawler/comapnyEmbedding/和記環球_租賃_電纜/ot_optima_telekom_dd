	OT Optima Telekom dd operates in the Telephone communications, exc. radio sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares OT Optima Telekom dd with three other
	telecommunications providers in Europe:
		
	AllTele Allmanna Svenska Telefonaktiebolaget (publ)
	
		of Sweden
		(2016
	sales of 683.71 million Swedish Kronor [US$84.75  million]
		),
	
	Bredband2 I Skandinavien AB
	
		of Sweden
		(451.22 million Swedish Kronor [US$55.93  million]
		of which 100%
		was Internet/Broadband Services), and
	
	Reti Telematiche Italiane SpA
	
		which is
		
		based in Italy
		(48.13 million Euro [US$57.03  million]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	OT Optima Telekom dd reported sales of 452.05 million Croatian Kuna (US$72.24 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
				an
			
			increase of 3.8%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 435.52 million Croatian Kuna.
	
		Despite this increase, sales are still
		
			slightly
		
		below the level achieved in 2014, when OT Optima Telekom dd
		reported sales of 456.21 million Croatian Kuna.
	
		The sales level in 2016 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2011, OT Optima Telekom dd had sales
		of 486.71 million Croatian Kuna.
