Infrastrutture inaugura un impianto fotovoltaico modello in Giappone
								Questa profonda e sinergica collaborazione tra imprese italiane e giapponesi nel segno della tecnologia e del 
								rispetto dell'ambiente è sicuramente di auspicio per nuove sfide delle aziende italiane in Giappone”. Lo ha detto 
								Pier Francesco Rimbotti, fondatore e amministratore delegato del gruppo Infrastrutture, all'inaugurazione a Kumagaya 
								(in provincia di Saitama a nord di Tokyo) del secondo e più grande impianto fotovoltaico realizzato in Giappone, dopo 
								quello di Chichibu. Un impianto modello - per cui la societa' italiana ha vinto una gara pubblica nel 2013.

Infrastrutture inaugura un impianto fotovoltaico innovativo in Giappone
								Kumagaya / Saitama - Dopo il grande terremoto e con l’avvio delle politiche sulle rinnovabili del Governo giapponese negli 
								ultimi anni Infrastrutture S.p.A. e la sua partecipata Hergo Japan G.K. hanno lavorato con impegno allo sviluppo di impianti 
								di energia pulita, nelle prefetture di Saitama, Chiba, Fukushima, in particolare nel settore eolico e fotovoltaico.

Partire da zero con  un’impresa? In Giappone funziona cosi...
Intervista a Pier Francesco Rimbotti, Presidente di Infrastrutture SpA
								TOKYO - Non fa business nel settore della moda, né fa il fornitore o subfornitore di settori industriali consolidati. 
								Non si occupa di logistica internazionale, né di prodotti e servizi legati all’alimentare o al turismo. Ma ha avviato una 
								attività in Giappone. E allora, come imprenditore italiano, non può che essere stato un pioniere. Pier Francesco Rimbotti, 
								con il suo gruppo Infrastrutture, si focalizza sulle energie alternative.
