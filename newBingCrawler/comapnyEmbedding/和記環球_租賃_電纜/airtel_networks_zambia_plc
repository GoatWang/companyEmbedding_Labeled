	Airtel networks Zambia PLC provides free life insurance for millions of customers, in partnership with MicroEnsure and Focus insurance








 “Airtel Insurance” will immediately insure millions  of Zambians, growing insurance market penetration by more than 300% overnight
The Product is a life insurance scheme, provided  free on an automatic basis to all Airtel customers topping up K10 or more per  month.
By providing its customers with free  insurance, Airtel Networks Zambia Plc shows its strong commitment to care for  its customers in a time of need.


Lusaka, February 11th  2014: Airtel Networks Zambia Plc, in partnership with Focus  General Insurance Zambia Limited and MicroEnsure has made a bold move in the  market by launching a free life Insurance product for all Airtel customers  topping up with K10 or more per month. Airtel Insurance offers Airtel customers  life insurance with benefits increasing based on airtime top up amounts.
The experience  and commitment of these organisations - to provide insurance for the mass  market - has brought Airtel Insurance to the grassroots. As a free mobile  insurance product with automatic enrolment, this offer has far-reaching  implications for the Zambian population. Any Airtel customer resident in Zambia  of any age and in any region, will qualify for cover upon topping up with K10 or  more every month, making it the most widely accessible insurance cover in Zambia  and immediately insuring millions of customers and especially the Zambian  people.
  The Airtel  Insurance cover will reward Airtel customers with a monthly renewable life  cover based on the amount of airtime topped up.

  Customers  will qualify for this insurance by topping up with as little as K10  each month, and if they increase their  monthly top up amounts, they will earn more insurance cover up to K10,000  the following month as seen in the table below.

Airtel Insurance becomes available  in February 2014 and will be activated by a simple top up of K10 or more. The  cover earned each month is based on the amount topped up  the previous month.
 Airtel  Managing Director, Ms Charity Chanda Lumpa said “Airtel as a brand has always  believed in innovation whilst bringing unique, relevant products and  services to its customers in Zambia. We not only want our customers to  love our services but also cherish the relationship that we have. With  Airtel Insurance, we are providing something that has been unattainable to  many Zambians, and we are offering it for free to thank our valuable customers for  their continued support even as we simply reemphasize our deep care for our  Zambian communities.”
Focus  General Insurance Limited Managing Director, Mr Isaac Gunda, said "with  Airtel Insurance, Focus General Insurance Limited is proud to make waves in the  Zambian market.  Insurance in Zambia will  never be the same beyond today; but we do not plan to stop here.  Focus Insurance is committed to being a  pioneer and innovator in the market for Zambians from all walks of life.”
 MicroEnsure Africa, Regional Director Peter  Gross said “Airtel Insurance  is an  overnight game-changer for the nation of Zambia. For the first time in Zambia,  Airtel is providing life insurance cover for free – and immediately millions of  loyal users will benefit.  As the global  micro insurance leader, MicroEnsure is proud to offer this unprecedented  service with Airtel and Focus.”

On 22 November 2010, it was rebranded as 'Airtel'.
