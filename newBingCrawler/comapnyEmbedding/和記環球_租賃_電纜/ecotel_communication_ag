      ecotel communication ag: ecotel presents Q2 figures: positive business development confirms realignment
    

      DGAP-News: ecotel communication ag / Key word(s): Half Year Results 2016-08-11 / 08:00 The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.
      - Q2 consolidated revenue grows by EUR 5.4 million to EUR 29.2 million - Increase in Q2 B2B revenue (+ EUR 0.7 million) and gross profit (+ EUR 0.4 million) - Q2 EBITDA with special effects: EUR 1.6 million (previous year: EUR 1.8 million) - Net financial assets increased to EUR 3.0 million (previous year: EUR 0.8 million)
      
        Düsseldorf, 11 August 2016
        In the second quarter 2016 ecotel was able to continue sustainable growth, especially in the profitable core segment of Business Customers (B2B). Consolidated revenue increased by EUR 5.4 million to EUR 29.2 million. In addition to increased revenue of EUR 5.0 million in the Wholesale Solutions segment, ecotel's high-margin Business Customers (B2B) segment also improved significantly by EUR 0.7 million to EUR 11.2 million. In the New Business segment, revenue decreased slightly by EUR 0.2 million to EUR 4.2 million. In the first half year 2016 the consolidated revenue increased altogether by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 59.2 million.
        Consolidated gross profit in the second quarter 2016 increased from EUR 6.8 million to EUR 7.1 million. This was achieved essentially by Business Solutions (B2B) with an increase of EUR 0.4 million or 8 % to EUR 5.4 million. Gross profit in the New Business segment remained constant at EUR 1.7 million (previous year: EUR 1.7 million) despite the lower revenue. Altogether, ecotel earned gross profit of EUR 14.2 million in the first half year 2016 (previous year: EUR 13.8 million). Of this amount, 76.8 % is attributed to the Business Customers segment.
      

        Consolidated EBITDA in the second quarter 2016 was marked by planned one-time effects for ensuring the target growth course in the Business Customers (B2B) segment and consequently decreased to EUR 1.6 million (previous year: EUR 1.8 million). This included one-time marketing and sales costs, recruitment costs and additional investments for optimisation of processes and systems. In the first half year 2016 ecotel achieved EBITDA of EUR 3.5 million (previous year: EUR 4.5 million) and therefore remains on course. Overall, ecotel earned consolidated profit totalling EUR 0.4 million (previous year: EUR 1.1 million), which resulted in earnings per share of EUR 0.13 (previous year: EUR 0.31). The one-time revenue of EUR 1.3 million from the previous year must be taken into account in the comparison with the previous year.
      

        Free cash flow in the second quarter 2016 totalled EUR 2.0 million (Q2 2015: EUR 1.2 million). In the first half year 2016 ecotel was therefore able to achieve a free cash flow of EUR 1.0 million, so that the net financial assets increased from EUR 2.6 million at the end of 2015 to EUR 3.0 million.
      

        Equity increased by EUR 0.7 million to EUR 22.4 million (previous year: EUR 21.7 million). Despite the higher balance sheet total of EUR 45.0 million (previous year: EUR 42.6 million), ecotel was able to maintain a stable equity ratio of 49.8 %.
      

        ecotel is very satisfied with the first half year 2016. Profitable and sustainable growth in the Business Customers segment shows that ecotel is still on the right path. Meanwhile ecotel has introduced a new NGN product portfolio for the impending change from ISDN to ALL IP technology. This makes ecotel one of the first companies in the industry to be able to provide B2B customers with IP-based voice services via all access types.
        The slightly declining EBITDA in the second quarter 2016 corresponds to expectations. The company confirms the forecast published in the 2015 consolidated annual report and continues to expect revenue of EUR 95 - 105 million and EBITDA in the corridor of EUR 7.0 - 8.5 million for the current financial year 2016.

DGAP-Newsecotel communication ag: first visible results of full access product sales

ecotel communication ag  / Key word(s): Quarter Results

15.11.2010 08:29


* Stabilization of gross profit in the B2B segment
* Order backlog of more than 7,500 full access lines
* Reduction of net debt to EUR 6.5 million

Düsseldorf, November 15, 2010 

ecotel achieved revenues of EUR 72.6 million (LY: EUR 72.5 million) in the
first nine months of 2010, which are EUR 4.7 million (7%) above the
previous year figures adjusted for the deconsolidation of PPRO GmbH.
Revenues in the third quarter of 2010 were EUR 24.6 million and stable
compared with the previous quarter.  The revenue increase in the first nine
months is mainly due to new revenues in the wholesale segment and new
revenues of the subsidiary easybell in the New Business segment. Revenues
in the B2B segment were declining due to the loss of traditional preselect
revenues. Meanwhile, we see a stabilization of gross profit in this
segment. At the end of the third quarter ecotel had an order backlog of
7,500 full access lines with 3,600 active lines. Until year end ecotel
expects a doubling of active full access lines.

EBITDA in the third quarter was EUR 1.0 million and was EUR 0.2 million
lower than the EBITDA in the second quarter and stayed EUR 0.3 million
below previous year figures. The temporary reduction of EBITDA is due to
non recurring expenses. The cumulated EBITDA for the nine six months of
2010 was EUR 3.2 million (LY: EUR 3.8 million). EBIT in the third quarter
was EUR 0.2 million (LY: EUR 0.3 million). Net income for the first nine
months was EUR 0.1 million, which corresponds to earnings per share of EUR
0.03. Net debt was reduced to EUR 6.5 million.

In line with the current business development ecotel maintains its guidance
for the current business year with revenues of more than EUR 95 million and
EBITDA of more than EUR 4 million. Furthermore, ecotel expects a turnaround
in the B2B segment in the fourth quarter of 2010.

The quarterly report can be downloaded from the company's website at
www.ecotel.de.

Finanznachrichten 
DGAP-Newsecotel communication ag: ecotel starts mobile phone marketing - 'FlexiFlat Mobile' provides flexible group rates for companies of all sizes

ecotel communication ag / Product Launch

Announcement, transmitted by DGAP - a company of EquityStory AG.
The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.


From 1st October, ecotel's product range will be further enhanced by an
attractive mobile phone product for business customers. In this way, ecotel
is expanding its market position and turning into a holistic provider for
fixed network and mobile phone telephony, data and innovative internet
services. 'In introducing this attractive mobile phone rate, ecotel is one
of the first companies in the sector to be able to offer its customers
holistic services from one source on one invoice', stated Peter Zils, CEO
at ecotel communication ag.

The first ecotel mobile phone rate, 'FlexiFlat Mobile', is to be combined
with the fixed network services from ecotel. It consists of variably
selectable minutes packages that can be jointly used by all ecotel SIM
cards of the company. A particular highlight is that the individual SIM
cards do not have a contractual term and the number of cards can be
variably adjusted on a monthly basis, like the minutes packages. Only the
basic minutes package with 1,000 minutes available for €129.00 net has a
minimum contractual term of 24 months. Other additional packages with 1,000
minutes each can be selected for €99.00 net per month.

ecotel is thus setting new standards, as the previously customary
contractual terms for each SIM card no longer apply. Customers can
stipulate the minutes packages and SIM cards with total flexibility in line
with their own requirements on a monthly basis and change them at any time.

The free minutes of the packages can be used for all national calls to the
fixed line network, to all German mobile phone networks and to the mailbox.
Another plus point of the new 'FlexiFlat Mobile' rate is that these minutes
can also be used for calls from Germany to the fixed line network of
neighbouring countries (Denmark, Belgium, France, the UK, Luxemburg, the
Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic).

With immediate effect, ecotel 'FlexiFlat Mobile' can be selected as a
mobile phone option for the 'ecotel voice', 'voice-access' and
'office-flat' products. The rate is offered without a mobile phone,
although ecotel provides the option to purchase terminals via cooperation
partners. The mobile phone services, which can be activated from January
2008, will be provided via the subsidiary mvneco GmbH and processed via the
E-Plus network.

By entering the mobile phone market, ecotel is providing a holistic service
for business customers from one source, and even on one invoice, which
means great convenience for customers.


About ecotel communication ag:

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 8.23% = 1.17% + (0.8 * 8.83%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
0.53 = 0.46 (1 + (1- 21%) (19.33%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.8

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 1.17% is from the 10 year government bond rate in GB.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.

ecotel communication ag: ecotel continues its profitable growth path
ecotel communication ag / Half Year Results





Düsseldorf, 15.08.2008 (PresseBox) - 

            ecotel continues its profitable growth path in the second quarter and increases its revenues by 18% from EUR 22.0 million to EUR 26.0 million. In the first six months revenues grew by 24% from EUR 42.5 to EUR 52.9 million.

EBITDA was EUR 1.7 million and stayed on previous year level compared with the adjusted second quarter figures* of 2007. EBITDA for the first six months was EUR 3.4 million. EBIT in the second quarter was EUR 0.9 million and was on par level with the adjusted previous year results despite higher depreciation of intangible assets and 2007 investments. In the first six months EBIT was EUR 1.6 million. Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.19 and EUR 0.26 adjusted for deferred taxes.

The equity ratio grew from 45% to 46% compared with the first quarter, cash amounts to more than EUR 4 million. The generated operating cash flow is used to pay back liabilities to banks and to finance the future growth. Net debt was therefore reduced by EUR 2 million to EUR 12.0 million since the beginning of this year. ecotel considers 2008 as the year of consolidation and new orientation. The company focuses on the integration of the acquired companies and plans to leverage the synergies. Beyond this ecotel expects to identify new growth potential in all business segments.

After solid first six months the prospects continue to be positive. The company expects to continue its revenue growth in the second year of 2008 and to reach its targets. The company expects to generate revenues of EUR 100 - 110 million and to generate an EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary cost and revenues of appr. EUR 7 million.

*A comparison with the previous year figures is of limited value due to the fact that the 2007 figures contain significant one time revenues. In addition, the quarterly and first half financial figures of 2007 included insufficient provisions for 'unexpected' costs at nacamar GmbH, which were readjusted only in the third quarter of 2007.
        
Ecotel Communication AG

ecotel is a telecommunications company which operates in Germany and focuses on three business divisions.

In its core division 'Business Customers' the company offers an integrated product portfolio of voice, data and mobile services. ecotel meanwhile provides more than 45.000 business customers within Germany with standardised and individual telecommunications solutions and consistently pushes its fixed mobile convergence (FMC) strategy.

In its second division 'Wholesale Customers' the company provides carrier and wholesale services to other telecoms operators and to non-industry distributors. ecotel deploys state of the art enabling and switching platforms in order to provide its product portfolio (unbundled local loops, broadband access lines, mobile services) to other resellers. At the same time the company achieves economics of scale and broadens its value chain for its own core business 'business customers'.

The division 'New Business' contains ecotel's fast growing subsidiaries and new ventures. Apart from PPRO, easybell, ecotel private and toBEmobile this division also includes nacamar's New Media business, which has been transferred into this unit.

ecotel was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Düsseldorf. At present, the group has 220 employees. It is among the fastest growing technology companies and was ranked among the top 50 companies in the Deloitte 'Technology Fast 50' competition for the past three consecutive years.
