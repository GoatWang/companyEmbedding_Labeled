   News  CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL), VimpelCom Ltd (ADR) (VIP), Oi SA (ADR) (OIBR): The Message Is Not Important, Yields Are    Published on July 12, 2013 at 2:30 pm by

                                  in News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           As distances shorten and cables grow longer, the size of the message is ever less an issue. Holding longer conversations on the phone became worldwide reality. Communications companies CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL), VimpelCom Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:VIP), and Oi SA (ADR) (NYSE:OIBR) found success in their domestic markets and have looked at the international arena for more. Communications Int’l Stock #1  Around February, 2013, CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL) cut dividends for the first time in 40 years in order to free cash for a future buyback. Hence, after a rampant acquisition spree, the stock price plummeted with the announcement. Management then settled differences with shareholders at a fair price, and business continues to be profitable for both. In the future, CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL) will be looking to recover revenue due to inefficiencies associated with acquisitions integration. For the same reason, there are plans to build another 4,000 fiber towers and start an effective advertising strategy to drive demand and revenue. Additionally, acquisitions have been successfully integrated into the model, improving the product portfolio and increasing international presence. Financially, CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL) has a strong balance sheet. The last decade left a stable debt-to-cash ratio and revenues and free cash increased. On another note, the operating margin has decreased, remaining 4 points above the industry average (11.7). Nevertheless, it is expected to improve as acquisitions and capital invested become fully operational. Currently trading at 25.1 times its earnings, just above industry average (22.3), the stock is fairly priced. CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL) is made attractive by a 7.20% yield and the fact it is trading close to its 52-week low of $32.05. I recommend it as a long-term investment because the company holds a remarkable market position. Communications Int’l Stock #2 With operations in all continents, VimpelCom Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:VIP) has shown remarkable growth in revenue after the Great Recession. A proven business model allows for international expansion and a strong operating margin. The firm built a strong base in Russia and has subsequently moved into adjacent and then global markets. Any short-term goal for VimpelCom Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:VIP) is part of a greater strategy that began in 2007 with the acquisition of Golden, today Russia’s largest broadband provider. VimpelCom’s entrance to the Ukrainian mobile market gave the company a regional profile in 2010. But, Wind’s acquisition in 2011 took the company to sixth place among world mobile operators. So, management’s attention has recently been directed to successfully integrating acquisitions. The balance sheet for VimpelCom Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:VIP) is almost perfect. High debt levels associated with the latest acquisition have caught investors’ attention too. The good news is that a steady revenue and cash flow trend, coupled with a stabilizing operating margin 7 points above the industry average, relieves any debt worries. However, the Algerian issue may shortly disrupt the business model. Trading at 7.4 times its earnings, a 72% discount to the industry average, the stock is undervalued. Also, a 10.22% yield makes VimpelCom Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:VIP) pure gold powder. However, management infighting and the Algerian issue make the firm not suitable for long-term investment at the time. I recommend holding off until the Algerian issue is resolved.        Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All       Related Insider Monkey ArticlesShould You Buy Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
Time shown in Eastern Time unless otherwise specified.


The data contained herein from third party providers is obtained from what are considered reliable sources. However, it's accuracy, completeness, or reliability cannot be guaranteed. 


Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks

Trade-Ideas LLC identified Oi SA ADR ( OIBR) as a weak on high relative volume candidate. In addition to specific proprietary factors, Trade-Ideas identified Oi SA ADR as such a stock due to the following factors:    OIBR has an average dollar-volume (as measured by average daily share volume multiplied by share price) of $5.2 million.   OIBR has traded 315,982 shares today.   OIBR is trading at 2.07 times the normal volume for the stock at this time of day.   OIBR is trading at a new low 3.19% below yesterday's close.   'Weak on High Relative Volume' stocks are worth watching because major volume moves tend to indicate underlying activity such as material stock news, analyst downgrades, insider selling, selling from 'superinvestors,' or that hedge funds and traders are piling out of a stock ahead of a catalyst. Regardless of the impetus behind the price and volume action, when a stock moves with strength and volume it can indicate the start of a new trend on which early investors can capitalize (or avoid losses by trimming weak positions). In the event of a well-timed trading opportunity, combining technical indicators with fundamental trends and a disciplined trading methodology should help you take the first steps towards investment success.
