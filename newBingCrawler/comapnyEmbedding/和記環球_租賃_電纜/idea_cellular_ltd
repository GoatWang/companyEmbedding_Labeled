The company has recently acquired spectrum in the circles of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh (West) from Videocon Telecom in a Rs 3,310-crore deal, which will help Idea to launch its 4G services in the areas. Industry experts are of the view that the deal will give the much-needed push to Idea Cellular for launching 4G services. With this arrangement, Idea’s 4G (LTE) spectrum footprint will expand to 12 service areas covering over 75% of Idea’s current revenue and over 72% of existing 170 million quality subscribers on VLR. The agreement is for a quantum of 2×5 MHz contiguous blocks of 1800 MHz in each service area, with right to use spectrum until December 2032, which Idea Cellular intends to use for deployment of 4G (LTE) services in these service areas. The 12 circles currently contribute 60% of the Indian telecom industry mobility revenues. After completion of this transaction, Idea would have full range of Mobility Services across 2G (GSM), 3G (HSPA) and 4G (LTE) technologies in all of its 8 leadership markets of Maharashtra and Goa, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh (West). 更多Idea Cellular Ltd · 2015年12月4日 · Idea brings 3G services on 900 MHz band to Delhi with ‘DelhiNahiRukegi’ campaign. Country’s third largest telecom operator Idea Cellular today announced the commercial launch of 3G services Delhi, with a brand campaign DelhiNahiRukegi that has been built around 900 MHz network comprising 2,500 3G cell sites. The company has built the data network of 2,500 3G cell sites and 5,000 2G cell sites.⋯⋯ Ambrish Jain, Deputy Managing Director, Idea Cellular, said, “Over the last two years, Idea has invested heavily in acquiring spectrum in the most efficient 900 MHz band and setting up a future-ready, modernized network to cater to the growing demand of mobile users in the region.” The marketing campaign DelhiNahiRukegi, which began with a teaser released on November 28, 2015, will be revealed across all media starting December 5, 2015. Sashi Shankar, Chief Marketing Officer, Idea Cellular, said, “We created the DelhiNahiRukegi campaign using a metaphor where we are showing a virtual superhighway with our 3G 900. This is also the main creative for this entire campaign. The upcoming creative will highlight the plight of Delhiites in various situations, and will suggest a simple solution in the unique Idea way!” Idea has over six million subscribers in Delhi with about 30% being data users. The company is also in the process of expanding its network of service centres in the Delhi NCR region to service customers. With the launch in Delhi and the impending launch in Kolkata metro, Idea will now have its own 3G network in 13 circles which contribute to nearly 80% of the company’s revenue and 60% of industry revenue. 更多Idea Cellular Ltd · 2015年11月23日 · Idea Ultimate Plan For Heavy Internet User Now Port Your No In Idea & Take New Connection #Postpaid DL Circle⋯⋯ Inbox For More Details 更多Idea Cellular Ltd · 2015年11月19日 · NOW PAY ONLY WHEN YOU ROAM  Get all your Roaming Incoming calls Free, for only Rs.4/day⋯⋯  Features:  ·       Opt in  to this fantastic plan by dialing *150*303# - Free of Cost ·       Telescopic plan would be activated for 90 days. ·       The first Roaming Incoming call for the day would be charged @ Rs.4 and thereafter all incoming calls for the day would be free. ·       No charges would be applied if incoming calls are not received while roaming. ·       Outgoing calls would be charged at default rates.
