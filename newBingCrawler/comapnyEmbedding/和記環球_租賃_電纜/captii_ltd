Project Management


We’ve brought real-world problem solving capabilities to 90 projects (and counting), to deliver each and every one successfully from planning to completion.


A customer wanted to get a new application service launched within a very short timeframe. Implementation involved a number of parties, not just from the customer’s various network and operation teams, but also third-party system component providers. All of which was a recipe for a complicated and potentially drawn-out project, fraught with frustration. Unifiedcomms’ programme management office and project management team took charge and quickly put order to the implementation by designing and working to a project plan that launched the service in manageable phases for all stakeholders, rescheduled tasks in parallel and reallocated resources to shorten the critical path. The result? Reduced friction among all teams and happy project stakeholders, with the targeted application service launch schedule secured.
Picture a dedicated programme management office and project management team that comes armed with:

Best practice-based project management methodologies
Project Management Professional (PMP) certified professionals
Extensive on-the-ground experience delivering telecoms software, systems integration and managed service projects all over South East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle-East & Africa





Maintenance & Support


We ensure that your systems and services run like clockwork, having handled more than 100,000 support hours in helpdesk, preventative maintenance, service request fulfillment and support activity coordination services for over 30 mobile network operator and telecoms network operator customers.


A customer’s data centre was ravaged by fire, resulting in catastrophic damage and a major application service outage. In order to get service restored quickly, Unifiedcomms support responded decisively by promptly flying our personnel in-country and on-site with hand-carried replacement equipment to begin system recovery and rebuild. By being prepared and ready for contingencies, Unifiedcomms support managed to achieve application service restoration in record time when exceptional support action was most needed by the customer.
With our dedicated support team you can expect: 

High service uptime and short response times in compliance with committed SLAs
Responsive and expert personnel providing round-the-clock assistance all year round
Proven capability in supporting systems and services in operation at more than 30 operators

 




Custom Software


If you want a more customised solution, we’ve got over 200,000 development hours of experience and 339 years of combined software development knowhow among our team to build what you need.


A customer requested us to undertake the custom development of a USSD menu browser (UMB) feature. Traditionally, UMB browsers display limited menus per user, but the customer really needed to create dynamic menus which would bring up different packages and plans tuned to the specific user. They turned to Unifiedcomms for our expertise. As a result, our custom-developed dynamic UMB allowed the customer to deliver an enhanced experience for their subscribers. And they also really loved the drag-and-drop web interface, which made it really easy to create menus as and when they needed to on their own.
At your service – a software development team adept at delivering:

Telco-grade business automation software solutions
Software adaptation and systems integration services
Complete support throughout the entire development life-cycle and beyond
Coding competency in a variety of languages – C, C++, Java, PHP, .net, JSP





Managed Services


We’ve delivered and managed the operations of end-to-end solutions in over 35 large projects including a central clearinghouse system for an entire country that inter-connects with all its mobile network operators – so you don’t sweat the small stuff.


Unifiedcomms was the technical solution partner for a consortium that was selected to operate a large nationwide system that interconnected all the mobile network operators in the country and their combined base of more than 30 million subscribers. Our team was heavily involved in the design, planning, building and testing phases, resulting in the system’s successful launch on the scheduled go-live date. Since then, our managed services team has been on the job for the ongoing system management, maintenance and technical support operations activities. Our efforts all go towards providing the ultimate convenience for all stakeholders in the project.
 Leave the operational details to us so you can focus on the big picture:

Expert teams to build, deliver and manage complex systems for you

about us
















Who We Are
Established in 1998, Unifiedcomms is a leading application service provider with over 15 years of proven experience in managed application services, utility-driven value-added-services, and telecoms-grade platforms. Our application services and systems address more than 500 million subscribers of 32 mobile network operators in 15 countries across South East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
Unifiedcomms has over 180 staff at offices in Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Pakistan and India, and is a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange-listed Captii Limited (SGX:U18).










Our Beginnings
In 1998, Unifiedcomms began life as a start-up with a single office in Malaysia. From our humble beginnings as a VOIP solution provider, we developed into a global mobile telecoms-focused software developer and solution provider. We build software and systems that power value-added-services and optimise the performance of different parts of the mobile network operator’s business.
 
 







And We Got Rather Good At It 
We go the extra mile to deliver innovative and world-class, yet highly localised solutions—something which our larger competitors couldn’t manage and many of our customers truly appreciated. We reached customers and subscribers far and wide throughout South East Asia, South Asia, the Middle-East and Africa via our own local presence and a network of channel partners. We grew quickly and got listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 2004.
We even won a bunch of awards along the way: we were recognised as a Singapore SME 500 Company, received the Malaysia Golden Bull Awards for Most Outstanding SME, and was a member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu’s “Asia Pacific Technology Fast 500”.




Then Came Evolution!
Over the years, the world evolved and the markets we operated in changed. Bolt-on systems and platforms to power value-added-services became increasingly more commoditised and driven by novelty value rather than real utility. Once very popular ‘must-have’ value-added-services lost their appeal as quickly as they gained popular acceptance, and each service became increasingly more costly to market and operate. Core network technology providers began to creep into the market to provide their own, very low cost and basic versions of the most popular value-added-services to bundle into their core product offerings.
So we challenged ourselves to answer one simple question - “What can we offer that has widespread and lasting appeal for both our customers and their subscribers, that can help us be a market leader and grow?”





The Answer is Simple

Utility Applications for the Human Experience


We all have fundamental rights that can be served or aided by technology. The right to communicate. The right to control how you communicate. The right to feel safe. The right to be yourself.
In evolving from a broad-based value-added-services software and system provider to an application service provider, we have honed our focus on utility application services: to conceive, build, implement and operate application services that offer real value to subscriber by enhancing their exercise of these four fundamental rights.
However, if as a mobile network operator, you prefer the flexibility of outright owning of our platforms or application services - we’re more than happy to accommodate.
Even though we have a renewed emphasis on utility application services for mobile service subscribers, we continue to be true to our history and can provide localised and customised solutions to meet your needs, should our products not suit.



Managing Applications-as-a-Service


It is one thing to conceive and build a good application. It is entirely another thing to operate and manage the service through its lifecycle well enough to create a success story.
This is where we have placed equal emphasis in our pursuit of success stories – to ensure that we have capabilities to support the monetisation process for each and every one of our utility application services.
Working with us means that you can rely on our end-to-end service management methodology and resources to deliver the numbers you expect to see from the high-utility application service that has been launched to your subscriber segments.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com South Africa's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.
