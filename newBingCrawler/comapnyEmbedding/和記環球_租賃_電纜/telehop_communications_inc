TORONTO, July 16, 2012 /CNW/ - Telehop Communications Inc. ("Telehop") (TSX-V: HOP) announced today that it intends to complete a non-brokered private
 placement of up to $750,000 through the issuance of units (each, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") at a price of $0.10 per Unit, where each Unit consists of one common
 share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant ("Warrant"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one common share
 over a two-year period (subject to acceleration in the event that the
 closing price of the company's common shares on the TSX Venture
 Exchange, for a period of 10 consecutive trading days, exceeds $0.25
 per common share) at a price of $0.15 per common share.  Telehop may
 engage one or more finders to assist it in the sale of Units, with each
 finder receiving (i) a cash payment equal to 7.5% of the proceeds
 received by Telehop through introductions made by the respective
 finder, and (ii) warrants to purchase that number of common shares
 equal to 7.5% of the Units sold by Telehop to purchasers introduced by
 each such finder.


The proceeds of the private placement will be used by Telehop to finance
 the capital and marketing requirements needed to implement its
 strategic relationship with a leading national telecommunications
 company whereby mobile customers will be able to place overseas calls
 using Telehop's long distance services; the strategic relationship was
 announced on July 3, 2012.


All securities issued in connection with the offering will be subject to
 a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian
 securities laws. The offering is subject to the approval of the TSX
 Venture Exchange and required regulatory approvals.
