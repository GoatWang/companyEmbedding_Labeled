Median voter theorem

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

One possible model; here, if parties A and B want to catch the median voters, they should move towards the center. The red and blue areas represent the voters that A and B expect they have already captured.


The median voter theorem states that "a majority rule voting system will select the outcome most preferred by the median voter".[1]
The median voter theorem rests on two main assumptions, with several others detailed below. First, the theorem assumes that voters can place all election alternatives along a one-dimensional political spectrum.[2] It seems plausible that voters could do this if they can clearly place political candidates on a left-to-right continuum, but this is often not the case as each party will have its own policy on each of many different issues. Similarly, in the case of a referendum, the alternatives on offer may cover more than one issue. Second, the theorem assumes that voters' preferences are single-peaked, which means that voters choose the alternative closest to their own view. This assumption predicts that the further away the outcome is from the voter's most preferred outcome, the less likely the voter is to select that alternative.[3] It also assumes that voters always vote, regardless of how far the alternatives are from their own views. The median voter theorem implies that voters have an incentive to vote for their true preferences. Finally, the median voter theorem applies best to a majoritarian election system.

For the median voter theorem to be successful, there is a total of seven assumptions that are made.[4] As mentioned above, (1) the first assumption is that there is single-dimensional voting. Put simply, this means that there is only one issue that is being voted on at a time. Additionally, it is assumed that (2) voters' preferences are single-peaked, which is just the notion that people's preferences are a spectrum of utility, with the strongest preference at the maximum (see figures to the right). This assumption is critical because it prevents a phenomenon called "cycling" which is detailed below. The third assumption (3) is that voters are only choosing between two options. This is important because when there are more than two choices for voters, the median voter may not have voted for the most popular option. For example, in a population of 100 people voting between A, B, and C imagine 33 people vote for A, 33 people vote for B, and 34 people vote for C. Assuming A, B, and C lie on a spectrum (i.e. a scale from liberal to neutral to conservative) the median voter would have voted for B even though choice C was the most popular. The fourth assumption (4) is that there is no ideology or influence with regards to the voting options. Essentially, this means that politicians only care about maximizing votes, not necessarily sticking true to their beliefs. The fifth assumption (5) is that there is no selective voting and all eligible voters for an election will turn out to vote. The sixth assumption (6) says that money and lobbying have no effect on elections because introducing these incentives can dramatically change voting patterns. The final assumption (7) is the notion that all parties of elections have full information. This means that voters have knowledge on the issues, candidates have knowledge on the issues, and candidates have knowledge on voter preferences.
Explanations[edit]
To appreciate the logic of the median voter model, consider a setting where three individuals, Al, Bob, and Charlie, are to choose a restaurant for lunch. Al prefers a restaurant where lunch costs $5, Bob favors somewhat better fare at a restaurant serving $10 lunches, and Charlie wants a gourmet restaurant where lunch will cost around $20. Bob can be said to be the median voter, because there are exactly the same number of people who prefer a more expensive restaurant than Bob as there are who prefer a less expensive restaurant than Bob: here one each. For convenience assume that, given any two options, each member of the lunch group prefers restaurants with prices closer to their preferred restaurant to those that are farther from it. Now consider some majority decisions over alternative restaurants:


Options
Pattern of votes
Result


$20 vs. $5
A: 5
B: 5
C: 20
5


$10 vs. $20
A: 10
B: 10
C: 20
10


$10 vs. $5
A: 5
B: 10
C: 10
10


The weak form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always casts his or her vote for the policy that is adopted. Note that Bob always votes in favor of the outcome that wins the election. Note also that Bob's preferred $10 restaurant will defeat any other. If there is a median voter, his or her preferred policy will beat any other alternative in a pairwise vote. (The median voter's ideal point is always a Condorcet winner.) Consequently, once the median voter's preferred outcome is reached, it cannot be defeated by another in a pairwise majoritarian election. The strong form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always gets his most preferred policy.[5]
The median voter theorem seems to explain some of the things that happen in majoritarian voting systems. First, it may explain why politicians tend to adopt similar platforms and campaign rhetoric. In order to win the majority vote, politicians must tailor their platforms to the median voter.[2] For example, in the United States, the Democratic and Republican candidates typically move their campaign platforms towards the middle during congressional election campaigns. Just as sellers in a free market try to win over their competitors' customers by making slight changes to improve their products, so too do politicians deviate only slightly from their opponent's platform so as to gain votes.[2]
Second, the median voter theorem reflects that radical candidates or parties rarely get elected. For example, a politician or party which is at an extreme end of the political spectrum will usually not get nearly as many votes as a more moderate party. Finally, the theorem may explain why two major political parties tend to emerge in majoritarian voting systems (Duverger's law). In the United States there are countless political parties, but only two established major parties play a part in almost every major election: the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the median voter theorem third parties will rarely, if ever, win elections for the same reason why extreme candidates do not tend to win. The major parties tend to co-opt the platforms of the minor parties in order to secure more votes.[1] In many other long-established democratic countries there are several parties who each get a substantial share of the vote, although most of these have some form of proportional representation.
History[edit]
In his 1929 paper titled Stability in Competition, Harold Hotelling notes in passing that political candidates' platforms seem to converge during majoritarian elections.[2] Hotelling compared political elections to businesses in the private sector. He postulated that just as there is often not much difference between the products of different competing companies, so, too, there is not a stark contrast between electoral platforms of different parties. This is because politicians, just like salesmen with consumers, seek to capture the majority of voters. Duncan Black, in his 1948 paper titled On the Rationale of Group Decision-making, provided a formal analysis of majority voting that made the theorem and its assumptions explicit.[6] Black wrote that he saw a large gap in economic theory concerning how voting determines the outcome of decisions, including political decisions. Black's paper thus triggered research on how economics can explain voting systems. In 1957 with his paper titled An Economic Theory of Political Action in Democracy, Anthony Downs expounded upon the median voter theorem.[7]
Accuracy[edit]
Several important economic studies strongly support the median voter theorem. For example, Holcombe analyzes the Bowen equilibrium level of education expenditures for 257 Michigan school districts and finds that the actual expenditures are only about 3% away from the estimated district average.[8]
The theorem also explains the rise in government redistribution programs over the past few decades. Thomas Husted and Lawrence W. Kenny examined growth of redistribution programs especially between the years of 1950 and 1988.[9] Tom Rice also writes that voters with the median income will take advantage of their status as deciders by electing politicians who will tax those who are earning more than the median voter, and then redistribute the money, including to those who are at the median.[10] More specifically, Rice demonstrates that if a systematic closing of the gap between the median and mean income levels in the United States could be shown, more credibility could be given to the median voter theorem. Until the mid-1960s, Rice says that the gap between median and mean income levels tightened. Three main forces served to tighten this gap. First, the strength of the Democratic Party in the United States Congress in the decades leading up to the 1960s, as Democrats are more disposed to redistribution of wealth. Second, increased turnout at the polls, just as Husted and Kenny postulated, tightened the gap because an increase in voters means more individuals of lower income are voting. Finally, since unemployment, which causes median income families to fall below the median income[citation needed], was relatively low compared to after the 1960s, this tightened the gap.
Limitations[edit]
Abstract Social Choice Problem[edit]
How do we choose the best outcome from an election for society? This question is the root of the median voter theorem and provides the basis for how and why this theorem was created. It starts with the idea of a "social decision rule." Essentially, this is a tool that is used to aggregate preferences of all members of society that, ultimately, provides a clear-cut and consistent answer for what outcome is most preferred. This choice rests on three main principles that allow the most preferred social choice to be salient. The first (1) is Pareto Dominance. This is the idea that if society prefers one choice to all other choices, the social decision should reflect this and this option will be the outcome. The second principle (2) is a concept called transitivity, which is analog to the mathematical property. This phenomenon simply means that if option A is preferred to option B, and option B is preferred to option C, then option A is preferred to option C. The final principle (3)is the idea of independence of irrelevant alternatives. This suggests that if something is not relevant to the election or the issues involved, then it should not affect the outcome or results. For example, imagine there is a vote for the Most Valuable Player in a baseball league and player A has the most votes, player B has the second most and player C has the third most. Now, say, player C is disqualified for cheating - this should not change the outcome of the vote. If the voting system was set up in a way in which aggregate votes are shifted and player B ends up with more votes, this is not a consistent aggregation method.[4]
Cycling[4][edit]
If any of the above-mentioned principles is violated, it could result in cycling. Cycling happens when there is no clear winner from a majority vote that results in a constant cycle of trying to determine which outcome is most preferred. This is a crucial concept because it exposes how majority voting in general and the median voter theorem can fail when assumptions are not met. There are several more failures that come about from this model that stem from this phenomenon.
Arrow's Impossibility Theorem[edit]
With the difficulties associated with aggregating society's preferences, what are some alternatives that can be considered? Potentially, members of society could simply vote for their first choice rather than rank their preferences. Alternatively, there could be weights distributed based on the intensity and passion that members feel for specific issues. Both of these are problematic for several reasons, including the frequent occurrences of ties. In 1951, Kenneth Arrow received the Nobel Prize in economics for a theorem based on these challenges with aggregating preferences consistently. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that there is no general solution to the abstract social choice problem. Arrow had the insight to realize that numerous individuals of different demographics and geography cannot all have consistent and similar political, socioeconomic, or many other beliefs. Arrow found that the only way for the social choice problem to have a single solution was to either (1) restrict individual preferences to certain and specific bundles or (2) impose a dictatorship.[4] In reality, it seems that the party system in the United States and in other countries restricts your political beliefs to one side or the other.
Two Common Solutions[edit]
Restrict preferences to single peaks, meaning that individuals vote on a spectrum and allow the median voter theorem to be implemented naturally.This is essentially the function of the party system mentioned briefly above. Another common solution is to allow people's intensities on issues play a factor in their vote. This is difficult to achieve since both social welfare functions and the Samuelson rule are necessary to calculate.
Political[edit]
In reality, many of the assumptions of this model do not hold. One assumption the theorem makes is that there is only single dimensional voting. This is never true of government representatives - politicians do not only take stances on only one issue but rather several. To test the median voter theorem further, think about the Senate. If the median voter theorem holds, it would mean that the two Senators from a state should vote the same way every time because the median voter in the state would be the voter that chooses the outcome. However, when there is one democratic Senator and one republican, they typically vote opposite to each other, effectively canceling each others' votes.
The median voter theorem has several limitations. Keith Krehbiel postulates that there are many factors which prevent the political process from reaching maximum efficiency.[11] Just as transaction costs prevent efficiency in market exchanges, the limitations of the majoritarian voting process stop it from reaching optimality. With the median voter theorem in particular, Krehbiel argues that voters' inability to directly amend legislation acts against the theorem. Sometimes, as Krehbiel writes, the policies being voted on are too complex to be placed within a one-dimensional continuum. Buchanan and Tollison also note that this is a problem for the median voter theorem, which assumes that decisions can be made on a one-dimensional field.[12] If voters are considering more than one issue simultaneously, the median voter theorem is inapplicable. This may happen if, for example, voters may vote on a referendum regarding education spending and police spending simultaneously.
A larger problem for the median voter theorem, however, is the incentives structure for government representatives. Downs, in A Theory of Bureaucracy, writes that people's decisions are motivated by self-interest, an idea deeply rooted in the writings of Adam Smith.[13] This holds for the government system as well, because it is composed of individuals who are self-interested. One cannot guarantee the degree to which a government representative will be committed to the public good, but it is certain that, to some degree, they will be committed to their own set of goals. These goals can include a desire to serve the public interest, but most often they include the desire for power, income, and prestige. To continue obtaining these things, then, officials must secure re-election. When representatives are constantly focused on becoming re-elected, this distorts the mandate they receive from their constituents: representatives will translate the wishes of their constituents into benefits for themselves.[13] They will tend to vote for short-term policies that they hope will get them reelected.[1]

This article is about the statistical concept. For other uses, see Median (disambiguation).




Finding the median in sets of data with an odd and even number of values.


The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half. For a data set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it.
The median is a commonly used measure of the properties of a data set in statistics and probability theory. The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the "average") is that it is not skewed so much by extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a 'typical' value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets which vary greatly, a mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a 'typical' income is.
Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result.

Finite set of numbers[edit]
The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the numbers from smallest to greatest.
If there is an odd number of numbers, the middle one is picked. For example, consider the set of numbers

1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9

This set contains seven numbers. The median is the fourth of them, which is 6.
If there are an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values.[1][2] For example, in the data set

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

the median is the mean of the middle two numbers: this is (4 + 5) ÷ 2, which is 4.5. (In more technical terms, this interprets the median as the fully trimmed mid-range.)
The formula used to find the middle number of a data set of n numerically ordered numbers is (n + 1) ÷ 2. This either gives the middle number (for an odd number of values) or the halfway point between the two middle values. For example, with 14 values, the formula will give 7.5, and the median will be taken by averaging the seventh and eighth values.
One can find the median using the Stem-and-Leaf Plot.
There is no widely accepted standard notation for the median, but some authors represent the median of a variable x either as x͂ or as μ1/2[1] sometimes also M.[3][4] In any of these cases, the use of these or other symbols for the median needs to be explicitly defined when they are introduced.
The median is used primarily for skewed distributions, which it summarizes differently from the arithmetic mean. Consider the multiset { 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 14 }. The median is 2 in this case, (as is the mode), and it might be seen as a better indication of central tendency (less susceptible to the exceptionally large value in data) than the arithmetic mean of 4.
The median is a popular summary statistic used in descriptive statistics, since it is simple to understand and easy to calculate, while also giving a measure that is more robust in the presence of outlier values than is the mean. The widely cited empirical relationship between the relative locations of the mean and the median for skewed distributions is, however, not generally true.[5] There are, however, various relationships for the absolute difference between them; see below.
With an even number of observations (as shown above) no value need be exactly at the value of the median. Nonetheless, the value of the median is uniquely determined with the usual definition. A related concept, in which the outcome is forced to correspond to a member of the sample, is the medoid.
In a population, at most half have values strictly less than the median and at most half have values strictly greater than it. If each group contains less than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the median. For example, if a < b < c, then the median of the list {a, b, c} is b, and, if a < b < c < d, then the median of the list {a, b, c, d} is the mean of b and c; i.e., it is (b + c)/2. Indeed, as it is based on the middle data in a group, it is not necessary to even know the value of extreme results in order to calculate a median. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated.[6]
The median can be used as a measure of location when a distribution is skewed, when end-values are not known, or when one requires reduced importance to be attached to outliers, e.g., because they may be measurement errors.
A median is only defined on ordered one-dimensional data, and is independent of any distance metric. A geometric median, on the other hand, is defined in any number of dimensions.
The median is one of a number of ways of summarising the typical values associated with members of a statistical population; thus, it is a possible location parameter. The median is the 2nd quartile, 5th decile, and 50th percentile. Since the median is the same as the second quartile, its calculation is illustrated in the article on quartiles. A median can be worked out for ranked but not numerical classes (e.g. working out a median grade when students are graded from A to F), although the result might be halfway between grades if there are an even number of cases.
When the median is used as a location parameter in descriptive statistics, there are several choices for a measure of variability: the range, the interquartile range, the mean absolute deviation, and the median absolute deviation.
For practical purposes, different measures of location and dispersion are often compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient than the sample median when data are uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions, but less efficient otherwise, and that the efficiency of the sample median is higher than that for a wide range of distributions. More specifically, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean—see asymptotic efficiency and references therein.
Probability distributions[edit]

For any probability distribution on the real line R with cumulative distribution function F, regardless of whether it is any kind of continuous probability distribution, in particular an absolutely continuous distribution (which has a probability density function), or a discrete probability distribution, a median is by definition any real number m that satisfies the inequalities

Any probability distribution on R has at least one median, but there may be more than one median. Where exactly one median exists, statisticians speak of "the median" correctly; even when the median is not unique, some statisticians speak of "the median" informally.
Medians of particular distributions[edit]
The medians of certain types of distributions can be easily calculated from their parameters; furthermore, they exist even for some distributions lacking a well-defined mean, such as the Cauchy distribution:

The median of a symmetric unimodal distribution coincides with the mode.
The median of a symmetric distribution which possesses a mean μ also takes the value μ.

The median of a normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ2 is μ. In fact, for a normal distribution, mean = median = mode.
The median of a uniform distribution in the interval [a, b] is (a + b) / 2, which is also the mean.


The median of a Cauchy distribution with location parameter x0 and scale parameter y is x0, the location parameter.
The median of a power law distribution x−a, with exponent a > 1 is 21/(a − 1)xmin, where xmin is the minimum value for which the power law holds[8]
The median of an exponential distribution with rate parameter λ is the natural logarithm of 2 divided by the rate parameter: λ−1ln 2.
The median of a Weibull distribution with shape parameter k and scale parameter λ is λ(ln 2)1/k.

Populations[edit]
Optimality property[edit]
The mean absolute error of a real variable c with respect to the random variable X is





E
(

|
X
−
c
|

)



{\displaystyle E(\left|X-c\right|)\,}



Provided that the probability distribution of X is such that the above expectation exists, then m is a median of X if and only if m is a minimizer of the mean absolute error with respect to X.[9] In particular, m is a sample median if and only if m minimizes the arithmetic mean of the absolute deviations.
More generally, a median is defined as a minimum of





E
(

|

X
−
c

|

−

|

X

|

)
,


{\displaystyle E(|X-c|-|X|),}



as discussed below in the section on multivariate medians (specifically, the spatial median).
This optimization-based definition of the median is useful in statistical data-analysis, for example, in k-medians clustering.
Unimodal distributions[edit]




Comparison of mean, median and mode of two log-normal distributions with different skewness.


It can be shown for a unimodal distribution that the median

{\displaystyle {\tilde {X}}}

 and the mean

{\displaystyle {\bar {X}}}

 lie within (3/5)1/2 ≈ 0.7746 standard deviations of each other.[10] In symbols,

where |·| is the absolute value.
A similar relation holds between the median and the mode: they lie within 31/2 ≈ 1.732 standard deviations of each other:

{\displaystyle {\frac {|{\tilde {X}}-\mathrm {mode} |}{\sigma }}\leq 3^{\frac {1}{2}}.}



Inequality relating means and medians[edit]
If the distribution has finite variance, then the distance between the median and the mean is bounded by one standard deviation.
This bound was proved by Mallows,[11] who used Jensen's inequality twice, as follows. We have

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|\mu -m|=|\operatorname {E} (X-m)|&\leq \operatorname {E} (|X-m|)\\&\leq \operatorname {E} (|X-\mu |)\\&\leq {\sqrt {\operatorname {E} \left((X-\mu )^{2}\right)}}=\sigma .\end{aligned}}}



The first and third inequalities come from Jensen's inequality applied to the absolute-value function and the square function, which are each convex. The second inequality comes from the fact that a median minimizes the absolute deviation function





a

X

.



{\displaystyle a\mapsto \operatorname {E} (|X-a|).\,}



This proof also follows directly from Cantelli's inequality.[12] The result can be generalized to obtain a multivariate version of the inequality,[13] as follows:

where m is a spatial median, that is, a minimizer of the function 



a

E
⁡
(
∥
X
−
a
∥
)
.



{\displaystyle a\mapsto \operatorname {E} (\|X-a\|).\,}

 The spatial median is unique when the data-set's dimension is two or more.[14][15] An alternative proof uses the one-sided Chebyshev inequality; it appears in an inequality on location and scale parameters.
Jensen's inequality for medians[edit]
Jensen's inequality states that for any random variable x with a ﬁnite expectation E(x) and for any convex function f





f
[
E
(
x
)
]
≤
E
[
f
(
x
)
]


{\displaystyle f[E(x)]\leq E[f(x)]}



It has been shown[16] that if x is a real variable with a unique median m and f is a C function then





f
(
m
)
≤
Median
⁡
[
f

{\displaystyle f(m)\leq \operatorname {Median} [f(x)]}



A C function is a real valued function, defined on the set of real numbers R, with the property that for any real t

is a closed interval, a singleton or an empty set.
Medians for samples[edit]
The sample median[edit]
  Efficient computation of the sample median[edit]
Even though comparison-sorting n items requires Ω(n log n) operations, selection algorithms can compute the k'th-smallest of n items with only Θ(n) operations. This includes the median, which is the n/2'th order statistic (or for an even number of samples, the arithmetic mean of the two middle order statistics).
Selection algorithms still have the downside of requiring Ω(n) memory, that is, they need to have the full sample (or a linear-sized portion of it) in memory. Because this, as well as the linear time requirement, can be prohibitive, several estimation procedures for the median have been developed. A simple one is the median of three rule, which estimates the median as the median of a three-element subsample; this is commonly used as a subroutine in the quicksort sorting algorithm, which uses an estimate of its input's median. A more robust estimator is Tukey's ninther, which is the median of three rule applied with limited recursion:[17] if A is the sample laid out as an array, and

med3(A) = median(A[1], A[n/2], A[n]),

then

ninther(A) = med3(med3(A[1 ... 1/3n]), med3(A[1/3n ... 2/3n]), med3(A[2/3n ... n]))

The remedian is an estimator for the median that requires linear time but sub-linear memory, operating in a single pass over the sample.[18]
Easy explanation of the sample median[edit]
In individual series (if number of observation is very low) first one must arrange all the observations in order. Then count(n) is the total number of observation in given data.
If n is odd then Median (M) = value of ((n + 1)/2)th item term.
If n is even then Median (M) = value of [(n/2)th item term + (n/2 + 1)th item term]/2

For an odd number of values

As an example, we will calculate the sample median for the following set of observations: 1, 5, 2, 8, 7.
Start by sorting the values: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8.
In this case, the median is 5 since it is the middle observation in the ordered list.
The median is the ((n + 1)/2)th item, where n is the number of values. For example, for the list {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}, we have n = 5, so the median is the ((5 + 1)/2)th item.

median = (6/2)th item
median = 3rd item
median = 5


For an even number of values

As an example, we will calculate the sample median for the following set of observations: 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 2.
Start by sorting the values: 1, 2, 2, 6, 7, 8.
In this case, the arithmetic mean of the two middlemost terms is (2 + 6)/2 = 4. Therefore, the median is 4 since it is the arithmetic mean of the middle observations in the ordered list.
We also use this formula MEDIAN = {(n + 1 )/2}th item . n = number of values
As above example 1, 2, 2, 6, 7, 8 n = 6 Median = {(6 + 1)/2}th item = 3.5th item. In this case, the median is average of the 3rd number and the next one (the fourth number). The median is (2 + 6)/2 which is 4.
Sampling distribution[edit]
The distributions of both the sample mean and the sample median were determined by Laplace.[19] The distribution of the sample median from a population with a density function 



f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)}

 is asymptotically normal with mean 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 and variance[20]

n
f
(
m

)

2







{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4nf(m)^{2}}}}



where 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 is the median of 



f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)}

 and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is the sample size.
These results have also been extended.[21] It is now known for the 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-th quantile that the distribution of the sample 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-th quantile is asymptotically normal around the 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-th quantile with variance equal to








p
(

−
p
)


n
f
(

x

p



)

2







{\displaystyle {\frac {p(1-p)}{nf(x_{p})^{2}}}}



where 



f
(

x

p


)


{\displaystyle f(x_{p})}

 is the value of the distribution density at the 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-th quantile.
In the case of a discrete variable, the sampling distribution of the median for small-samples can be investigated as follows. We take the sample size to be an odd number 



N
=
2
n
+
1


{\displaystyle N=2n+1}

. If a given value 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 is to be the median of the sample then two conditions must be satisfied. The first is that at most 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 observations can have a value of 



v
−
1


{\displaystyle v-1}

 or less. The second is that at most 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 observations can have a value of 



v
+
1


{\displaystyle v+1}

 or more. Let 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 be the number of observations which have a value of 



v
−
1


{\displaystyle v-1}

 or less and let 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 be the number of observations which have a value of 



v
+
1


{\displaystyle v+1}

 or more. Then 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 and 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 both have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. If an observation has a value below 



v


{\displaystyle v}

, it is not relevant how far below 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 it is and conversely, if an observation has a value above 



v


{\displaystyle v}

, it is not relevant how far above 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 it is. We can therefore represent the observations as following a trinomial distribution with probabilities 



F
(
v
−
1
)


{\displaystyle F(v-1)}

, 



f
(
v
)


{\displaystyle f(v)}

 and 



1
−
F
(
v
)


{\displaystyle 1-F(v)}

. The probability that the median 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 will have a value 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 is then given by





Pr
(
m
=
v
)
=

∑

i
=
0

Summing this over all values of 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 defines a proper distribution and gives a unit sum. In practice, the function 



f
(
v
)


{\displaystyle f(v)}

 will often not be known but it can be estimated from an observed frequency distribution. An example is given in the following table where the actual distribution is not known but a sample of 3,800 observations allows a sufficiently accurate assessment of

Using these data it is possible to investigate the effect of sample size on the standard errors of the mean and median. The observed mean is 3.16, the observed raw median is 3 and the observed interpolated median is 3.174. The following table gives some comparison statistics. The standard error of the median is given both from the above expression for 



p
r
(
m
=
v
)


{\displaystyle pr(m=v)}

 and from the asymptotic approximation given earlier.

The expected value of the median falls slightly as sample size increases while, as would be expected, the standard errors of both the median and the mean are proportionate to the inverse square root of the sample size. The asymptotic approximation errs on the side of caution by overestimating the standard error.
In the case of a continuous variable, the following argument can be used. If a given value 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 is to be the median, then one observation must take the value 



v


{\displaystyle v}

. The elemental probability of this is 



f
(
v
)

d
v


{\displaystyle f(v)\,dv}

. Then, of the remaining 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 observations, exactly 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 of them must be above 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 and the remaining 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 below. The probability of this is the 



n


{\displaystyle n}

th term of a binomial distribution with parameters 



F
(
v
)


{\displaystyle F(v)}

 and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

. Finally we multiply by 



2
n
+
1


{\displaystyle 2n+1}

 since any of the observations in the sample can be the median observation. Hence the elemental probability of the median at the point 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 is given by





f

Now we introduce the beta function. For integer arguments 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 and 



β


{\displaystyle \beta }

, this can be expressed as 




B

(
α
,
β
)
=
(
α
−
1
)
!
(
β

α
+
β
−
1
)
!


{\displaystyle \mathrm {B} (\alpha ,\beta )=(\alpha -1)!(\beta -1)!/(\alpha +\beta -1)!}

. Also, we note that 



f
(
v
)
=
d
F
(
v
)

/

d
v


{\displaystyle f(v)=dF(v)/dv}

. Using these relationships and setting both 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 and 



β


{\displaystyle \beta }

 equal to 



(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle (n+1)}

 allows the last expression to be written as








[
F
(
v
)

]

n


[
1

F

)




d
F
(
v
)


{\displaystyle {\frac {[F(v)]^{n}[1-F(v)]^{n}}{\mathrm {B} (n+1,n+1)}}\,dF(v)}



Hence the density function of the median is a symmetric beta distribution over the unit interval which supports 



F
(
v
)


{\displaystyle F(v)}

. Its mean, as we would expect, is 0.5 and its variance is 



1

/

(
4
(
N
+
2
)
)


{\displaystyle 1/(4(N+2))}

. The corresponding variance of the sample median is

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4(N+2)f(m)^{2}}}.}



However this finding can only be used if the density function 



f
(
v
)


{\displaystyle f(v)}

 is known or can be assumed. As this will not always be the case, the median variance has to be estimated sometimes from the sample data.

k


{\displaystyle k}

 grows with the sample size has been shown to be asymptotically consistent.[23] This method may be computationally expensive for large data sets. A bootstrap estimate is known to be consistent,[24] but converges very slowly (order of 




n

−

{\displaystyle n^{-{\frac {1}{4}}}}

).[25] Other methods have been proposed but their behavior may differ between large and small samples.[26]

Efficiency

The efficiency of the sample median, measured as the ratio of the variance of the mean to the variance of the median, depends on the sample size and on the underlying population distribution. For a sample of size 



N
=
2
n
+
1


{\displaystyle N=2n+1}

 from the normal distribution, the efficiency for large N is







2
π





N
+
2

N




{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{\pi }}{\frac {N+2}{N}}}



The efficiency tends to 





2
π




{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{\pi }}}

 as 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 tends to infinity.
Other estimators[edit]
For univariate distributions that are symmetric about one median, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median.[27]
If data are represented by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distributions, then estimates of the median can be obtained by fitting that family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution.[citation needed] Pareto interpolation is an application of this when the population is assumed to have a Pareto distribution.
Coefficient of dispersion[edit]
The coefficient of dispersion (CD) is defined as the ratio of the average absolute deviation from the median to the median of the data.[28] It is a statistical measure used by the states of Iowa, New York and South Dakota in estimating dues taxes.[29][30][31] In symbols

Confidence intervals for a two sample test where the sample sizes are large have been derived by Bonett and Seier[28] This test assumes that both samples have the same median but differ in the dispersion around it. The confidence interval (CI) is bounded inferiorly by

Multivariate median[edit]
Previously, this article discussed the univariate median, when the sample or population had one-dimension. When the dimension is two or higher, there are multiple concepts that extend the definition of the univariate median; each such multivariate median agrees with the univariate median when the dimension is exactly one.[27][32][33][34]
Marginal median[edit]
The marginal median is defined for vectors defined with respect to a fixed set of coordinates. A marginal median is defined to be the vector whose components are univariate medians. The marginal median is easy to compute, and its properties were studied by Puri and Sen.[27][35]
Spatial median[edit]

For N vectors in a normed vector space, a spatial median minimizes the average distance





a
↦


1
N



∑

n


(
∥

x

n


−
a
∥
)
,



{\displaystyle a\mapsto {\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{n}(\|x_{n}-a\|),\,}



where xn and a are vectors. The spatial median is unique when the data-set's dimension is two or more and the norm is the Euclidean norm (or another strictly convex norm).[14][15][27] The spatial median is also called the L1 median, even when the norm is Euclidean. Other names are used especially for finite sets of points: geometric median, Fermat point (in mechanics), or Weber or Fermat-Weber point (in geographical location theory).[36]
More generally, a spatial median is defined as a minimizer of





a
↦


1
N



∑

n



(
∥

x

n


−
a
∥
−
∥

x

n


∥
)

;


{\displaystyle a\mapsto {\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{n}{(\|x_{n}-a\|-\|x_{n}\|)};}

[27][37]

this general definition is convenient for defining a spatial median of a population in a finite-dimensional normed space, for example, for distributions without a finite mean.[14][27] Spatial medians are defined for random vectors with values in a Banach space.[14]
The spatial median is a robust and highly efficient estimator of a central tendency of a population.[27][37][38][39]
Other multivariate medians[edit]
An alternative generalization of the spatial median in higher dimensions that does not relate to a particular metric is the centerpoint.
Other median-related concepts[edit]
Interpolated median[edit]
When dealing with a discrete variable, it is sometimes useful to regard the observed values as being midpoints of underlying continuous intervals. An example of this is a Likert scale where opinions or preferences are expressed on a scale with a set number of possible responses. If the scale consists of the positive integers, an observation of 3 might be regarded as representing the interval from 2.50 to 3.50. It is possible to estimate the median of the underlying variable. If say 22% of the observations are of value 2 or below and 55.0% are of 3 or below (so 33% have the value 3), then the median 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 is 3 since the median is the smallest value of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 for which 



F
(
x

{\displaystyle F(x)}

 is greater than a half. But the interpolated median is somewhere between 2.50 and 3.50. First we add half of the interval width 



w


{\displaystyle w}

 to the median to get the upper bound of the median interval. Then we subtract that proportion of the interval width which equals the proportion of the 33% which lies above the 50% mark. In other words, we split up the interval width pro rata to the numbers of observations. In this case, the 33% is split into 28% below the median and 5% above it so we subtract 5/33 of the interval width from the upper bound of 3.50 to give an interpolated median of 3.35. More formally, if the values 



f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)}

 are known, the interpolated median can be calculated from






m

int


=
m
+
w

[


1
2

)
−

2




f

)



]

.


{\displaystyle m_{\text{int}}=m+w\left[{\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {F(m)-{\frac {1}{2}}}{f(m)}}\right].}



Alternatively, if in an observed sample there are 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 scores above the median category, 



j


{\displaystyle j}

 scores in it and 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 scores below it then the interpolated median is given by






m

int


=
m
+


w
2



[



k
−
i

j


]

.


{\displaystyle m_{\text{int}}=m+{\frac {w}{2}}\left[{\frac {k-i}{j}}\right].}



Pseudo-median[edit]
For univariate distributions that are symmetric about one median, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population pseudo-median, which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median.[citation needed] The Hodges–Lehmann estimator has been generalized to multivariate distributions.[37]
Variants of regression[edit]
The Theil–Sen estimator is a method for robust linear regression based on finding medians of slopes.[40]
Median filter[edit]
Main article: Median filter
In the context of image processing of monochrome raster images there is a type of noise, known as the salt and pepper noise, when each pixel independently becomes black (with some small probability) or white (with some small probability), and is unchanged otherwise (with the probability close to 1). An image constructed of median values of neighborhoods (like 3×3 square) can effectively reduce noise in this case.[citation needed]
Cluster analysis[edit]
Main article: k-medians clustering
In cluster analysis, the k-medians clustering algorithm provides a way of defining clusters, in which the criterion of maximising the distance between cluster-means that is used in k-means clustering, is replaced by maximising the distance between cluster-medians.
Median–median line[edit]
This is a method of robust regression. The idea dates back to Wald in 1940 who suggested dividing a set of bivariate data into two halves depending on the value of the independent parameter 



x


{\displaystyle x}

: a left half with values less than the median and a right half with values greater than the median.[41] He suggested taking the means of the dependent 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 and independent 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 variables of the left and the right halves and estimating the slope of the line joining these two points. The line could then be adjusted to fit the majority of the points in the data set.
Nair and Shrivastava in 1942 suggested a similar idea but instead advocated dividing the sample into three equal parts before calculating the means of the subsamples.[42] Brown and Mood in 1951 proposed the idea of using the medians of two subsamples rather the means.[43] Tukey combined these ideas and recommended dividing the sample into three equal size subsamples and estimating the line based on the medians of the subsamples.[44]
Median-unbiased estimators[edit]
Main article: Bias of an estimator § Median-unbiased estimators
Any mean-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk (expected loss) with respect to the squared-error loss function, as observed by Gauss. A median-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk with respect to the absolute-deviation loss function, as observed by Laplace. Other loss functions are used in statistical theory, particularly in robust statistics.
The theory of median-unbiased estimators was revived by George W. Brown in 1947:[45]

An estimate of a one-dimensional parameter θ will be said to be median-unbiased if, for fixed θ, the median of the distribution of the estimate is at the value θ; i.e., the estimate underestimates just as often as it overestimates. This requirement seems for most purposes to accomplish as much as the mean-unbiased requirement and has the additional property that it is invariant under one-to-one transformation.
— page 584

Further properties of median-unbiased estimators have been reported.[46][47][48][49] Median-unbiased estimators are invariant under one-to-one transformations.
There are methods of construction median-unbiased estimators that are optimal (in a sense analogous to minimum-variance property considered for mean-unbiased estimators). Such constructions exist for probability distributions having monotone likelihood-functions.[50][51] One such procedure is an analogue of the Rao–Blackwell procedure for mean-unbiased estimators: The procedure holds for a smaller class of probability distributions than does the Rao—Blackwell procedure but for a larger class of loss functions.[52]
History[edit]
The idea of the median appeared in the 13th century in the Talmud [53][54] (further[citation needed] for possible older mentions)
The idea of the median also appeared later in Edward Wright's book on navigation (Certaine Errors in Navigation) in 1599 in a section concerning the determination of location with a compass. Wright felt that this value was the most likely to be the correct value in a series of observations.
In 1757, Roger Joseph Boscovich developed a regression method based on the L1 norm and therefore implicitly on the median.[55]
In 1774, Laplace suggested the median be used as the standard estimator of the value of a posterior pdf. The specific criterion was to minimize the expected magnitude of the error; 




|

α
−

α

∗



|



{\displaystyle |\alpha -\alpha ^{*}|}

 where 




α

∗




{\displaystyle \alpha ^{*}}

 is the estimate and 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 is the true value. Laplaces's criterion was generally rejected for 150 years in favor of the least squares method of Gauss and Legendre which minimizes 



(
α
−

α

∗



)

2




{\displaystyle (\alpha -\alpha ^{*})^{2}}

 to obtain the mean.[56] The distribution of both the sample mean and the sample median were determined by Laplace in the early 1800s.[19][57]
Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1843 was the first[citation needed] to use the term median (valeur médiane) for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves. Gustav Theodor Fechner used the median (Centralwerth) in sociological and psychological phenomena.[58] It had earlier been used only in astronomy and related fields. Gustav Fechner popularized the median into the formal analysis of data, although it had been used previously by Laplace.[58]
Francis Galton used the English term median in 1881,[59] having earlier used the terms middle-most value in 1869 and the medium in 1880.[citation needed]

Private Media Group, Inc. is a Swedish production and distribution company that distributes adult entertainment via print publications, DVDs, the internet, and mobile.
Private magazine was established in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1965 as the world's first full-color hardcore magazine by Berth Milton, Sr. In the early 1990s, his son Berth Milton, Jr. took over and moved the company's headquarters to Sant Cugat del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain, although the company is incorporated in Nevada. Milton also started to produce movies and internet content, taking Private public soon after.[1]

It's also expected that Private and Dorcel will join forces in distribution platforms including Internet and IPTV/VOD in both France and across the EU.[5]
The firm's 2009 acquisitions of video on demand companies Gamelink LLC and Sureflix, and the ecommerce technology firm eLine LLC established it as a leading adult content and distribution company in the digital media sector.[6][7]
In June 2014 the firm announced the released of its full archive of images and (film and video) scenes dating back to the 1960s when Private magazine launched in Sweden. The material is available via a website, PrivateClassics.com.[8]

The median nerve is a nerve in humans and other animals in the upper limb. It is one of the five main nerves originating from the brachial plexus.
The median nerve originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, and has contributions from ventral roots of C5-C7(lateral cord) and C8 & T1 (medial cord).
The median nerve is the only nerve that passes through the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the disability that results from the median nerve being pressed in the carpal tunnel.

Structure[edit]
After receiving inputs from both the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, the median nerve enters the arm from the axilla at the inferior margin of the teres major muscle. It then passes vertically down and courses with the brachial artery on the medial side of the arm between biceps brachii and brachialis. At first it is lateral to the artery and lies anterior to the elbow joint; it then crosses anteriorly to run medial to the artery in the distal arm and into the cubital fossa.
Inside the cubital fossa the median nerve passes medial to the brachial artery, in front of the point of insertion of the brachialis muscle and deep to the biceps.
The median nerve gives off an articular branch in the upper arm as it passes the elbow joint. A branch to pronator teres may arise from the median nerve immediately proximal to the elbow joint.
Forearm[edit]
The median nerve arises from the cubital fossa and passes between the two heads of pronator teres. It then travels between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus before emerging between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor pollicis longus.
The unbranched portion of the median nerve (which arises from the cubital fossa) innervates muscles of superficial and intermediate groups of the anterior(flexor) compartment except flexor carpi ulnaris.
The median nerve does give off two branches as it courses through the forearm:

The anterior interosseous branch courses with the anterior interosseous artery and innervates all the muscles of the deep group of the anterior compartment of the forearm except the medial (ulnar half, which is supplied by ulnar nerve) half of flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. It ends with its innervation of pronator quadratus.
The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve arises at the distal part of the forearm. It supplies sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the skin of the palm (but not the digits).

Hand[edit]
The median nerve enters the hand through the carpal tunnel, deep to the flexor retinaculum along with the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor pollicis longus.
From there it sends off several branches:

1. Recurrent branch to muscles of the thenar compartment (the recurrent branch is also called "the million dollar nerve").[1] Here it provides motor innervation to opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis and superficial part of flexor pollicis brevis.
2. Digital cutaneous branches to common palmar digital branch and proper palmar digital branch of the median nerve which supply the:

a) lateral (radial) three and a half digits on the palmar side
b) dorsum of the tips of index, middle and thumb


3. The median nerve supplies motor innervation to the first and second lumbricals of the hand.

Variation[edit]
There are multiple naturally occurring anomalies of the median nerve.

Bifurcation of the median nerve typically occurs after the nerve exits the carpal tunnel; however, in a small percentage (5%-10%) of individuals, the median nerve bifurcates more proximal in the carpal tunnel, wrist, or forearm.[2]
During gestation, a median artery that serves the hand retracts. However, in some individuals the median artery does not retract and follows the course next to the median nerve into the hand.
Martin-Gruber anastomoses can occur when branches of the median nerve cross-over in the forearm and merge with the ulnar nerve to innervate portions of the forehand.
Riche-Cannieu anastomoses can occur when there is connection between recurrent branch of the median nerve and deep branch of the ulnar nerve of the hand.

Function[edit]
Arm[edit]
The median nerve has no voluntary motor or cutaneous function in the brachium. It gives vascular branches to the wall of the brachial artery. These vascular branches carry sympathetic fibers.
Forearm[edit]
It innervates all of the flexors in the forearm except flexor carpi ulnaris and that part of flexor digitorum profundus that supplies the 2nd and 3rd digits. The latter two muscles are supplied by the ulnar nerve (specifically the muscular branches of ulnar nerve).
The main portion of the median nerve supplies the following muscles:
Superficial group:

Pronator teres
Flexor carpi radialis
Palmaris longus

Intermediate group:

Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle

The anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve supplies the following muscles:
Deep group:

Flexor digitorum profundus (only the lateral half)
Flexor pollicis longus
Pronator quadratus

Hand[edit]




The cutaneous innervation of the right hand. Areas supplied by the median nerve are colored green, the radial nerve red and the ulnar nerve blue. It appears that the borderline has been mistakenly drawn through the middle finger, rather than through the ring finger on the dorsal side of the hand!


In the hand, the median nerve supplies motor innervation to the 1st and 2nd lumbrical muscles. It also supplies the muscles of the thenar eminence by a recurrent thenar branch. The rest of the intrinsic muscles of the hand are supplied by the ulnar nerve.
The median nerve innervates the skin of the palmar side of the index, the thumb and middle finger, half the ring finger, and the nail bed. The lateral part of the palm is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which leaves the nerve proximal to the wrist creases. This palmar cutaneous branch travels in a separate fascial groove adjacent to the flexor carpi radialis and then superficial to the flexor retinaculum. It is therefore spared in carpal tunnel syndrome.
The muscles of the hand supplied by the median nerve can be remembered using the mnemonic, "LOAF" for Lumbricals 1 & 2, Opponens pollicis, Abductor pollicis brevis and Flexor pollicis brevis. (NB: OAF are the thenar eminence).[3]
Clinical significance[edit]
Injury[edit]
Injury of median nerve at different levels causes different syndromes with varying motor and sensory deficits.
Above the elbow

Common mechanism of injury: A supracondylar humerus fracture
Motor deficit:

Loss of pronation of forearm, weakness in flexion of the hand at the wrist, loss of flexion of radial half of digits and thumb, loss of abduction and opposition of thumb.
Presence of an ape hand deformity when the hand is at rest, due to an hyperextension of index finger and thumb, and an adducted thumb.
Presence of benediction sign when attempting to form a fist, due to loss of flexion of radial half of digits.


Sensory deficit: Loss of sensation in lateral  3 1⁄2 digits including their nail beds, and the thenar area.

At the elbow

Entrapment at the level of the elbow or the proximal forearm could be due to the pronator teres syndrome.

Within the proximal forearm: Anterior interosseous syndrome

Injury to the anterior interosseous branch in the forearm causes the anterior interosseous syndrome.
Common mechanisms: Tight cast, forearm bone fracture
Motor deficit: Loss of pronation of forearm, loss of flexion of radial half of digits and thumb.
Sensory deficit: None

At the wrist

Common mechanism: Wrist laceration
Motor deficit:

Weakness in flexion of radial half of digits and thumb, loss of abduction and opposition of thumb.
Presence of an ape hand deformity when the hand is at rest may be likely, due to an hyperextension of index finger and thumb, and an adducted thumb. Nevertheless, an ape hand deformity is not a requirement for a carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis.
Presence of benediction sign when attempting to form a fist, due to weakness in flexion of radial half of digits.


Sensory deficit: Loss of sensation in lateral  3 1⁄2 digits including their nail beds, and the thenar area.

Within the wrist: Carpal tunnel syndrome

Common mechanism: Carpal tunnel syndrome, an injury by compression in the carpal tunnel, without transection of the median nerve, due to overuse by activities such as keyboard typing and cooking.
Motor deficit:

Weakness in flexion of radial half of digits and thumb, weakness in abduction and opposition of thumb.
Presence of an ape hand deformity or when attempting to form a fist, the benediction sign, due to compression of the median nerve, as opposed to complete median nerve palsy.


Sensory deficit: Numbness and tingling in lateral  3 1⁄2 digits including their nail beds but excluding the thenar eminence which is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve .[4] Unlike in wrist laceration, there is still sensation in the area of the central palm. Sensation is not lost because the palmar cutaneous branch runs above the flexor retinaculum, and is not affected in compression in carpal tunnel syndrome.[1]

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group.
Median income can be calculated by household income, by personal income, or for specific demographic groups.

Gallup gross median household income[edit]
In 2013, Gallup published a list of countries with median household income, based on a self-reported survey of approximately 1000 adults from each country.[1] Using median, rather than mean income, results in a much more accurate picture of the typical income of the middle class since the data will not be skewed by gains and abnormalities in the extreme ends. The figures are in international dollars using purchasing power parity and are based on responses from at least 2,000 adults in each country, with the data aggregated from 2006 to 2012. Below is a list of the top 30 countries. The figures do not take taxes and social contributions into account.[1]

* The US Census reports that median household money income during the 2006-2012 period averaged $49,830, therefore by comparison, the Gallup result is underreported compared to Census' own figures.[2] (table H6). A study on the Census income data claims that when correcting for underreporting, U.S. gross median household income was $57,739 in 2010 (table 3).[3]
Median equivalent adult income[edit]
The annual median equivalence disposable household income for selected OECD countries is shown in the table below. This is the disposable income of an equivalent adult in a household in the middle of the income distribution in a year.
Data are in United States dollars at current prices and current purchasing power parity for private consumption for the reference year.

An academic study on the Census income data claims that when correcting for underreporting, U.S. gross median household income was 15% higher in 2010 (table 3).[3] The OECD uses the Census ASEC as its source for the US [5]

Median household income and the US economy[edit]




This graph shows the income since 1970 of different racial and ethnic groups in the United States (in 2014 dollars).[6]


Since 1980, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has increased 67%,[7] while median household income has only increased by 15%. Median household income is a politically sensitive indicator. Voters can be critical of their government if they perceive that their cost of living is rising faster than their income.
The early-2000s recession began with the bursting of the dot-com bubble and affected most advanced economies including the European Union, Japan and the United States. An economic recession will normally cause household incomes to decrease, often by as much as 10%.
The late-2000s recession began with the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble, which caused a problem in the dangerously exposed sub prime-mortgage market. This in turn triggered a global financial crisis. In constant price, 2011 American median household income was 1.13% lower than what it was in 1989. This corresponds to a 0.05% annual decrease over a 22-year period.[8] In the mean time, GDP per capita has increased by 33.8% or 1.33% annually.[9]

In 2015, the US median household income spiked 5.2 percent, reaching $56,000, making it the first annual hike in median household income since the start of the Great Recession.[10]
