History[edit]
Bezeq was founded in 1984 as a government-owned corporation, taking over the provision of telephony services in Israel, which were previously run directly by the Ministry of Communications. The drive for creating the company was the highly bureaucratic and inefficient nature of the government ran service, requiring customers to wait several years until they got a phone line installed.
In the late 1980s Anat Hoffman founded a group, Bezeq-Afflicted Clients Association, to protect the interests of Bezeq customers. A major complaint was that Bezeq refused to offer customers itemized bills, so they had no assurance they were paying for services they actually received. National hearings were held where customers had the opportunity to share their grievances against Bezeq. Hoffman notes that of 46 cases handled through small claims court, the consumers prevailed against Bezeq in 43. Within two years of the well publicized campaign for itemized bills, they were finally offered to consumers.[2]
In 1994, Bezeq acquired 50% ownership of Pelephone, Israel's first mobile communication company, in 2004 acquired full ownership of the company from its co-owner Motorola.
In 1998, Bezeq co-founded Yes, a direct-broadcast satellite provider, which began broadcasting in July 2000.
In January 2012, Bezeq International Optical System was completed, a submarine telecommunication cable linking Tel Aviv and Bari in Italy. The system spans 2,300 km of cable, and extended terrestrially from Bari through Interoute's network to major European cities.[3]
In April 2012, Bezeq acquired full ownership of Walla! Communications, Israel's leading Internet portal, which has more than 2.5 Million monthly unique users. Bezeq operates the B144 directory enquiries and yellow pages brand.
In February 2015, Bezeq acquired full ownership of Yes, Israel's leading television provider, for ₪680 million.
Loss of monopoly status[edit]
In 1994, Cellcom a new Mobile communication company was founded, breaking Pelephone's monopoly in this area. In 1999, a third competitor, Partner Communications Company, was established.
In 1997, two new competitors were introduced in international calling services (Barak and Golden Lines), and Bezeq was obliged to establish a new subsidiarity to compete with them named Bezeq International.
Until the mid-first decade of the 21st century when it was owned by the Israeli government, Bezeq had a monopoly on landline telephony and Internet access infrastructure (ADSL VDSL2).[4] Though still the most dominant provider of telephone services,[5] it has had competition from the sole cable provider in the country (since September 2006), Hot, which offers a cables based telephone and internet access services as of 2005, and with 012 Smile and more recently 013 netvision and Orange.
Privatization[edit]
On May 9, 2005, Israel's Government Companies Authority, headed by Eyal Gabbai privatized Bezeq when 30% of its shares were sold by the state to the Apax-Saban-Arkin investment group for $972 million.[6]
The cellular communications provider Pelephone is a fully owned subsidiary of Bezeq. Bezeq is also the largest shareholder in D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd., known by its trademark name, Yes, the DBS television provider in Israel.
In April 2010, the controlling interest in Bezeq, held by the Apax-Saban-Arkin group, was sold to B Communications, a subsidiary of Shaul Elovitch's Eurocom Group, for $1.75 billion.[7]

Conversely, a stock with a beta lower than 1 is expected to rise less than the market when the market is moving up , but fall less than the market when the market is moving down. Despite being rare, a stock may have a negative beta, which means the stock moves opposite the general market trend.Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd. shows a Beta of -8.03.This is significantly lower than 1. The volatility of Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp.

More...Did you know ?Infinancials' Beta calculator allows you to define your input parameters for custom beta calculations.The beta calculator offers additional flexibility, such as:- Reference index: apply the same reference index for all companies in your list regardless of their country.- Sampling frequency: choose between a weekly or a monthly sampling frequency for the closing prices.- Debt for unlevered beta: choose the type of debt to be used for unlevered beta calculations.- Additional beta statistics: calculate R-squared and T-value.About BetaStandard beta is co-called levered, which means that it reflects the capital structure of the company (including the financial risk linked to the debt level). Unlevered beta (or ungeared beta) compares the risk of an unlevered company (i.e. with no debt in the capital structure) to the risk of the market. Unlevered beta is useful when comparing companies with different capital structures as it focuses on the equity risk. Unlevered beta is generally lower than the levered beta. However, unlevered beta could be higher than levered beta when the net debt is negative (meaning that the company has more cash than debt).Many different betas can be calculated for a given stock. The main common variables that affect beta calculations are the time period, the reference date, the sampling frequency for closing prices and the reference index.The calculation divides the covariance of the stock return with the market return by the variance of the market return. Beta is used very often for company valuation using the Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) method. The discount rate is calculated using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC is essentially a blend of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt. The cost of equity is usually calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which defines the cost of equity as follows: re = rf + β × (rm - rf)Where:rf = Risk-free rateβ = Beta (levered)(rm - rf) = Market risk premium.Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp.

Ratios valuation of Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd. ( BEZQ | ISR)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is very commonly used for business valuation as it indicates whether a company may be undervalued or overvalued compared to industry peers. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value. (Enterprise Value vs. Market Capitalization)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd. is higher than the median of its peer group: around 5.00. According to these financial ratios Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd.'s valuation is above the market valuation of its peer group.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd. is lower than the average of its sector (Fixed Line Telecommunications): 6.91. According to these financial ratios Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd.'s valuation is below the market valuation of its sector.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd. is slightly lower than its historical 5-year average: 6.1.

Just click the market multiple or financial ratio figure to open the formula viewer.It is possible to further drill down through the calculation chain clicking underlined figures.About Financials RatiosFinancial ratios are generally ratios of selected values on an enterprise's financial statements. There are many standard financial ratios used in order to evaluate a business or a company. Financial ratios can also be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Security analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses of various companies. In Infinancials, financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business that the ratio measures:- Growth ratios measure the company's rate of growth and assess the potential for future growth. E.g. Net Sales Growth, EBITDA Growth, EBIT Growth.- Profitability ratios measure the returns generated on sales and investment, hence the ability of the company to generate profits.Profitability ratios include margin ratios (such as profit margin or operating margin) and return ratios (such as return on equity or return on assets).- Capital structure and liquidity ratios measure the extent to which the company is relying upon debt to fund its operations, and its ability to pay back the debt. Capital structure ratios include debt to equity and debt to asset ratios, and liquidity ratios include coverage ratios and solvency ratios.- Asset utilization ratios, also called activity or efficiency ratios, measure how efficiently the company's day to day operations are managing inventory, selling and producing products, or using assets to generate revenue.Financial ratios allow for comparisons between companies, between industries and also between a single company and its industry average or peer group average.

      Immediate Report
    

      Hearing on Supervisory Mechanism for Company's Rates
    

      On June 27, 2017 the Company received a hearing letter concerning the supervisory mechanism for Company rates, sent by the Director General of the Ministry of Communications, as part of the implementation of the Ministry of Communications' policy as stated in a policy document of the Minister of Communications dated May 2, 2012 concerning the expansion of competition in the fixed line sector - wholesale market ("the Hearing").
    


          According to the Hearing documents two alternatives are being considered by the Ministry for the supervisory mechanism for existing rates for telephony over regular telephone lines supplied to the private and small businesses sector ("Regular Lines"), of which the main points follow:
        



          Alternative 1:
        

          To convert the existing supervisory method that sets fixed rates to maximum rates. Setting the level of maximum rates for the main telephony services (telephone line - NIS 57.92 including VAT, and 1.87 agorot including VAT for calls) would be done in relation to the updated costs structure based on the report of the international consulting firm Frontier Economics. In most additional services the existing rate will become the maximum rate and supervision of rates will be removed from some in accordance with demand levels for the service and the various alternatives on the market.
        



          Alternative 2:
        

          To remove supervision on rates from the main telephony services - line and telephone calls, and from additional services that today are supervised as part of the fixed rates. In this alternative it is proposed setting, in accordance with section 15(A) of the Communications Law (Bezeq and Broadcasts), 1982, a maximum price for a "supervised package" that would be offered by the Company to subscribers interested in that service, in order to mitigate the concern about price rises due to lack of supervision. The "Supervised Package" would include a telephone line and call minutes and would be similar to the package of payments most in demand offered by the Company today, and accordingly will be suitable for most subscribers. The price of the
        

          Supervised Package will be NIS 49.90 per month (including VAT) and will include up to 300 minutes of calls per month to all domestic numbers, including both fixed line and mobile, and a payment of 18 agorot (including VAT) for each additional minute. Similarly, in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of the Communications Law, the Company will be entitled to collect a reasonable price for services for which a payment has not been set in the regulations.
        



          Similarly, it is proposed that existing subscribers of the alternative payments package for the "Kav Kal" (Light Line) service can, if they so wish, continue to receive the terms of that package whereas new subscribers would not be able to join it.
        



          In addition, according to the Hearing documents, the Ministry of Communications is considering setting a single alternative for the supervisory mechanism for telephony rates on PRI channels supplied to the medium and large businesses sector and cancelling supervision of rates on the calls.
        



          The Company is studying the Hearing documents and estimates it will submit its responses by July 30, 2017 as requested. The Company is unable at this point to estimate the impact on the Company of the change in the supervisory mechanism being considered in the Hearing, if such change will be implemented.
