Global Telecom  HOLDING ANNOUNCES Proposed SHARE BUY-BACK AND Cancellation of GDR PROGRAM 
 
Amsterdam (16 January 2017) - Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. ("GTH" or the "Company") (EGX: GTHE.CA, LSE: GLTD:LI), an Egyptian joint stock company, today announces that it proposes: (i) to launch a fixed price buy-back program to acquire up to 10.00% of the total issued share capital of the Company (the "Share Buy-Back") at a price per share of EGP (Egyptian pounds) 7.90 and for a total consideration of up to EGP 4.1 billion; and (2) to carry out the Cancellation (as defined below).
SHARE BUY-BACK
GTH is launching the Share Buy-Back primarily: (1) to maximise shareholder value; (2) to reduce the Company's share capital; and (3) as a supportive action to the cancellation of its GDR Listing (as defined below) as it may give holders of global depositary receipts in the Company ("GDRs" and holders of GDRs, "GDR Holders") an opportunity to dispose of all or some of their GDRs prior to the cancellation of the listing of GDRs on the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and the cancellation of trading of the GDRs on the Main Market for Listed Securities of the London Stock Exchange plc (the "GDR Listing").
The Share Buy-Back is expected to commence on 19 January 2017 (the "Launch Date") and, subject to the approval of the Egyptian Stock Exchange ("EGX") and the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority ("EFSA"), is expected to expire at 2.30 p.m., Cairo time, on 16 February 2017 (the "Expiration Date").  Subject to the timing of the receipt of the EGX's approval, the Launch Date and the Expiration Date may be earlier or later than (as the case may be) as stated in this announcement.  A further announcement will be released by the Company on the commencement of the Share Buy-Back, confirming the Launch Date and Expiration Date.   Buy-Back Shares (as defined below) must be validly offered for sale prior to the Expiration Date.   Buy-Back Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the Share Buy-Back will be held in treasury until a reduction of capital is approved by an extraordinary general assembly meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the "Shareholders"), which is expected to occur on or around 9 March 2017.
In accordance with Egyptian law, if the aggregate number of ordinary shares of the Company offered for sale in the Share Buy-Back (the "Buy-Back Shares") exceeds 524,569,062 (representing 10.00% of the total issued share capital of the Company), the number of Buy-Back Shares which will be accepted from each Shareholder who offered Buy-Back Shares into the Share Buy-Back will be scaled down pro-rata in relation to the total number of Buy-Back Shares so offered for sale, such that the total number of Buy-Back Shares purchased pursuant to the Share Buy-Back will not exceed 10.00% of the total issued share capital of the Company.  
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Buy-Back, the Company, or a person acting on its behalf, expects to make payment (after the deduction of any taxes, fees and expenses) to the relevant local Egyptian broker in respect of the accepted Buy-Back Shares in cash, without interest, within approximately three Egyptian business days of the Expiration Date. 
The Share Buy-Back is subject to the terms and conditions included in the Share Buy-Back application, which the Company has submitted to the EGX in the form appended to this announcement as Appendix 2 (the "EGX Share Buy-Back Application").
The Share Buy-Back will be financed using available cash and either existing or new credit facilities.  GTH expects to enter into an unsecured short-term loan agreement with one or more international and/or local financial institutions for up to U.S.$200 million (the "Loan Agreement").  The Loan Agreement is expected to have a tenor of less than one year.
GDR Holders may not sell their GDRs directly in the Share Buy-Back. However, GDR Holders may participate in the Share Buy-Back by withdrawing the ordinary shares underlying their GDRs from the Depositary (as defined in Appendix 1 (Instructions to GDR Holders)) and then offering for sale such ordinary shares in the Share Buy-Back.  For further details, GDR Holders should refer to Appendix 1 (Instructions to GDR Holders) below. Each GDR represents five ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.
Although the Board of Directors believes that the return of cash by means of the Share Buy-Back is in the best interests of the Shareholders as a whole and has approved the Share Buy-Back, neither the Board of Directors nor the Company is making a recommendation to Shareholders in relation to participation in the Share Buy-Back itself. Whether or not Shareholders decide to offer all or any of their Shares (as defined below) (including Shares represented by GDRs ("GDR Shares")) for sale will depend, among other things, on their view of the Company's prospects and their own individual circumstances, including their tax position.  Shareholders should make their own decision in respect of participation in the Share Buy-Back and are recommended to consult their duly authorised independent advisors.
CANCELLATION OF THE GDR PROGRAM
The Board of Directors of the Company believes that the cancellation of the GDR program through the cancellation of the GDR Listing and the termination of the Deposit Agreements (as defined below) (the "Cancellation") is in the best interests of the Company.  The low volume of trading of the GDRs on the London Stock Exchange does not offer investors the opportunity to trade in meaningful volumes or with any frequency within the public markets.  For the twelve months ending 31 December 2016, the average daily trading volume in GDRs was 568,260, representing an average value of U.S.$963,200 per day.  Additionally, the regulatory and administrative burden on the Company, including associated costs, will be reduced as a result of the cancellation of the GDR Listing as the Company will no longer have a dual-listing on the London Stock Exchange and the EGX.  
Given the low trading volume of the GDRs on the London Stock Exchange, the regulatory and administrative burden on the Company in maintaining the GDR Listing and associated costs, the Company considers it: (1) more cost-effective to cancel the GDR Listing; and (2) beneficial to Shareholders.  The issued ordinary shares of the Company (the "Shares") will remain listed on the EGX.  In the event of Cancellation, no material impact is expected on the Company's performance.
The Cancellation is subject to the approval of an extraordinary general assembly meeting of the GDR Holders represented by the Depositary (as the holder of the GDR Shares) and an extraordinary general assembly meeting of the Shareholders (including the Depositary as the holder of the GDR Shares) (together, the "EGMs").  Notice of the EGMs will be circulated to all eligible GDR Holders and Shareholders of the Company in due course (as applicable).  Subject to GDR Holder and Shareholder approval, the cancellation of the GDR Listing is currently expected to occur on or around 8 March 2017.  The precise date of the cancellation of the GDR Listing will be announced in due course.
Cancellation of the GDR Listing will significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability, and potentially reduce the market value, of the remaining GDRs. 
In connection with the proposed Cancellation, the Company intends to simultaneously amend and terminate the deposit agreements, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Deposit Agreements"), entered into in connection with the GDR program.  Any such termination will be conditional upon Shareholder approval of the Cancellation.  The amendments to the Deposit Agreements will enable the Depositary to offer for sale the Shares immediately post-termination and also enable the Depositary to offer for sale the Shares remaining post-termination in any offer that is then open and available.  Such amendments do not require the approval of GDR Holders.  Under the terms of the Deposit Agreements, GDR Holders will receive not less than 90 days' notice of such amendment and termination. 
Following the termination of the Deposit Agreements, if a GDR Holder has not surrendered its GDRs and requested delivery to it of the Shares underlying its GDRs, such Shares may be sold on behalf of such GDR Holder by the Depositary and the net proceeds of such sale returned to such GDR Holder upon surrender of its GDRs and the deduction of a cancellation fee at a preferential rate of U.S.$0.03 (as opposed to the ordinarily payable cancellation fee of up to U.S.$0.05) per GDR, in addition to the deduction of a cable fee of U.S.$17.50 and any applicable taxes or governmental charges which are payable (the "Depositary's Fees").  If a GDR Holder surrenders its GDRs prior to termination of the Deposit Agreements and requests delivery of the Shares underlying its GDRs, the relevant GDRs will be cancelled and the Depositary's Fees will be incurred by such GDR Holder.  If the Cancellation is not approved at the EGMs and the Deposit Agreements are not terminated, the GDR Holders will continue to pay fees to the Depositary under the Deposit Agreements.

APPENDIX 1
instructions to GDR Holders 
The Share Buy-Back is expected to commence on 19 January 2017 (the "Launch Date") and, subject to the approval of the EGX and the EFSA, is expected to expire at 2.30 p.m., Cairo time, on 16 February 2017 (the "Expiration Date").  Subject to the timing of the receipt of the EGX's approval, the Launch Date and the Expiration Date may be earlier or later than (as the case may be) as stated in this announcement.  A further announcement will be released by the Company on the commencement of the Share Buy-Back, confirming the Launch Date and Expiration Date.   Buy-Back Shares must be validly offered prior to the Expiration Date and may be validly withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date.  Buy-Back Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the Share Buy-Back will be held in treasury until a reduction of capital is approved by an extraordinary general assembly meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, which is expected to occur on or around 9 March 2017.  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR GDR HOLDERS
GDR Holders may not sell their GDRs directly in the Share Buy-Back.  However, GDR Holders may participate in the Share Buy-Back by withdrawing the Shares underlying their GDRs from the Bank of New York Mellon (the "Depositary") and then offering for sale those Shares in the Share Buy-Back.  The relevant procedures applicable to GDR Holders to participate in the Share Buy-Back are set out below:
1.            Each GDR Holder must instruct its broker or other securities intermediary through which it holds GDRs to:
(a)           surrender the GDRs to the Depositary by book-entry transfer to the Depositary's Depository Trust Company account;
(b)           pay the Depositary's Fees;
(c)           sign and deliver the appropriate withdrawal certification form (which for holders of Rule 144A GDRs is available at: https://www.adrbnymellon.com/files/qb6062.pdf and for holders of Regulation S GDRs is available at https://www.adrbnymellon.com/files/qb6063.pdf); and
(d)           provide the Depositary with details of a custodial account in Egypt into which the withdrawn Shares can be delivered (a "Local Custodian").
2.            If you do not have a Local Custodian, you may contact Pharos Securities Brokerage S.A.E. ("Pharos") who may provide GDR Holders with such local custodial services.  Such services will be provided by Pharos to GDR Holders at a preferential fee rate. See paragraph 7 below for further information. The contact details of Pharos are set out at the end of this Appendix 1.
3.            Alternatively, GDR Holders may make arrangements with another Local Custodian of their choice.
4.            Once the Shares have been withdrawn in accordance with paragraph 1 above and delivered to the Local Custodian, GDR Holders must instruct a broker which is authorised to act as a broker in Egypt (the "Local Broker") to offer for sale their Buy-Back Shares in the Share Buy-Back.  The Local Custodian may, to the extent it has a brokerage arm, also act as the Local Broker.
5.            If you do not have a Local Broker you may contact Pharos who may provide GDR Holders with such local brokerage services.  Such services will be provided by Pharos to GDR Holders at a preferential fee rate. See paragraph 7 below for further information. The contact details of Pharos are set out at the end of this Appendix 1.
6.            Alternatively, GDR Holders may make arrangements with another Local Broker of their choice.
7.            In the event a GDR Holder wishes to appoint Pharos to provide a custodial and/or brokerage service, certain "know your client" information and documentation will need to be provided to Pharos and, in the event a brokerage account is to be opened, an account opening agreement will need to be entered into.  Further details on the "know your client" information requirements and account opening agreement is available at http://www.pharosholding.com/en/new-client/ and will be provided on request by contacting Pharos using the contact details set out at the end of this Appendix 1.
8.            In addition to the Depositary's Fees, GDR Holders will be required to pay custodian and brokerage fees as well as fees to third parties including the EGX, Clearstream Banking S.A. and Misr for Central Clearing, Depositary and Registry S.A.E..
9.            If, after withdrawing Shares from the Depositary, GDR Holders wish to return any Shares to the Depositary prior to the termination of the Deposit Agreements, for example if the Company has not purchased all the Buy-Back Shares offered for sale, then additional fees will be payable.  GDR Holders should note that, even if the Company does not obtain the required approvals at the EGMs to cancel the GDR Listing, GDR Holders who have withdrawn their Shares from the Depositary will be prohibited, pursuant to Egyptian law and regulations, from depositing some or all of their Shares back into the GDR program with the Depositary in exchange for GDRs.  
GDR Holders should allow time for the procedures above, including any "know your client" process, to be completed prior to the Expiration Date.  In addition, individual brokers may require that instructions to participate in the Share Buy-Back are received well in advance of the Expiration Date.  Failure to complete these procedures or provide the required instructions in a timely manner may prejudice GDR Holders' ability to participate in the Share Buy-Back.
Offers of Buy-Back Shares may be withdrawn until the Expiration Date.  A Shareholder who has offered Buy-Back Shares will have its Buy-Back Shares blocked and therefore will not be able to transfer, dispose of, or otherwise deal in those Buy-Back Shares unless the Shareholder validly withdraws its offer of Buy-Back Shares.  For a withdrawal to be effective, your Local Broker must receive a written notice of withdrawal no later than 2.29 p.m., Cairo time, on the Expiration Date.  Any notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the relevant Shareholder and the number of Buy-Back Shares to be withdrawn.  All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by the Company in its sole discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE SHARE BUY-BACK
If you do not wish to offer for sale your Shares or the Shares represented by your GDRs, you need not take any action.  None of the Company, its directors, officers or employees, the advisors to the Company or the Depositary make any recommendation to any GDR Holder or Shareholder as to whether to offer or refrain from offering for sale the Shares represented by its GDRs or its Shares, respectively.  No person has been authorised to make any recommendation on behalf of the Company or the advisors to the Company as to whether GDR Holders or Shareholders should offer or refrain from offering for sale the Shares represented by their GDRs or their Shares, respectively, pursuant to the Share Buy-Back or to make any representation or to give any information in connection with the Share Buy-Back, other than as contained herein.  If made or given, any such recommendation, representation or information must not be relied upon as having been authorised by the Company, its directors, officers or employees, or the advisors to the Company.  GDR Holders and Shareholders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the announcement, the Instructions and the EGX Share Buy-Back Application and other related materials, consult their own investment and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to offer or refrain from offering the Shares represented by their GDRs or their Shares, respectively.  In particular, no advice is given with respect to the tax position of the GDR Holders or Shareholders or any person on whose behalf the GDR Holders or Shareholders hold as custodian, nominee or trustee.
None of the delivery of the announcement, the Instructions or the EGX Share Buy-Back Application nor any purchase of Shares or the Shares represented by GDRs under the Share Buy-Back shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Company since the date hereof, or that the information herein is correct as of any time subsequent to the date hereof.
Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") nor any securities commission of any State of the United States or regulatory authority in the United States has approved or disapproved of the announcement, the Instructions or the EGX Share Buy-Back Application, expressed a view with respect to the fairness or merits of the Share Buy-Back or determined whether the announcement, the Instructions or the EGX Share Buy-Back Application are accurate or complete.  Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.
NOTICE TO OVERSEAS SHAREHOLDERS
The Share Buy-Back does not constitute an offer or a solicitation to any person in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful.  The Share Buy-Back is not being made available to Shareholders in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance of the Share Buy-Back would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. Any Shareholders with a registered address in such jurisdiction will be excluded from the Share Buy-Back.  However, the Company may, in its sole discretion, take such action as it may deem necessary to comply with the laws of any such jurisdiction so that the Share Buy-Back may be extended to, and acceptances may be received from, Shareholders in any such jurisdiction.
The Share Buy-Back is not being made available, directly or indirectly, in, into or from a jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Share Buy-Back is not capable of acceptance from or within that jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Africa) (each a "Restricted Jurisdiction"). Accordingly, copies of the announcement, these Instructions, the EGX Share Buy-Back Application and any accompanying document are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from a Restricted Jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction.  Any persons receiving the announcement, these Instructions, the EGX Share Buy-Back Application and any accompanying document (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise distribute or send them in, into or from such jurisdictions as doing so may invalidate any purported acceptance of the Share Buy-Back. The availability of the Share Buy-Back to overseas Shareholders may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are resident.  Such persons should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements of their jurisdictions.
NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
The announcement is only being distributed to, and is only directed at, persons who are located or resident outside the United Kingdom, or, in the case of persons located or resident inside the United Kingdom, who are: (i) investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the "Order") or (ii) high net worth entities, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated, falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (each such person being referred to as a "relevant person"). The announcement and its contents should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by recipients to any other persons in the United Kingdom.  The Share Buy-Back is only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to sell will be engaged in only with, relevant persons.  Any person in the United Kingdom who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on the announcement, the Instructions or the EGX Share Buy-Back Application, or any of their contents.
notice to SHAREHOLDERS in the united states
The Share Buy-Back is being made available in relation to the securities of a company organised under Egyptian law.  The securities of the Company have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are not listed or traded on any stock exchange in the United States, and the Company is not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and is not required to, and does not, file any reports thereunder with the SEC. The Share Buy-Back is being made available in the United States pursuant to applicable U.S. tender offer rules and securities laws, including the applicable provisions of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, subject to the exemptions provided by Rule 14d-1(d) under the Exchange Act, and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of Egyptian law. Accordingly, the Share Buy-Back is subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments, that are different from those applicable under United States domestic tender offer procedures and law. 
Shareholders in the United States should be aware that the announcement, the Instructions and the EGX Share Buy-Back Application and any other documents relating to the Share Buy-Back, have been or will be prepared in accordance with the Egyptian law disclosure requirements, format and style, all of which may differ from those in the United States. The Share Buy-Back is being made available in the United States by the Company and no one else.
It may be difficult for the Shareholders to enforce their rights and any claim they may have arising under the federal securities laws of the United States.  The Company is organised under the laws of Egypt.  Some or all of the officers and directors of the Company are residents of countries other than the United States.  In addition, most of the assets of the Company are located outside the United States.  The Shareholders may not be able to sue a foreign company or its officers or directors in a foreign court for violations of the U.S. securities laws, and it may be difficult to enforce the decisions of a U.S. court against a foreign company and its affiliates.
Shareholders who are U.S. persons should also be aware that participating in the Share Buy-Back may have tax consequences in the United States and that such consequences, if any, are not described herein.  Shareholders who are U.S. persons are urged to consult with legal, tax and financial advisors in connection with making a decision regarding the Share Buy-Back.

1. MAIN EVENTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
MAIN EVENTS
In February 2017, GTH announced that it has received a court ruling concerning Iraqna litigation. On 19 November 2012 Atheer Telecom Iraq Limited ("Atheer") initiated English High Court proceedings against Orascom Telecom Iraq Ltd. ("OTIL") and GTH in relation to a dispute arising from the 2007 sale of Iraqna, OTIL's Iraqi mobile subsidiary, to Atheer. Pursuant to the underlying share purchase agreement, Atheer was seeking declarations that OTIL and GTH are liable to indemnify it for certain tax liabilities. Atheer's initial claim was for USD 280 million, but later reduced to USD 60 million. On 17 February 2017, the Court found OTIL and GTH liable to indemnify Atheer. The precise financial terms of the order, including costs and interest will be determined at a hearing on 1 March 2017. GTH intends to seek leave to appeal the final judgment, however, leave to appeal is discretionary and may not be granted.  
 
In February 2017, GTH announced the cancelation of GDR program and completion of share buy-back. The cancellation of the global depositary receipts ("GDRs") program as proposed by the Board of Directors of Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. ("GTH") was approved during the extraordinary general assembly meeting of the shareholders on 6 February 2017. As a result, the listing of the GDRs on the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and the trading of GDRs on the Main Market for Listed Securities of the London Stock Exchange (the "GDR Listing") will cease from or around 20 March 2017 and GTH will keep its single listing on the Egyptian Stock Exchange in Cairo. GTH also launched a fixed price buy-back program to acquire up to 10% of the total issued share capital of GTH at a price per share of EGP 7.90 and for a total consideration of up to EGP 4.1 billion (the "Share Buy-Back"). GTH launched the Share Buy-Back primarily to maximize shareholder value, to reduce GTH's share capital and as a supportive action to the cancellation of its GDR Listing mentioned above, to provide the holders of GDRs in GTH an opportunity to dispose of all or some of their GDRs prior to the cancellation of the GDR Listing. The offer period of the Share Buy-Back expired at 2.30 p.m. (EET) on 16 February 2017, with 1,328,092,079 ordinary shares in the issued share capital of GTH offered for sale and for which, in accordance with the terms of the Share Buy-Back, 524,569,062 shares, representing 10% of all issued ordinary shares, were accepted for sale by GTH on a pro-rata basis. The Deposit Agreements will be amended and immediately terminated on 17 April 2017. On 26 February 2017 GTH has called for an EGM, which will be held on 19 March 2017, to approve the reduction of capital. In addition, GTH announced that it has entered into a short-term loan agreement with CITI and ING bank for a principal amount of USD 200 million.
In January 2017, GTH announced that Matthieu Galvani has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Djezzy, their business in Algeria. 
 
In November 2016, GTH announced that it has completed  the previously announced sale of Telecel International Ltd to ZARNet (Private) Limited in Zimbabwe for a consideration of USD 40 million, approximately half of which has been paid in cash, with the balance in the form of a loan to the government. Telecel International owns 60% of Telecel Zimbabwe Ltd. ZARNet is wholly owned by the Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe through the Ministry of Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services.

Service revenue was USD 736 million in Q4 2016. Excluding Warid, service revenue would have been USD 664 million. Service revenue organically decreased 2.2% YoY as a result of the weak performance of Algeria, due to high churn and ARPU erosion, and Bangladesh, partially compensated for by double-digit growth in Pakistan. Mobile data revenue continued strong growth of 75% YoY.  GTH continues to see customer organic growth of 2 million on the back of Pakistan's strong performance. 
EBITDA was USD 235 million in Q4 2016, while excluding Warid it would have been USD 225 million, declining 22.2% YoY organically mainly due to the provision of USD 66 million in 4Q 2016 for the Iraqna litigation. 
Underlying EBITDA stood at USD 339 million in Q4 2016, and USD 329 million excluding Warid which was stable organically YoY due to strong performance in Pakistan being offset by a decline in Algeria and Bangladesh.
Profit for the period reported increased 61% to USD 35 million in Q4 2016 as a result of the gain from the sale of Zimbabwe of USD 21 million, a significant YoY decrease in impairments of equipment and a foreign exchange gain recorded in the period.
CAPEX decreased 5% YoY to USD 517 million in FY 2016 primarily as a result of the performance transformation, leading to a LTM capex excluding licenses to revenue ratio of 18%. The company will maintain its strategy of investing in high-speed data networks to capture mobile data growth, including the roll-out of 4G/LTE networks in Algeria and 3G networks in Algeria, Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
Net debt increased 5% YoY to reach USD 2.0 billion due to the consolidation of Warid, resulting in the net debt to underlying LTM EBITDA increase of 2% to 1.5x at the end of Q4 2016.
 


2. GTH'S OPERATIONS
 
2-1 MOBILINK & WARID, PAKISTAN
KEY INDICATORS
 
Year-on year organic change in the table above calculated based on Mobilink stand-alone numbers



In July 2016, GTH closed the transaction to merge Mobilink with Warid, strengthening its leading position in Pakistan, and as a result, Warid's financial results have been consolidated in GTH´s financial statements with effect from 1 July 2016. After filing the merger petition with the Islamabad High Court in early October 2016, the companies received merger approval on 15 December 2016.
Despite aggressive price competition in the market, the newly merged entity gained customer market share in Q4 2016 year-on-year, as Mobilink continued to show double digit growth of both its customer base and revenue.
Underlying EBITDA margin, excluding both restructuring costs related to the performance transformation programme and integration costs related to the Warid transaction, was 40.3% in Q4 2016, slightly lower year-on-year due to the consolidation of Warid during 2016. Capex increased to PKR 10.1 billion in Q4 2016 while the full year capex to revenue ratio decreased to 16.6% and full year operating cash flow margin was 26%. 
The company is focused on integrating its operations, which is delivering results ahead of schedule. The two companies have been providing, since October 2016, unified on-net offers to their customers. In November, 3G was offered to Warid customers in 30 cities while 4G was offered to Mobilink customers in 17 cities. Interconnect, site sharing activities and marketing synergies reached PKR 8.2 billion of run-rate of synergies in Q4 2016.
The two companies, Mobilink and Warid, were rebranded into "Jazz" in January 2017 and have unified their distribution channels and systems, simplifying the customer experience.
In November 2016, the company declared, for the first time after 11 years, a gross dividend of PKR 5 billion (approximately USD 50 million) to its shareholders.
MOBILINK STAND-ALONE PERFORMANCE IN Q4 2016
Mobilink's market position continued to improve in Q4 2016, demonstrating strong performance with double-digit YoY revenue and EBITDA growth.
In Q4 2016, Mobilink's service revenue increased by 15%, supported by all revenue streams. Mobilink continues to show strong voice and VAS revenue growth, primarily as a result of robust customer growth. Data revenue grew by 62% due to successful data monetization initiatives, including attractive bundle offers and the unification of the tariff portfolio, together with continued 3G network expansion.
Mobilink's customer base increased 14% YoY in Q4 2016 supported by the continued focus on price simplicity, distribution and offer transparency. The company sees data and voice monetization among its key priorities, underpinned by striving to be the best network in terms of both quality of service and coverage. 
Mobile Financial Services ("MFS") revenue continued to show robust growth at 34%, driven by the success of over-the-counter ("OTC") transactions and higher agent activity.



2-2 DJEZZY, ALGERIA
KEY INDICATORS
 
1) MoU has been adjusted in 2016 and restated for 2015 due to a change of components in the definition of traffic 





Although Djezzy's operations delivered strong margins during Q4 2016, the company continued to experience significant pressure on results. Revenue decreased at double-digit rates and Djezzy continued to face customer churn and ARPU erosion. The company expects this pressure to continue, as it will take time to stabilize its commercial proposition and its customer base. 
To accelerate the turnaround, on 26 January 2017 Matthieu Galvani was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Djezzy. Matthieu has a strong commercial background and a deep knowledge of Algeria, the industry and the region; Djezzy is expected to benefit significantly from his expertise as it continues with its transformation into a digital leader.
The regulatory environment has recently improved in Algeria, as Djezzy's Significant Market Player status was lifted in the Q3 2016, which removes the Algeria Regulatory Authority for Post and Telecommunications approval procedure and the on-net/off-net asymmetry test on new commercial offers. The mobile termination rate ("MTR") asymmetry for Djezzy is a topic still under discussion with the regulator. From a taxation perspective, starting from January 2017, the new finance law increased pressure through an increase of VAT from 7% to 19% on data and from 17% to 19% on voice, and taxes on recharges from 5% to 7%.
GTH's customer base in Algeria decreased 4% year-on-year to 16.3 million and ARPU declined by 10% due to the combined impact of historic 3G coverage shortfalls, sub-optimal changes in early 2016 to both billing increments and the commission structure for indirect distribution, which were partially corrected in Q2 2016, and forced migrations from legacy tariffs from late 2015 onwards. 

As a result, Djezzy's Q4 2016 service revenue was DZD 26.9 billion, a 14% reduction, while data revenue growth remained strong at 70%, due to the higher usage and substantial increase in data customers as a result of the 3G and 4G/LTE network roll-out. 
The company is taking structural measures to improve performance and stabilize its customer base, including distribution transformation and mono-brand roll-out, accelerating its 4G/LTE network deployment, promoting micro campaigns with tailored services to increase satisfaction, data monetization activities and smartphone promotions coupled with bundle offers. In late October 2016, Djezzy launched a simplified data centric pricing architecture, with new simple bundle offers within "Djezzy carte".
In Q4 2016, EBITDA decreased 20% to DZD 13.9 billion mainly due to the revenue decline. EBITDA margin remained strong at 50.9% due to commercial and network costs optimization as well as a decline in personnel costs, driven by headcount reduction. Underlying EBITDA decreased 24%, adjusted for exceptional costs of DZD 0.1 billion related to the performance transformation program in Q4 2016 while the underlying EBITDA margin was 51.6%.
The company, having launched 4G/LTE services in early October 2016, had covered 20 wilayas with this new technology by the end of 2016 and holds a distinct 4G/LTE coverage advantage.  In Q4 2016, Djezzy also continued to roll-out 3G in new regions and, as expected, completed the 3G network roll-out across all 48 of Algeria's wilayas.  In Q4 2016, capex was DZD 6.2 billion, a 16% decrease, while the full year capex to revenue ratio was 16.0% and full year operating cash flow margin was strong at 38.0%.



 
2-3 BANGLALINK, BANGLADESH
KEY INDICATORS
 







In Bangladesh, the operational focus during Q4 2016 was on network coverage, in order to address the 3G gap vis-à-vis the competition, and on customer acquisition following the completion of the Government-mandated SIM re-verification program, which had contributed to a slowdown of acquisition activity across the market in the earlier part of 2016. 
In Q4 2016, excluding the results of the re-verification process, which resulted in 3.8 million SIM cards being blocked by Banglalink, the customer base would have increased by 6% YoY. On a QoQ basis, the customer base grew by 1.4 million customers in Q4 2016. 
Total revenue in Q4 2016 was flat YoY while Banglalink's service revenue decreased 2% to BDT 11.6 billion.  The low single-digit decline in service revenue was partially caused by the imposition of an incremental 2% supplementary duty on recharges, effective from June 2016, the additional 1% surcharge introduced in March 2016, together with the gap in 3G network coverage versus the market leader.  In addition, there was a period of intense price competition, which accelerated following the SIM-reverification process and which more than offset the continued increase in data revenue of 44%. This data revenue growth was driven by data usage growth of 192% along with 7% growth in active data users which resulted in a 6.5% growth in Banglalink's ARPU in Q4 2016. 
In Q4 2016, the company's underlying EBITDA decreased by 11% to BDT 5.1 billion, mainly due to the accelerated customer acquisition activity during the quarter. As a result, in Q4 2016, the underlying EBITDA margin was 42.9%, which represents a reduction of 5.1 percentage points YoY.
In Q4 2016, Capex increased 56% YoY to BDT 5.1 billion in Q4 2016, reversing the trend of Q3 2016, while the full year capex to revenue ratio was 22.1% and the full year operating cash flow margin was 24.3%. 
Banglalink continues to invest in efficient data networks and expanding the coverage, aiming to substantially improve its 3G network coverage, which covered 59% of the population at the end of Q4 2016.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
 



Average Revenue per User ("ARPU"): Average monthly recurrent revenue per customer (excluding visitors roaming revenue and connection fee). This includes airtime revenue (national and international), as well as, monthly subscription fee, SMS, GPRS & data revenue. Quarterly ARPU is calculated as an average of the last three months. 
 
Capital Expenditure ("CAPEX"): Tangible and Intangible fixed assets additions during the reporting period, includes work in progress, network, IT, and other tangible and intangible fixed assets additions but excludes license fees. 
 
Churn: Disconnection rate. This is calculated as the number of disconnections during a month divided by the average customer base for that month.





Churn Rule: A customer is considered churned (removed from the customer base) if he exceeds the 90 days from the end of the validity period without recharging. It is worth noting that the validity period is a function of the scratch denomination. In cases where scratch cards have open validity, the customer is considered churned in case he has not made a single billable event in the last 90 days (i.e. outgoing or incoming call or sms, wap session). Open cards validity is applied for OTA, Mobilink and banglalink so far. 
 
Minutes of Usage ("MOU"): Average airtime minutes per customer per month.  This includes billable national and international outgoing traffic originated by customers (on-net, to land line & to other operators). Also, this includes incoming traffic to customers from landline or other operators. 
 
Organic Growth for Revenue and EBITDA: Are non-IFRS financial measures that reflect changes in Revenue and EBITDA excluding foreign currency movements and other factors, such as business under liquidation, disposals, mergers and acquisitions. We believe readers of this earnings release should consider these measures as it is more indicative of the Group's ongoing performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate the Group's operational results and trends. 



 
EPS: Earning per share is the profit for the period divided by the total number of outstanding shares

DISCLAIMER
This presentation is for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy shares in Global Telecom Holding (the "Company"). Further, it does not constitute a recommendation by the Company or any other party to sell or buy shares in the Company or any other securities. 
This presentation includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "believes", "estimates", "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "plans", "goal", "target", "aim", "may", "will", "would", "could" or "should" or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this presentation, including, without limitation, those regarding the Company's prospects, Algeria transformation program, and capital expenditure and growth strategies are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, financial condition, performance, liquidity, dividend policy or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the Company's present and future business strategies and the environment in which the Company will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause the Company's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the prices of the Company's products and services, the actions of competitors, the availability of credit, governmental regulation of the telecommunications industry in countries in which the Company operates, the effects of political uncertainty and economic conditions in the relevant areas in the world, the impact of foreign currency rates, taxation and unforeseen litigation. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law or regulatory obligation including under the rules of the Egyptian Exchange and the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
