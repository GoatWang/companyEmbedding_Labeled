Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to NTELOS Holdings Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, transaction related costs, restructuring and asset impairment charges, gain/loss on sale or disposal of assets and derivatives, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, other expenses/income, equity-based compensation charges, separation charges, secondary offering costs, adjustments for impact of recognizing deferred gain associated with towers sold to Grain Management  and adjustments for impact of recognizing a portion of the billed SNA contract revenues on a straight line basis.
ABPU, or average billings per user, is computed by adding average monthly postpaid service billings to users and equipment installment plan (EIP) billings divided by the average number of postpaid users during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. NTELOS believes average postpaid customer billings per user is indicative of estimated cash collection, including equipment installments, from customers each month.
Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by investors to determine if the Company is generating sufficient cash flows to continue to produce shareholder value and provide liquidity for future growth. ABPU provides management with useful information concerning the appeal of the Company's postpay rate plans and service offerings and the Company's performance in attracting and retaining high value customers.
Adjusted EBITDA and ABPU are non-GAAP financial performance measures. They should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Please refer to the exhibits and materials posted on the Company's website for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial performance measures to the most comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP and for a discussion of the presentation, comparability and use of such financial performance measures.

Effective 5/1/14, SNA Revenues include the impact of recognizing the fixed fee element of SNA contract revenues on a straightline basis, which is a reduction of





billed revenue, and the non-cash consideration attributable to spectrum leases.  We have recognized an equal charge for spectrum lease expense within 





cost of sales and services.

Average monthly billings per user (ABPU) is computed by dividing postpay service revenues and equipment installment plan (EIP) billings per period by the average number of postpay subscribers during that period. ABPU as defined may not be similar to ABPU measures of other companies, is not a measurement under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company closely monitors the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on ABPU in order to determine their effectiveness.  ABPU provides management useful information concerning the appeal of NTELOS rate plans and service offerings and the Company's performance in attracting and retaining high-value customers.
