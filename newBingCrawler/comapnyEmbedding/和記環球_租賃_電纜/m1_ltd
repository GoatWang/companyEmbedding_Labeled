Description
M1 by B&G™ is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system designed for small to medium manufacturers including job shops, custom and mixed mode manufacturers and make to order manufacturers.
  M1 by B&G™ provides total integration and automation from quoting through invoicing and unlike other systems
 M1 allows the manufacturer to simply and easily customize the system to suit their unique business processes maintaining their competitive edge.  Developed for Microsoft SQL Server and with a Microsoft Outlook, look and feel,
 M1 is an intuitive and user friendly system packed with innovative and powerful tools.
At the heart of the systems architecture is the concept of seamlessness - the ability to drag, point and click from module to module without awkward transition points or file conversion.
  M1 is a modular system so a manufacturer only has to purchase the modules that suit their business right now
and as they grow they can add new features and functionality when they are required.
  M1 has even been designed for the smallest organization where one person can do all tasks, no departmenatlised task orientation, and yet the design still is suited to medium and larger sized companies,
 M1 is capable of handling true small to medium operations.
M1's range of advanced productivity tools; graphs, calendars, explorers, wizards, drill downs, power search, shortcuts and smart screen technology provides management intelligence data at a click of a button and the automation of tasks to increase user efficiency.  M1 Design studio even lets you add new fields, customise any input form and report, giving companies the ability to make the system work for their business without changing any of their business processes.
M1 has been designed so there is no long and drawn-out expensive implementation cycle, the implementation tools coupled with the intuitive and familiar look and feel mean a company can be live and enjoying the benefits of the system within weeks.

Innovation
The Innovation in the functionality of
 M1 is what stands the system apart from the other products on the market today.
  Bowen & Groves have focused the design of the system on delivering a system where the user can be more efficient and productive, and this is achieved by focusing the depth of functionality on the simplest tasks, whereas other systems take the most amount of time for simple and routine functions.
Smart Screen Technology – The traditional design for systems is to operate in a resolution of 800x600 pixels and function with multiple screens.
  M1 is designed to operate in a resolution of 1024x768 pixels and automatically condenses the screen to only display to a user those fields that they actually require to carry-out the operation.  No need like other systems to tab through the useless fields that are not required to be entered
 M1 will not display the sections that you don’t require based on the function that you are performing.  For example if you are creating a purchase order you have two types, either a job purchase or an inventory purchase, when you create the inventory purchase you don’t need the fields that link to the job so
 M1 will collapse that section of the data and the user will only see the fields that are required for an inventory purchase.
  M1 smart screens can even be customised through  M1 Design Studio, so this technology can even be defined by the user based on their unique requirements.  This intelligent automation of expanding and collapsing fields based on a users operational requirements means ease of use and efficient operation.
Navigation Innovation - Unlike other systems where a user needs to search for relevant data,
 M1 has been designed with a state of the art navigation tree so every possible piece of data a user would require can be selected from the tree without having to search and open dozens of windows.  For example call up an organisation and you can now view contacts, locations, attachments, leads, quotes, sales orders, jobs, pricing, aging accounts and more.
Search Power - Most systems allow you to search on one or two criteria's not
 M1 you can have as many filters as you like.
No double entry - Wizards have been designed throughout the system to pull data through, so enter a quote to a prospect once and you can pull that data with the click of a button into a sales order, job, shipment and invoice.
Integration -  M1 integrates with everyday word processing, spreadsheet and email functions so M1 will create follow up and appointments in your
email or fax quotes directly from your PC, you can even mail merge.
Design Studio - The most significant and innovative feature of
 M1 is that you can design  M1 to suit your business, unlike other systems where you fit the system, this means a companies competitive advantage in their unique processes  can be maintained.
  M1 Design Studio allows a user to make the software work for them, you can add new fields, change any input form, including moving objects around, you can customize any report, and all of this is maintained with every new upgrade.
Hundreds more innovations have been added to
 M1 to make the system user friendly and efficient including such things as; advanced productivity tools such as calendars, wizards, graphs, drill down reports, explorers, approvals & warnings, start page daily summary and best of all the
 M1 assistant  with the implementation checklist which minimises a companies implementation cycle and cost.

Performance
The key foundations of excellence principles of
 Bowen & Groves and  M1 are; understanding customer requirements, listening to customers, industry knowledge, technical knowledge, support and professionalism.  An ERP system is simply not just about innovative design, it is the package of innovative design, strength in ongoing development coupled with excellence in support and professional services.
M1's ongoing development is driven by the customer, all customers are encouraged to contribute their ideas for enhancements via direct communication with the support team, at the annual user conference or the
 M1 user group.  We receive over 100 enhancement requests per quarter, these are real ideas for new features and new functionality.  In September 2003
 M1 version 3.0 was released and this included three new modules and over 370 additional enhancements to various modules, these are all the result of listening and responding to the customers.
The support system
 Bowen & Groves have put in place is absolutely world class, it is designed for enquiries to be handled quickly and efficiently.  Support is provided in three ways; telephone, modem dial-in or internet (BGSupportnet).  Telephone support is provided via a toll free telephone hotline, there is no automated phone system that places a customer in a queue, a real person answers the call and can respond directly, 90% of calls are solved within 10 minutes.  All calls received are logged and after a call is closed, a fax or email is automatically sent to the caller to ensure that they are satisfied that the call is closed and it requests the caller to rate their satisfaction level.  In the past three months we took 2635 calls and our average service rating was 9.1 (out of 10).  The BGSupportNet is an interactive support system where a customer can log on to the internet, review open and closed calls, support contracts, log on new calls or look at the knowledgebase.
So what do the customers have to say;

Potential
M1 by B&G has been developed in Australia by
 Bowen & Groves Pty Ltd an Australian company.   M1 was launched in April of 2000 at National Manufacturers Week and in 3 ½ years we now have more than
300 customers spanning five countries.
Whilst  M1 was launched in Australia first the design of the system was developed to suit the international marketplace with specific focus on meeting the needs of the USA/Canada and UK small to medium manufacturers.
In October of 2000
 M1 was launched in the USA and now accounts for more than 60% of our customers -
183 in total.
M1's development was focused on meeting the needs of small to medium manufacturers as well as meeting their future needs as they grow, unlike our many competitors in the small to medium segment, they are solely focused on meeting a small companies immediate needs but don't have the functionality to support their growth and thus as they grow they will have to change their ERP system or add additional systems that are not integrated.
M1 provides the opportunity to add functionality that is fully integrated to the system at any time, for example a manufacturer may just wish to start of with basic production and financials but later have the need for CRM, advanced production including revision control and serial numbering, payroll, point of sale or even internet based tracking and shopping.
M1 is truly a global product that has potential beyond just Australia and the USA, every country has small to medium jobshops, and custom and mixed mode manufacturers that need a system that makes manufacturing easier.

Gave them a basic drawing and they came and built is a beautiful deck! It's now a wonderful living space we enjoy! Great service friendly workers.  I'd recommend them any day!Jaime Misura Tessier · 2017年3月8日M1 did an outstanding job on our front entrance reno (new tile,closet door and  railings). The quality of workmanship and attention to detail exceeded my expectations. We will certainly be calling Geoff for all our future reno/constructions projects. 10 stars!!!!!Kevin Kraiger · 2016年1月4日Geoff did a great job on our basement. From framing to fine finishing! Geoff was super easy to work with, great communication and quick action to help navigate ⋯⋯us through the project. He made suggestions and took care of every detail managing our costs very nicely at each step to come in on quote and also delivering the custom elements we wanted in a craft room and granite bar area with fridge. We wanted to match our main floor look from paint to flooring and finish look as our house is only 4 years old so it would look like the builder did it. He did it perfectly for us. Please feel free to contact me to see his work or ask questions. Thanks. 更多Melody Terrill · 2015年7月22日I would like to give a commendation to M1 Construction Ltd. Geoff and Andre for the hard work and fantastic job they did on adding an addition to our existing d⋯⋯eck, along with a staircase to give access into our yard. Geoff; thank-you for your ideas in making the deck addition such a nice space! We are very impressed with the professionalism and great work with our project. Right through to completion these guys were there to ensure customer satisfaction. Very impressed with clean-up at the end of the project; our yard was put back in complete order as when they arrived! I highly recommend the work of M1 Construction Ltd. and their expedient work! Thank-you!! Melody & Elmer Mogenson 更多Lynne Fisher · 2015年1月16日The Capilano house that you see below is ours. The transformation from what it was only 3 months ago is nothing short of miraculous! Geoff and his team conducte⋯⋯d this job with absolute professionalism and care. Without exception, he delivered on his promises, always responded to our calls and e-mails, and applied a level of care and attention to his work that was second to none. I'd actually say more, but I don't really want anyone to know about him, as we have asked him to take on another job for us....this will be the third time that we will have hired him..... We absolutely and unconditionally recommend him, and if you don't believe this post, give me a call directly. Lynne Fishe 更多Muriel Ricketts · 2016年7月1日It's always a little scary when looking for home renovation contractors, however when I was asking around for reputable contractors, there was 1 name that kept ⋯⋯on being repeated. That name was M1 Construction. I was really impressed with what I had heard and my husband said "give them a call". Geoff called back the same day that I left my message and made arrangements to meet with me and look at my kitchen. Within no time Geoff came back with a design that captured everything that I wanted and then some. The cost was reasonable and the time frame for completion met with our needs. Geoff and Andre are perfectionists in their work and I couldn't be happier with the Reno. The kitchen Reno is complete and I was so pleased with the results that I am now getting my main washroom redone.  If your looking for a contractor, do not hesitate to call M1. You won't be disappointed. 更多Dianne Mitchell · 2015年5月5日Geoff just completed our kitchen reno (pictures posted on his main page as Beaumont Kitchen Reno). From the moment he came to see us and give us a quote to the ⋯⋯day the reno ended, Geoff was professional and helpful. He completely exceeded our expectations as a contractor. One of the details that impressed us the most was that any time we contacted him with a question he was fast to respond and always seemed to care. Thank you so much for the amazing job Geoff. 更多Julie Williams · 2015年1月16日We just had our basement finished by M1 Construction and are so happy with the results. The quality of the work was fantastic, and it was a breeze working with ⋯⋯Geoff throughout the process. He went above and beyond what he needed to do in order to have our basement finished in a timely manner and with superb quality! We would highly recommend him to anybody! 更多Cherise Hunter · 2016年10月30日I am proud to be part of M1 construction's team. Basement renovations, new home construction and commercials spaces. Every space that I have had the opportunity to paint for M1 has been very modern and constructed with great care and skill.Amy Lynn · 2016年3月17日Geoff built our garage, he is super professional, the job was done very quickly and we are extremely satisfied with the end product! Would recommend him for any job!Matt Tainsh · 2016年6月15日Geoff and Andre did an amazing job with our basement!!! Would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.Robyn Hunting MacDonald · 2016年4月11日Geoff was super quick and helpful getting my roof back in shape after the wind we had - so glad I called him!顯示全部相片顯示全部影片I have been wanting to do this for some time. Thank you to the fantastic clients who trusted me enough to complete this shower in their home!113查看全部貼文M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Basements & Secondary Suites 相簿中新增了 9 張相片。 · 7月31日 19:22 · Beaumont Basement還有 6 張M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Deck & Fence 相簿中新增了 3 張相片。 · 7月31日 19:19 · 2 level Curved Cedar Deck in Beaumont, Just waiting for the custom fit aluminum railing.顯示全部貼文M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Finishing 相簿中新增了 5 張相片。 · 6月5日 · Bench, door, wainscoting and flooring in front entrance還有 2 張M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Basements & Secondary Suites 相簿中新增了 5 張相片。 · 6月5日 · Legalized basement suite in Capilano還有 2 張M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Deck & Fence 相簿中新增了 2 張相片。 · 6月5日 · M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Deck & Fence 相簿中新增了 6 張相片。 · 5月24日 · 還有 3 張M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Bathroom Renovations 相簿中新增了 1 張相片。 · 5月24日 · Beaumont tub tile with wide nicheM1 Construction Ltd. 在 Basements & Secondary Suites 相簿中新增了 4 張相片。 · 5月24日 · Tamarak #2 BasementM1 Construction Ltd. 在 Stairs 相簿中新增了 9 張相片。 · 3月30日 · Laminate, hardwood, tile, vinyl plank, lino and carpet還有 6 張M1 Construction Ltd. 新增了 6 張相片。 · 3月30日 · Last year we had a client that was getting water in their basement. The insurance company opened up the wall and found cracking in the foundation. After weeks of slow responses we got a call. Opening up more of the foundation wall we discovered the leak was only part of their problem, a large horizontal crack in the foundation with visible deflection in the wall existed. It ran the entire length of the west wall. Our engineer ended up designing an interior wall that would rep⋯⋯lace the strength needed to carry the weight of the house above as the original foundation wall was failing. Once the new wood framed structural wall was in place and the house was again on solid footing we were able to focus on the water issue. Instead of a patch and quick "fix" the client agreed to excavate the perimeter of the foundation down to the weeping tile and install a waterproofing membrane. We back filled with washed rock to facilitate drainage and topped the exterior system with layers of landscape fabric, clay and black dirt allowing them to re-plant some of the shrubs along the side of the house. Inside once we knew it would be a dry space again the insulation and drywall was re-installed. 更多還有 3 張M1 Construction Ltd. 在 Finishing 相簿中新增了 1 張相片。 · 3月30日 · Custom Built shelf and cabinets.

Product/Solution Description
Businesses which have not accepted card payments before and are operating only on cash and invoice terms can now turn to M1 mPOS (Mobile Point-of-Sale) solution. M1 mPOS lets every business, small or large, the opportunity to offer the convenience of card payment to their customers, anytime, anywhere – a financially viable solution for SMEs and SoHo businesses to take up that cuts down the application approval time, provides the convenience of anywhere/anytime mobility, as well as removes the financial burden of deposits and monthly payments of traditional point-of-sale solutions.
M1 mPOS, launched in collaboration with CIMB, MasterCard and Wirecard, comprises of a physical card-reader that connects to your smartphones /tablets, transforming it into a secured mobile point-of-sale terminal, utilizing 3G/4G /WiFi networks for connection, to allow merchants to accept credit and debit card payments from customers anytime, anywhere.
The M1 mPOS solution is designed to meet the needs of traditionally cash-based small businesses, start-ups, and ‘on-the-go’ enterprises, to allow them to offer the convenience of a simple, safe and secure card payment experience to their customers through a wireless Internet connection.
Since launch, many customers have benefitted from this service – including many non-traditional merchants – such as home bakers, repairmen, private tutors, caterers, pushcart retailers, delivery service, plumbers, and locksmiths – who can now go to where the customers are.
Benefits
For M1, the M1 mPOS solution complements our suite of mobile and fixed connectivity services for the SME/SOHO segment.
M1 mPOS was conceptualized and developed with SMEs and SoHos in mind, a segment underserved by existing banks or held back as they were unable to meet the pre-requisites for card payment acceptance. The financial obligations involved (deposit, minimum guarantee, high rates, and monthly service charge) to provide traditional card acceptance facilities to customers make it prohibitive for small merchants to do so.
M1 mPOS encourages SMEs to take the first step in adopting smart payment solutions – through the acceptance of card payments (to replace cash transactions). This, indirectly, encourages the digitization of their businesses through the use of smart devices (smartphones and tablets) to process sales transactions and accept payments, as well as cost savings from reduced cash handling, loss of business, and potential theft.
M1 mPOS also has the potential to improve customer experience – redefining business delivery where retail assistants and cashiers can be the same person – processing payments on the spot at customer’s location, without having to handover customers.
