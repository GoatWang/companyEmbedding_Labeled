Advancing a novel approach to target tumor suppressor p53 to treat patients with a wide variety of cancers







Engaging the body's natural defense against cancerAileron is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel class of therapeutics called stapled peptides. Our lead product candidate ALRN-6924, which is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, reactivates p53-mediated tumor suppression by targeting both of the primary p53 suppressor proteins, MDMX and MDM2. The p53 protein is long known for its central role in preventing cancer initiation and progression, and its inactivation is essential for the formation of virtually all cancers. We believe that ALRN-6924 is the first and only product candidate in clinical development that can disrupt the interaction of both MDMX and MDM2 to restore p53 function as the body’s first line of defense against cancer.Based on preclinical data and preliminary evidence of safety and anti-tumor activity in our ongoing clinical trials, we believe there may be significant opportunity to develop ALRN-6924 as a monotherapy or combination therapy. We plan to leverage our proprietary stapled technology to develop additional product candidates across oncology and other diseases with unmet medical need.Read MoreNews
