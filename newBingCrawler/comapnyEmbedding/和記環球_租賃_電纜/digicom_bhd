        Digi's consumption behavioural analysis to unearth new revenue streams

PETALING JAYA: Digi.com Bhd’s move to analyse digital consumption behaviour, among others, is sensible and has potential to generate new revenue streams, according to a research house.

DiGi has embarked on analysing digital consumption behaviour to better understand its customer base.

CIMB Research, which is maintaining its Hold call on the stock with an unchanged target price of RM5.00, in a research note said the move would not only aid DiGi in terms of its own product design, but would also help to position it as a valuable partner for over-the-top-content (OTT) players, advertising networks and digital publishers to generate new revenue streams.

“We see this as a sensible approach (with minimal risk), leveraging its inherent assets (i.e. deep customer insights) to carve out a position in the digital value chain, though big contributions are unlikely in the near-term,’’ it noted.

The telco at the same time sees huge opportunity in the enterprise market as it is under-represented, and estimates the market’s worth to be RM1bil. 

The research house added DiGi believes that it can service this segment now by leveraging on its better and wider network coverage (including new 4G-900MHz network), developing/offering useful and innovative ICT solutions (e.g. iFleet) and improving customer experience at all touch points to address the needs of premium enterprise customers.

“We maintain our Hold call and discounted cash flow (DCF) based target price of RM5.00 (weighted average cost of capital (WACC): 7.0%). Structurally, we see DiGi as a beneficiary of the market heading closer to network parity post 900MHz spectrum reallocation. 

“However, we see subdued earnings in the near term given intense prepaid competition,’’ it noted.

DiGi also aims to deliver a better, faster and more convenient digital customer experience across all touch points, via MyDigi app for direct engagement (e.g. self-serve/anytime customer support, personalised offers, etc.), native in-app (e.g. YouTube) upselling at the right time to capture demand and a mobile sales app to accelerate expansion of touchpoints and new SIM activation. 

Besides cost benefits, CIMB Research believe proper execution could lead to more effective sales/marketing and market share gains over time.

Governance
We recognise that our success as a company lies in our ability to provide valuable services to our customers and as importantly, in the way we conduct our business responsibly and with great accountability.
Upholding high standards of corporate ethics is key to long-term value creation and contributes directly to improved business performance. And we have sharpened our strategy to further emphasise the need to maintain a culture that safeguards the responsible and sustainable business practices we are known for, built on a solid foundation of strong moral values and a deep sense of integrity.
This is maintained by establishing a business environment with partners who share our commitment to high standards of ethics and integrity, and ensuring the right principles of anti-corruption, customer privacy, consumer responsibility, supply chain sustainability, and safe use of equipment are upheld across our business. We remain committed to continuously meeting and setting the standard of excellence in this area within the industry.
