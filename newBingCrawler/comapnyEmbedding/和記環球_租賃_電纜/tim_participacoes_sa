Company Overview

Taking peer performance into consideration, relative performance over the last month and last year is around the peer median.


It’s current Price/Book of 1.35 is about median in its peer group.


The market expects faster earnings growth from TIMP3-BR than from its peers and also a turnaround in its current ROE.


TIMP3-BR has relatively low profit margins and median asset efficiency.


Changes in annual earnings are in line with its chosen peers but lags in terms of revenue, implying the company is cost conscious and selective about spending for growth.


TIMP3-BR‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years is around the peer median and suggest that it does not have any particular operational advantages versus peers.


Company appears to give away relatively high gross margins to relatively high operating costs suggesting a differentiated product portfolio with low pre-tax margins relative to peers.


While TIMP3-BR‘s revenues have increased slower than peer median, the market currently gives the company a higher than peer median P/E ratio and may be factoring in some sort of a strategic play.


The company’s capital investment seems appropriate for a business with peer median returns.


TIMP3-BR does not seem to have the flexibility to raise more debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
TIMP3-BR does not seem able to raise more debt easily.

TIMP3-BR‘s  debt at 29.77% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 21.05%), and interest coverage level of 2.08x, would make major new borrowings difficult.


Of the 4 chosen peers for the company, only 2 of the stocks have an outstanding debt balance. Companies with no debt include ATOM3-BR.

TIMP3-BR has moved towards a median liquidity and leverage from a relatively high leverage profile at the recent year-end.

TIMP3-BR‘s interest coverage is its lowest relative to the last five years and compares to a high of 10.04x in 2012.


Compared to 2016, interest coverage has remained relatively stable for both the company (2.08x) and the peer median (4.03x).


TIMP3-BR‘s debt-EV continues to trend downward and is below (but within one standard deviation of) its five-year average debt-EV of 30.52%.


The decrease in its debt-EV to 29.77% from 39.12% (in 2016) was also accompanied by a decrease in its peer median during this period to 21.05% from 23.22%.


Relative to peers, debt-EV fell 7.19 percentage points. Unlike the peer median, it is also above the 25% leverage benchmark.

Through GSM technology, TIM has a national range of approximately 95% of the urban population, being the largest GSM coverage in Brazil, with presence in 3,383 cities. TIM also relies on an extensive data coverage throughout the country, being 100% GPRS, 94% with EDGE, in addition to having a sophisticated Third Generation (3G) network available to over 72% of the Brazilian urban population. The Company also has international roaming agreements for TIM customers, more than 450 networks are available in over 208 countries on six continents.

TIM brand has a strong association with innovation and quality attributes. During its presence in the country, it has become the pioneer in launching several products and services, such as the introduction of MMS and Blackberry in Brazil. Continuing this trend, the Company added to its portfolio, in 2010, new and innovating offerings, always seeking to keep the positioning as the operators that makes “Plans and Promotions that Revolutionize”. TIM has evolved its two families of plans – ‘Infinity’ e ‘Liberty’ – by launching the offerings ‘Infinity Web’ and ‘Liberty Web’ in order to meet the growing demand for data services.

Furthermore, it has also introduced the pay per call concept for calls to fixed numbers through ‘Infinity Mais’ offering. The portfolio is based on an innovating concept, with great incentive to usage (tariffs per call, unlimited use) and always exploiting TIM’s community sense, with over 70 million lines throughout the country. TIM Participações is a subsidiary of TIM Brasil Serviços e Participações S.A., a Telecom Itália group company. Innovation and quality are two of the strategic pillars TIM shares with its parent company. For this, TIM substantially invests in network and IT, and maintains synergies with its controlling group through the sharing of experience and the adoption of best practices, always ensuring innovative experiences to all of its clients.

During 2010, the Company continued with the integration process with Intelig, which was merged in December 2009. The latter operates as a fixed, long-distance and data transmission provider in Brazil. The merger expanded TIM network infrastructure, so that it was possible to speed up 3G network development, optimize leased line costs, and also improve our competitive positioning in the telephony market.

In 2011, TIM Celular acquired 100% of Eletropaulo Telecomunicações Ltda. and 98.3% of AES Communications Rio de Janeiro S.A., later renamed TIM Fiber SP Ltda. and TIM Fiber RJ S.A., respectively. The acquisition represents a significant expansion of infrastructure, adding a fiber optic network with more than 5,500 km in 21 cities of the metropolitan regions of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

TIM Participações is a publicly-held company, whose shares are listed on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) and ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). It is also one of the select group of companies included in the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBOVESPA. In August 2011 TIM became the only telecom operator in the highest level of Corporate Governance of Bovespa, called Novo Mercado.
