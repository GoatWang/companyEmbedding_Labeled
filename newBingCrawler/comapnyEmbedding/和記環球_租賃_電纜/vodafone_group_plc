Since 2006, the EVO program has encouraged Vodafone to pursue best practices in every aspect of what it does. Using SAP ERP and associated applications as the single, integrated platform for their business, Vodafone has been able to pinpoint where they spend money, share data across the organization, and implement mobile solutions to improve productivity.
Planning ahead…

The Challenge






























Achieving Internal and External Excellence

The focus on best practices prompts Vodafone to continually seek areas for improvement, including coping with the complexity of the data in the market. Month-end closing is a critical process that also happens to be highly visible. The availability of financial information is critical to managers who need it to respond to changing business conditions. Timely information supports timely decision making, so Vodafone set the goal of reducing their month-end closing process.
 













Another goal of Vodafone Group is to maximize savings while minimizing risk. This requires visibility into spending that helps proactively identify savings opportunities and control supplier risk.

Customer churn is another key issue Vodafone sought to address. Since there is no single characteristic that can identify a customer who is likely to change mobile providers, Vodafone Netherlands wanted to figure out a way to make the most of their scarce analytics resources and apply findings to minimize customer turnover.

Trusted Partner and Preferred Supplier



The largest IT transformation in Vodafone’s history began in 2006, when Accenture and SAP collaborated to deliver a single platform for finance, HR, and supply chain across 20 operating companies. Over the years, this has meant addressing considerable challenges of scale and complexity. As Vodafone’s global delivery partner, Accenture has worked side by side with Vodafone to design and deliver the overall solution in all locations.



Several years ago, Vodafone embarked on a journey of three key global implementations:
















ERP

 to standardize and globalize core processes















Business Intelligence 

360° understanding of procurement expenditures, negotiate better prices, and service with suppliers















Mobility

to empower employees with access to core systems via mobile devices





















 




















Accenture has focused on maximizing the reuse of assets, making best use of and optimizing Vodafone’s mix of offshore and specialist resources, and deploying a comprehensive suite of tools to achieve high levels of automation. By adopting an industrialized approach, Accenture was able to drive major cost savings and realize the value that Vodafone had set for the program.
Handling the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

SAP, Accenture, and Vodafone have worked closely to deliver meaningful results as part of the EVO program. The SAP HANA implementation was completed within one month-end closing period. SAP Spend Performance Management software has delivered comprehensive reporting and process functionality to power smarter purchasing decisions throughout Vodafone Group. 






















 




















Vodafone engaged SAP MaxAttention™ services to analyze the underlying technical platform, identify ways to improve stability and performance and improve the system. With the recommendation s made by SAP MaxAttention, Vodafone then implemented all critical improvements, resulting in a highly stable, efficient overall system.

Closing Books and Opening Opportunities



Month-end closing has been improved at Vodafone through a combination of system and process improvements. After implementing SAP HANA, Vodafone cut an entire day out of their closing process.












 




















Vodafone had been using SAP Business Warehouse in the data flow, but using the reporting application for operations was a time-consuming process of iterative extract-transform-load (ETL) database cycles. Now that they Run Live with SAP HANA, Vodafone can analyze large amounts of data in local memory, eliminating the need for multiple ETLs.














Vodafone is able to integrate spending data with other key information and keep it within a secure loop of sourcing and spend management that helps identify risks, such as single-supplier dependencies, while helping control spending through accurate information and performance targets.
Analyzing exactly how money is getting spent.












 




















For instance, the telecommunications company is profiling winter sports enthusiasts to identify who may be interested in a mobile roaming product that makes it easy for them to use their phones in the mountains.
Speed, ease of use and scalability to add more and more data.

To Run Live like this means a 96% reduction in process times, and Vodafone can save approximately €500,000 in labor costs over the next four years. SAP Spend Performance Management is helping Vodafone optimize their spending strategies with features including what-if simulations, which can help the company set and manage higher goals for spend under management.

With SAP HANA Margin Assurance, Vodafone now has a granular view of customer profitability with less personnel dedicated to the task, showing exactly how much spend to allocate for each special offer and discount, enabling Vodafone to identify tens of millions of previously unidentified revenue leakage.

The ability to understand granular customer profitability specifically which customers are profitable or unprofitable and why, is a game-changer for our industry.

Time on Their Hands Is Money in the Bank

Now in production, the new month-end close process is giving Vodafone greater flexibility than ever. Data extract, transform, and load cycles are 25 times faster, ending the dreaded 16-hour days that workers faced during the old process. Employees are now free to contribute at higher levels, resulting in higher job satisfaction and greater business innovation. Data analysts and business decision makers are also more productive because they have the information they need much sooner.













Modeling that would have taken weeks to produce by a team of statisticians can now be completed in only two days by one or two experienced analysts at Vodafone Netherlands. The analysis can also be presented in formats that can direct the actions of marketers, such as when to contact customers with a certain message, and when not to over-contact customers.












 




















As a result, Vodafone was the WINNER for Digital Trailblazer for the SAP HANA Innovation Award in 2016 by harnessing the power of Big Data and the Internet of Things to Run Live for breakthrough results.
More and more quantity created a step change in quality.

















Journey Ahead





Promoting the Internal Success Story



Vodafone is now refining its month-end closing process. For example, they have introduced a set of preliminary reports using the SAP HANA data. These reports can provide advance notice of approximate results, allowing stakeholders to prepare accordingly for final results.












 




















In addition, Vodafone has several potential plans for broadening the applicability of SAP HANA to their business needs in business functions outside finance. Meanwhile, SAP Spend Performance Management continues to help Vodafone uncover new ways to save money and mitigate risk through consolidated analysis.
Looking ahead to gaining more insight across all aspects of business.























 




















Continued support throughout the digital transformation journey.














Now that we have proven the value of SAP HANA, we’re telling the rest of the company that we have a new addition to the analysis tools from SAP that we have been making available for years – one that offers incredible acceleration for any application where speed is important.

    OFT closed case: Anticipated acquisition by Vodafone Group plc of Project Telecom plc.
  






Affected market: Telecommunications
No. ME/1312/03
PARTIES
Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone) is a mobile network operator (MNO) in the
UK. It operates at both the network (wholesale) and service provider
(retail) level of the mobile communications sector. Project Telecom plc
(Project Telecom) is an independent service provider (ISP) of mobile
telecommunication services in the UK. Project Telecom's turnover for
the year ended 31 December 2002 was £315 million.
TRANSACTION
Vodafone is seeking to acquire the entire share capital of Project
Telecom for £155 million.
JURISDICTION
As a result of this transaction Vodafone and Project Telecom will cease
to be distinct. The UK turnover of Project Telecom exceeds £70 million,
so that the turnover test in section 23(1)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002
(the Act) is satisfied. A relevant merger situation will be created.
RELEVANT MARKET
The parties overlap in the provision of mobile communication services at
retail level (to personal and corporate users). Vodafone, as an MNO,
also supplies mobile communication services at the wholesale level to
ISPs such as Project Telecom.
Product market
On the demand-side, due to the way in which airtime is sold, it is
likely that the supply of mobile telecommunications services to retail
and wholesale customers should be considered separately. Retail
customers (personal and corporate users) would not, in the event of a
price increase by all retail suppliers (including tied service providers
(TSPs)), be able to buy directly from an MNO. Project Telecom buys
wholesale airtime for resale to mainly corporate, but also personal,
customers. Vodafone, through its TSPs, provides mobile telecommunication
services to both corporate and personal customers. Of Vodafone's 12.4
million network customers, [1.5 million – 3 million] (see note
1) are serviced through ISPs like Project Telecom. The specific
characteristics of mobile telephony mean that customers do not consider
land line telephony to be a viable substitute.
On the supply-side, it appears likely that suppliers of mobile
telecommunication services to personal customers could quickly and
easily switch to provide services to business customers. They would have
to bid for contracts that are put out to tender by corporate customers
and may have to develop additional services such as conference calling.
The parties submit that the range of services offered to corporate and
personal customers is similar.
Geographic market
OFTEL maintains that the geographic scope of the market for wholesale
mobile telecommunication services is the UK because of a uniform pricing
policy and a lack of demand and supply side substitutability from
markets outside the UK. It is likely that, for similar reasons, at the
retail level the geographic scope is also national.
For the purposes of analysing the competitive constraints on the parties
pre- and post-merger the appropriate frame of reference will be taken to
be the supply of mobile telecommunication services at the retail level
in the UK.
HORIZONTAL ISSUES
Post-merger at the retail level, Vodafone would have a [15-20 per
cent] (see note 1) market share, increment [<5 per cent]
(see note 1), by subscriber numbers or [25-30 per cent] (see
note 1), increment of 1.3 per cent, by retail revenues. If
Vodafone's acquisition of Singlepoint is completed, this would increase
Vodafone's share of supply by a further [<5 per cent] (see note
1) by subscriber numbers. Post-merger the parties will face
competition from other MNOs as well as a larger number of ISPs.
Barriers to entry
Third parties had mixed views about the costs of entry at retail level.
Recently there has been a number of firms entering and exiting the
market. BT and Tesco have recently entered into partnership agreements
with T-Mobile and O2 respectively to provide mobile services to personal
consumers. As a result of this new entry and continued growth of
existing ISPs, OFTEL believes that the removal of the requirement on
Vodafone and O2 to sell on a non-discriminatory basis to ISPs has not
created a barrier to entry. OTFEL has found that while personal
customers face some barriers to switching related to number portability
and handset unlocking, they have been reduced over time. Vodafone's
customer churn is around 30 per cent per annum.
Buyer power
Personal customers are unlikely to have any negotiating strength. One
third party thought that corporate customers may have some buyer power
as they purchase services through a competitive tendering process and
have a number of providers from which to choose.
VERTICAL ISSUES
Vodafone is active as an MNO at the wholesale level and as a TSP at the
retail level. Its share of supply at the wholesale level was 29.9 per
cent by volume of call minutes and 33.5 per cent by value for the period
April 2002 - March 2003. OFTEL considers that no MNO or group of MNO has
significant market power. It is therefore highly unlikely that it can
leverage its position in the supply of wholesale airtime to influence
the supply of airtime to retail customers. ISPs can switch between MNOs,
although Orange does not currently supply any ISPs. Moreover, the
transaction results in such a small increment to Vodafone's share of
supply (at the retail level), even if Vodafone did possess some market
power at the wholesale level, the transaction is unlikely to increase
the possibility of foreclosure at the retail level.
THIRD PARTY VIEWS
A number of ISPs are concerned about the transaction, but these related
more to wider sectoral issues, in particular, the removal of the
requirement on Vodafone and O2 to sell on a non-discriminatory basis to
ISPs. MNOs and customers are generally not concerned. OFTEL is
unconcerned about the merger because the increment to market share is
small and it does not view the decline in the number of ISPs as a
concern as there is strong retail competition between the TSPs.
ASSESSMENT
The appropriate frame of reference is taken to be the supply of mobile
telecommunications services at the retail level in the UK. Post-merger,
the parties will have a combined market share of [15-20 per cent] (see
note 1), increment [<5 per cent] (see note 1),
based on subscriber numbers or [25-30 per cent] (see note
1), increment 1.3 per cent, based on retail revenues. The
merged entity will continue face competition from around 50 other ISPs
and the other MNOs. Entry barriers do not appear to be insurmountable as
there have been a number of recent new entrants. Given that OFTEL has
concluded that Vodafone (either singly or as part of a group) does not
have significant market power and the increment to its share of supply
of retail services is small, the transaction does not appear to raise
any vertical competition concerns.
DECISION
This merger will therefore not be referred to the Competition Commission
under section 33(1) of the Act.

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]

In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]

On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]

In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

TECSOS – mobile phones have been adapted to allow victims of domestic violence to activate immediate contact with the emergency services if they are in danger
Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
Sir Gerald Whent, at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]
