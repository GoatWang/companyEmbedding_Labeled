History[edit]
In 1995, when Yasser Arafat set up the Palestine Telecommunications Co, only 3% of Palestinians owned a telephone;[7] applicants would have to wait years for a connection by Bezeq, the Israeli state-owned provider.[8] The initial three-year plan was to invest $600m in the West Bank and Gaza in order to increase customers from 85,000 to 250,000.[9] An agreement was reached in 1997 to acquire knowhow from Cable and Wireless,[10] and in 1998 Ericsson won the contract to supply a GSM cellular network.[11] That year Arafat called on mobile users to switch to Paltel which would soon become the sole providers for the two regions.[12]
The mobile operator of PaltelGroup, [clarification needed] with its 2 million subscribers,[13][14] has stopped a merger operation with Zain,[15] but still will join the One Network project in the year 2010.
In 2015, Paltel and fellow provider al-Wataniyya Telecommunications were granted access by Israeli authorities to use 3G, something they were previously restricted from doing.[16]
Controversies[edit]
In April 2016, the company's founding chief executive officer (CEO), Mohammad Mustafa, has been named in the Panama Papers.[17]

RAMALLAH, Palestine, July 29, 2011 /PRNewswire/ --
 

11.0% Growth in Net Revenues to reach US$ 257m
16.3% Growth in EBITDA to reach US$ 115m
16.3% Growth in Operating Income (EBIT) to reach US$ 91m
16.6% Growth rate in Net Income
Net Income reached US$ 67m
Total Assets reached US$ 762m
Shareholders Equity reached US$ 545m


H1-2011 Results
Sabih Masri, Chairman of the Palestine Telecommunications Company, PalTel announced the financial results for the first half of 2011 at a Board of Directors meeting held on July 27, 2011 in Amman, Jordan.  
Consolidated net operating revenues grew by 11.0% to reach US$ 257m at the end of H1-2011 compared with US$ 231m at the end of H1-2010.  In regards to the operating revenues of each segment, the company achieved a growth in its mobile, fixed Line and data revenues by 13.5%, 3.4%, and 67.2% respectively.
The consolidated operating income for the company reached US$ 91m by the end of H1-2011 compared with US$ 78m by the end of H1-2010, a growth of 16.3%.  This growth was achieved by an increase in consolidated revenues and in light of the positive effect of the new operating policy (strategy) focusing management efforts on core telecom functions and outsourcing support functions.
The consolidated net income increased by 16.6% to stand at US$ 67m at the end of H1-2011 compared with US$ 58m at the end of H1-2010.  The increase is operational driven (increase in operating income) with the other expenses including investment gains/losses, interest expense and other non-recurring expenses having a relatively minor effect on the percentage change mentioned above.  
Sabih Masri, Chairman of PalTel, emphasized that "the financial statements are a clear indication of our focus upon our core business operations in the fixed, mobile and data services which has further allowed our team to strive in our technical and administrative abilities to further develop our strategy in terms of current services and processes that utilize the latest technological developments.  Masri further stated that "such developments have proved to be vital in providing our customers what they need; improving current services being offered and growing our subscriber base. Our growth in performance is a direct result of the efforts of the Group companies in providing the latest developments in information and technology combined with its determination to lead the Palestinian community in providing advanced services in mobile, fixed and data communications for the benefit of all customers."      
Ammar Aker, CEO of Paltel Group, stated, "Our continued efforts and progress during the first half of the year has resulted in an increase in revenues and profits in all Paltel Group companies which is an indication of our hard working team's abilities to adapt and adjust to the demands of the competitive market.  The expansion in our core services to improve the quality and satisfaction for customers is being carried out in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the network in the Gaza Strip has improved in recent months due to our ability to transfer equipment into the area which has led to an increase in campaigns and improvement of services."  Aker also added that, "the Group companies are launching campaigns that stress technological developments that are in touch with global developments in telecom services in order to reach out to all Palestinian communities.  Such efforts are directly reflected in our positive growth in the market, where we continue to develop information technology services to meet the demand of all stakeholders."    
Current Operating Performance
Fixed Line
The number of fixed line subscribers witnessed 5.7% growth rate to stand at 383K subscribers compared with 362K as of the end of FY-2010. This growth resulted from new acquisition campaigns.  
The average monthly revenue per fixed line subscriber reached US$21.7 at the end of H1-2011 compared with US$22.3 at the end of FY-2010 and US$21.2 at the end of H1-2010.
Mobile
Mobile subscribers grew by 2.5% to stand at 2.31m at the end of H1-2011 compared with 2.26m at the end of FY-2010, and grew by 11.75% compared with the end of H1-2010 where the total number of subscribers was 2.07m. The composition (split between) of the prepaid and postpaid subscribers was 90.3% and 9.7% respectively.
This growth in the number of mobile subscribers was affected by several acquisition campaigns and new products and services that targeted existing and prospective customers.
The blended ARPU declined by 2.4% to reach US$15.0/subscriber/month during the first half of 2011 compared with US$15.4/subscriber/month in H1-2010, while it stood in line with the figure for FY-2010 where it was US$15.0/subscriber/month. This decrease in the ARPU H1-2011 vs. H1-2010 is attributable to the larger customer base, low ARPU of the new customers and to offering larger discounts to the customers.
Data
The data segment achieved a 27.6% growth rate in the number of ADSL lines to stand at 138K lines by the end of H1-2011 compared with 108K lines as of the end of FY-2010, and grew by 34.5% compared to H1-2010 where the base was 102K lines. This increase in customer base was accompanied by a decline in ARPU which reached US$21.6 in H1-2011 compared to US$25.4 by year end 2010. In addition, penetration rate of the ADSL lines (per landline) increased from 29.8% at the end of FY-2010 to 35.9% at the end of H1-2011.
Future Outlook
The company will continue to grow its customer base in its core services, Mobile, Fixed Line and Data services while meeting the demands of current customers who will be able to benefit from technological developments while receiving high quality and added value services.  Since some equipment is able to enter the Gaza Strip, we will continue to provide services to more than 40% of our customer base.  With more than 82% market share and with 50% penetration rate, we are still confident of capturing future growth in the telecom market in the Palestinian territories.

GDP per capita in the Palestinian territories rose by 7% per year from 1968 to 1980 but slowed during the 1980s. Between 1970 and 1991 life expectancy rose from 56 to 66 years, infant mortality per 1,000 fell from 95 to 42, the percentage of households with electricity rose from 30% to 85%, the percentage of households with safe water rose from 15% to 90%, the percentage of households with a refrigerator rose from 11% to 85%, and the percentage of households with a washing machine rose from 23% in 1980 to 61% in 1991.[13]
Economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza, where economic activity was governed by the Paris Economic Protocol of April 1994 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, deteriorated in the early 1990s. Real per capita GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36.1% between 1992 and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and robust population growth. The downturn in economic activity was due to extensive corruption in the newly governing Palestinian Authority[citation needed], and to Israeli closure policies in response to security incidents in Israel, which disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships. The most serious effect was the emergence of chronic unemployment. Average unemployment rates in the 1980s were generally under 5%; by the mid-1990s this level had risen to over 20%. After 1997, Israel's use of comprehensive closures decreased and new policies were implemented. In October 1999, Israel permitted the opening of a safe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the 1995 Interim Agreement. These changes in the conduct of economic activity fueled a moderate economic recovery in 1998–99.
As a result of the Israeli blockade, 85 percent of factories were shut or operated at less than 20 percent capacity. It is estimated that Israeli businesses lost $2 million a day from the closing while Gaza lost approximately $1 million a day.[14] The World Bank estimates the nominal GDP of the territories at 4,007,000 US$ and of Israel at 161,822,000 US$. Per capita these numbers are respectively 1,036 US$ and 22,563 US$ per year.
For 30 years, Israel permitted thousands of Palestinians to enter the country each day to work in construction, agriculture and other blue-collar jobs. Until the mid-1990s, up to 150,000 people—about a fifth of the Palestinian labor force—entered Israel each day. After Palestinians unleashed a wave of suicide bombings, the idea of separation from the Palestinians took root in Israel. Israel found itself starved for labor, and gradually replaced most of the Palestinians with migrants from Thailand, Romania and elsewhere.[15][16]
In 2005, the PNA Ministry of Finance cited the Israeli West Bank barrier, whose construction began in the second half of 2002, as one reason for the depressed Palestinian economic activity.[17] Real GDP growth in the West Bank declined substantially in 2000, 2001, and 2002, and increased modestly in 2003 and 2004.[18] The World Bank attributed the modest economic growth since 2003 to "diminished levels of violence, fewer curfews, and more predictable (albeit still intense) closures, as well as adaptation by Palestinian business to the contours of a constrained West Bank economy". Under a "disengagement scenario" the Bank predicted a real growth rate of −0.2% in 2006 and −0.6% in 2007.[19]
In the wake of Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza, there were shortages of bread and basic supplies due to closure of the al Mentar/Karni border-crossing into Israel. Israel's offer to open other crossings was turned down by the Hamas-run Palestinian authority.[20]
Following the January 2006 legislative elections, won by Hamas, the Quartet (apart from Russia) cut all funds to the Palestinian Authority led by prime minister Ismail Haniyah (Hamas). The Palestinian Authority had a monthly cash deficit of $60 million-$70 million after it received $50 million – $55 million a month from Israel in taxes and customs duties collected by Israeli officials at the borders. After the elections, the Palestinian stock market fell about 20 percent, and the Palestinian Authority exhausted its borrowing capacity with local banks.[21] Israel ceased transferring $55 million in tax receipts to the Palestinian Authority. These funds accounted for a third of the PA's budget and paid the wages of 160,000 Palestinian civil servants (among them 60 000 security and police officers). The United States and the European Union halted direct aid to the PA, while the US imposed a financial blockade on PA's banks, impeding some of the Arab League's funds (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Qatar) from being transferred.[22] In May 2006, hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated in Gaza and the West Bank demanding payment of their wages. Tension between Hamas and Fatah rose as a result of this "economic squeeze" on the PA.[23]
In 2009, the Israeli military removed its checkpoint at the entrance of Jenin in a series of reductions in security measures.[24] In September 2012 EU activists stated that the Palestinian economy "lost access to 40 percent of the West Bank, 82 percent of its groundwater and more than two-thirds of its grazing land" due to the occupation and settlement construction.[25]
The first planned Palestinian city named Rawabi is under construction north of Ramallah, with the help of funds from Qatar.[26] In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian territories were valued at US$20 billion annually.[27]
By sub-region[edit]
West Bank[edit]
In 2007, the economy in the West Bank improved gradually. Economic growth for the occupied areas reached about 4–5% and unemployment dropped about 3%. Israeli figures indicated that wages in the West Bank rose more than 20% in 2008 and trade rose about 35%. Tourism in Bethlehem increased to about twice its previous levels, and tourism increased by 50% in Jericho.[28] Life expectancy is 73.4, placing the territories 77th in the world, compared with a life expectancy of 72.5 in Jordan, and 71.8 in Turkey.[29] Car sales in 2008 were double those of 2007. The International Monetary Fund report for the West Bank forecast a 7 percent growth rate for 2009.
The Bethlehem Small Enterprise Center opened in early 2008. Funded by Germany, the center has helped to promote computer literacy and marketing skills.[28]

In 2009, efforts continued to build Palestinian local institutions and governments from the ground up. Much of this work was done by Tony Blair and US General Keith Dayton. Some analysts saw this as a more substantial way to lay a groundwork for viable institutions and for local peace.[30] In August 2009, a state of the art web-based system for tracking goods coming in and out of the area by Palestinian customs was launched in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.[31]
In 2009, an economic "boom" began with growth reaching 8 percent, higher than in Israel or the West. However, with inflation around 9.9% that same year, real economic growth is actually negative insofar as purchasing power has decreased. Tourism to Bethlehem, which had doubled to 1 million in 2008, rose to nearly 1.5 million in 2009. New car imports increased by 44 percent. New shopping malls opened in Jenin and Nablus. As an outcome of the Palestine Investment Conference, Palestinian developers are planning to build the first modern Palestinian city, Rawabi.[32][33]
In 2010, Ramallah was described as a hub of the economic activity thanks to the improved security situation, successful battle against corruption and large consumer base.[34]
In 2011, the Palestinian Planning Minister said that GDP growth was expected to reach 9 percent, rising to 10 percent in 2012 and 12 percent in 2013.[35]
East Jerusalem[edit]
East Jerusalem was once the business and shopping hub of the West Bank. However, since the advent of Israeli security checkpoints and the separation barrier starting over a decade ago, it has become isolated from its customer base leading to serious economic decline.[36] According to Hanna Siniora of the Palestinian-American Chamber of Commerce, the turning point was 1993. He states that since then East Jerusalem has become a closed city through isolation from the rest of the West Bank causing a loss of 50% of its business between 1993 and 2001.[37]
According to a 2012 report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and interviews conducted by the Forward, the decline of the economy in East Jerusalem has led to unprecedented levels of poverty, with 80% of the Palestinian population living below the poverty line. The main cause is seen as the political and physical barriers separating it from the rest of the West Bank. The ACRI report attributing the problem to "‘the cumulative effects of annexation, neglect, rights violations and the completion of the separation barrier."[36] Another contributing factor to the economic decline is the housing situation.[36] The Israeli government has facilitated extensive construction for Israeli settler neighborhoods, but has severely restricted development and building for the Palestinian population.[36]
In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian territories were valued at US$20 billion annually.[27]
Gaza Strip[edit]




Gaza City


According to Hamas, Israel's closure policy, which was extended when the Hamas administration came to power in 2007, was responsible for high levels of poverty and unemployment and a significant decline of the private sector which was heavily reliant upon export markets. Israel blamed Hamas for taking actions that led to the closure policy. A large part of the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance, primarily from the UN agencies.[38]
An easing of Israel's closure policy in 2010 resulted in an improvement in some economic indicators, but regular exports from the Gaza Strip were still prohibited.[38] According to the Israeli Defense Forces, the economy improved in 2011, with a drop in unemployment and an increase in GDP. New malls have opened, local industry is developing and the economic upswing has led to the construction of hotels and a rise in the import of cars.[39] Wide-scale development has been made possible by the unhindered movement of goods into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and tunnels between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The current rate of trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom is 250 trucks per day. This figure fluctuates depending on the level of interference with goods being brought into Gaza from Egypt through tunnels. The increase in building activity has led to a shortage of construction workers. To make up for the deficit, young people are being sent to learn the trade in Turkey.[40]
Taxation[edit]
Main article: Taxation in the Palestinian territories
Taxation is a complex system which may involve payment to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and/or Israel in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 2005 the Palestinian Authority collected approximately $34 million per month from taxes and other charges, and Israel collected about $75 million per month in tariffs on foreign imports and value added taxes (VAT) on Israeli goods and services and on average kept about $15 million for the payment of water and power bills of Palestinians, while forwarding the other $60 million to the PA.[41] Israeli collected funds account for about two-thirds of the authority's self-generated revenue,[42] which Reuters put at $100 million in December 2012.[43] Since the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Israel has regularly withheld the taxes it owes the Palestinian Authority.[41][43][44][45]
Employment[edit]
According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population.[46] Over the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in Gaza.[47]
By Israelis[edit]
Unemployment rates in the Palestinian economy led about 100,000 Palestinians to work in the Israeli economy sphere. By March 2014, about 45,000 permits were issued for work in Israel with further 25,000 issued for work in West Bank settlements. It is estimated 35,000 Palestinian work through illegal channels and without a permit. Recently the quote for permits has increased and minimum age for obtaining one was reduced from 26 to 24.Sectors in which Palestinians are employed include construction, manufacturing, commerce and agriculture.[48]
As of 2013, average daily wages is Israeli and settlements is nearly 2.2 times higher than in the private sector in the West Bank and over 4 times that in Gaza. Palestinian monthly minimum wage is NIS 1,450 almost a third of Israeli minimum wage of NIS 4,300. In the West Bank, Israeli Labour Laws are partially applied through military enactments and a ruling of the Supreme Court of Israel from 2007 apply the law for work done inside Israeli settlements. Yet, there have been incidents where Israeli employers did not fulfill their legal obligations to the employees by refusing to provide a paycheck or hide number of work hours in order to avoid labour laws such as minimum wage or social security benefits.[48][49]
In 2014, An article published on Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, the Palestinian Authority's official daily, praised Israeli treatment of Palestinian workers. With having added benefits such as transportation, medical and pensions, Palestinians are quick to leave their Palestinian employees and work for Israelis, whenever they have the opportunity to do so. Safety rules are enforced strictly by Israeli Workers' Union and physical examinations are done by doctors. While the PA has passed labour laws but do not enforce rules such as minimum wage, yearly vacation, sick leave or extra payment for additional work hours.[50][51][52]
Water supply and sanitation[edit]
Main article: Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories
Agriculture[edit]
Main article: Agriculture in the Palestinian territories
Agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and fuels Palestine's export economy.[46] According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population.[46] Around 183,000 hectares of land in the Palestinian territories are cultivated, of which around half is used for olive production.[53] Olive products earn more in export income than any other agricultural crop.[53]
Over the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine.
Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank.[54] Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.
Handicrafts[edit]
Main article: Palestinian handicrafts
A wide variety of handicrafts, many of which have been produced by Arabs in Palestine for hundreds of years, continue to be produced today. Palestinian handicrafts include embroidery work, pottery-making, soap-making, glass-making, weaving, and olive-wood and Mother of Pearl carvings, among others.[55][56] Some Palestinian cities in the West Bank, particularly Bethlehem, Hebron and Nablus have gained renown for specializing in the production of a particular handicraft, with the sale and export of such items forming a key part of each city's economy.
Stonecutting[edit]
Stonecutting is a traditional source of income for the Palestinian economy. The annual average output per worker in the stone industry is higher than in any other sector. There are 650 stone production outlets in the West Bank, 138 of them in Beit Fajjar. The quarried material is cut into a rich range of pink, sand, golden, and off-white bricks and tiles known as Jerusalem stone.[57]
Transportation[edit]
Main article: Transport in the Palestinian territories
Communications[edit]
Main article: Communications in the Palestinian territories
The World Bank estimated in 2016 that restrictive measures placed by Israel on telecommunication operators in the West Bank have had a notable negative impact on the development of the Palestinian telecommunications networks, which is sustaining losses in the range of $1 billion. These restrictive measures include the denial to operate in 60% of the West Bank under Israeli military administration (Area C), limitations on the importation of technology for ICT companies, requiring Palestinian operators to access international links via a company wioth Israeli registration, delaying in the provision of mobile broadband, the failure to set in place an independent regulator for the sector in the territories, and Israeli operators who lack appropriate authorizations who continue to operate in the Palestinian market.[58]
High-tech[edit]
During the 2000s, a high-tech sector emerged in the Palestinian territories, supported by its proximity to Israel, and by 2013, 4,500 Palestinians worked in the IT sector, specializing in software outsourcing (including outsourced work from Israeli companies), telecommunication development and manufacturing equipment.[59] The Palestinian IT sector grew from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in 2010.[60] The industry has seen a 64% increase in foreign business since 2009. The majority of Palestinian IT companies are concerted in the city of Ramallah north of Jerusalem.[61][62]
Tourism[edit]
Main article: Tourism in the Palestinian territories
In 2010, 4.6 million people visited the Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6 million in 2009. Of that number, 2.2 million were foreign tourists while 2.7 million were domestic.[63] This number of international visits is misleading, however, since most tourists come for only a few hours or as part of a day trip itinerary. In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the United States and Canada.[64] Major travel guides write recently that "the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the effort is richly rewarded."[65]
The Palestinian Authority and Israeli tourism ministries have attempted to work together on tourism in the Palestinian territories in a Joint Committee.[66] Recent cooperation to share access to foreign tourists has not proven successful in Palestine for many reasons relating to the occupation.[67] Israel controls the movement of tourists into the West Bank.[68] Foreign tourism is presently restricted to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, following the August 2013 indefinite closing of the Rafah crossing located between Egypt and the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip.[69] There is essentially no tourist flow to Gaza since 2005 because of the ongoing Israeli military land, air, and sea blockade.
In 2013 Palestinian Authority Tourism minister Rula Ma'ay'a stated that her government aims to encourage international visits to Palestine, but the occupation is the main factor preventing the tourism sector from becoming a major income source to Palestinians.[70] There are no visa conditions imposed on foreign nationals other than those imposed by the visa policy of Israel. Access to Jerusalem and the West Bank is controlled by the Government of Israel and access to Gaza is controlled by Hamas.Entry to the occupied Palestinian territories requires only a valid international passport but entry to Israel may be denied for Palestinians or Arabic visitors
Foreign aid[edit]
In 2008, the West Bank and Gaza economies were heavily reliant on foreign aid which stood at 1.8 billion[clarification needed]. Approximately 30% of the GDP, or US$487 per Palestinian per year came from aid. Foreign aid provided essential services for nearly half of the Palestinian people, and allowed the Palestinian Authority to operate and pay its estimated 140,000 employees.[71]
In 2010, Arab states cut financial aid to the Palestinian Authority. According to the Palestinian Finance Ministry, the PA received $583.5 million in budget support by August 2010, of which only 22 percent came from Arab states. The remainder was from international donors, including the European Union and the United States. Salah Rafat, a member of the PLO Executive Committee, urged the Arab countries to honor their financial pledges.[72]
In April 2011, Salam Fayyad met with Western donors in Brussels and requested $5 billion in aid.[35]
As part of the US Government's attempt to create a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, US Secretary of State John Kerry unveiled a $4 billion plan that would help grow the Palestinian economy by 50 percent and bring "unprecedented wealth to the region".[73] The plan was coordinated in conjunction with former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair. However, the following day after Kerry announced his initiative, the Palestinian Authority rejected the deal saying it won't "make political compromises for financial benefits."[73] The Palestinian Authority's Economic Advisor, Mohammad Mustafa, said "PA's priorities are not economic, but rather a political framework for the creation of Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, that also ensures the rights of refugees and a political compromise, the Palestinian news agency added."[73]
According to Jonathan Cook, Israeli economist Shir Hever has estimated (2016) that at a minimum 78% of foreign humanitarian aid to Palestine finishes up in Israeli coffers. He draws the implication that foreign donor countries are thereby financing Israel's occupation.[74] In return Palestinians receive the equivalent amount in food, goods and services from Israel which is used to improve the standard of living of Palestinians.
Israeli–Palestinian relations[edit]

Commerce[edit]
Joint economic cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians officials has experienced growth over the past years. Starting in 2008, Cisco Systems began a concerted effort to jump-start the nascent Palestinian IT sector with a holistic ecosystem approach, encompassing venture capital, private equity, capacity building and direct outsourcing to Palestinian companies. The company invested $15 million toward that end and drew in other major international investors and donors, including Microsoft, HP and Google. The Palestinian IT sector has since grown from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in 2010.[75]
Olives of Peace is a joint Israeli–Palestinian business venture to sell olive oil. Through this project, Israelis and Palestinians have carried out joint training sessions and planning.[76] The oil is sold under the brand name "Olives of Peace."[77]
In October 2009, a new project got underway promoting tourism and travel between the two areas. New business efforts and tourist attractions have been initiated in Jenin.[78] The two regions are planning a joint industrial zone which would bridge the border. Palestinians would produce locally-made handicrafts and sell them through Gilboa to other regions of the world. Another possible project is a joint language center, where Israelis and Palestinians would teach each other Arabic and Hebrew, as well as aspects of their cultural heritage.[79]
Since 2010, Israeli high-tech companies have begun to employ Palestinian engineers. To date, most of them are outsourced workers, but Mellanox, a computer hardware firm, plans to hire 15–20 Palestinian engineers as regular employees.[80]
In 2011, bilateral trade between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled areas reached $4.3 billion, with Israeli exports to the PA amounting to $3.5 billion and Palestinian exports to Israel amounting to $816 million. According to Nader Tamimi, chair of the Association of Traditional Industries in the PA, there are regular interactions between Palestinian and Israeli businessmen.[81]
At a conference hosted by the Faculty of Business and Management at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 2012, Israeli and Palestinian trade experts met to discuss ways of promoting cross-border business interactions.[81]
In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian Authority were valued at US$20 billion annually.[27] The continuously increasing transactions led to the creation of the joint Palestinian and Israeli initiative, the Jerusalem Arbitration Center (JAC). The center will specialize as an independent institution focusing on business arbitration between Israelis and Palestinians.[27][82]
Conflict[edit]

In 2006, the unity of the Palestinian economy was threatened when Israeli ties to the West bank were severed. The following war in 2008–2009 destroyed all economic infrastructure in Gaza, leaving the Palestinian economy without any remaining activity and owing $1.4 billion.[83] The Oslo Accords in 1993 aimed to prevent this, but was unable to keep the Palestinian economy from fluctuating. Currently, the Palestinian economy lives on foreign aid and customs revenue between Israel and Palestine. However, Israeli restrictions fragmented the Palestinian economy and caused and increase in unemployment.[83] By 2008, 71% of the Gaza Strip's population was unemployed.[83] The import and export prosperity in Palestine was impacted by the border restrictions and constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza, which also weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors.[84] In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed.[54] In the West Bank, the Israeli restrictions caused the Palestinian economy to lose $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP), according to The Guardian and a report for World Bank.[85]

The Palestinian Telecommunications Sector Assessment Note assesses the performance of the telecommunications sector in the Palestinian territories, identifies specific issues, and makes recommendations for further development and reform.  The note specifically discusses the evolution of the issues and of the telecom market.  The note focuses on telecommunications infrastructure, touching upon broadcasting (radio and television) issues, to the extent necessary to discuss radio-magnetic spectrum and other infrastructure related matters.  The first section deals with the assessment of the telecommunications sector, in terms of physical indicators, infrastructure, investment, prices and services. The Palestinian sector is assessed both in historical perspective, and in relation with regional and global benchmarks. A second section of the report illustrates the main issues identified by the stakeholders. Finally, the last section of the report proposes key recommendations for further sector development.

Telecommunication Sector Note in the
 Palestinian Territories: Missed Opportunity for
 Economic Development 
Note for the Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications and InformationTechnology

1 Executive summary
The Telecommunications Sector Assessment Note in the Palestinian territories is a knowledge product prepared by the World Bank in response to a specific request from the Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT) to assess the performance of the telecommunications sector, identify specific issues and make recommendations for further development and reform.
MAIN FINDINGS
The Oslo framework, the reference agreement between the Israeli and Palestinian counterparts to support economic development and stability in key economic sectors, has failed to deliver its promise of an independent telecommunications sector in the Palestinian territories. According to the principles of the Oslo Agreement, "Israel recognizes that the Palestinian side has the right to build and operate separate and independent communication systems and infrastructures including telecommunication networks, a television network and a radio network." Several resolutions of the International Telecommunications Union1 confirm the right of the Palestinian people to have access to an independent telecommunications network.
The principles of the Oslo agreement with respect to the telecom sector remain valid. However, its provisions are not applied. This is presenting enormous challenges for Palestinian telecom operators, a clear detriment to the Palestinian consumer, a fiscal loss for the Palestinian Authority, and an overall delay for sector development. The Joint Technical Committee (JTC) under Oslo, intended to be a regular, technical (non-political) platform to address bilateral issues, has shown inadequate and ineffective performance, and progress since 2008 on bilateral issues has been limited:
• The lack of spectrum is a significant constraint to the development of the industry; in late November 2015, an agreement for a limited release of frequencies to Palestinian operators to launch 3G services has been signed. If implemented, the agreement would finally allow Palestinian operators to introduce mobile broadband using 3G, about eight years after their initial request. The agreement would still place the Palestinian operators at a competitive disadvantage, as Israeli operators have 3G and 4G capabilities and are able to attract higher value customers. As the MENA region is moving towards 4G, the recent agreement on the release of frequencies can hardly be celebrated as a success— although it does represent a first step forward. Combined with other restrictions, the delay in mobile broadband negatively affects Internet development.
• The second mobile operator (Wataniya) cannot fully play its competitive role for the mobile market. Its operations in the West Bank suffered a two-year delay due to Israeli restrictions on releasing the spectrum. The situation for Gaza consumers is worse as Wataniya still cannot start its operations due to restrictions on accessing spectrum and importing civil material2.
• The presence of widespread, unauthorized activity by Israeli operators in the West Bank with mobile broadband capabilities (Israeli operators have 3G capabilities since 2004 and 4G since 2015) has the effect of creating unfair competition at the expense of Palestinian operators which cannot even deliver 3G services. Depending on sources, Israeli operators may currently capture up to 30% of the West Bank market in volume — i.e. number of subscribers. The Israeli market share in value — i.e. measured by the total sales — is even higher as Israeli operators capture high value-added Palestinian customers by providing 3G and 4G.
Other constraints have a negative impact on sector performance, including (i) restrictions on the import of equipment for telecom and ICT companies, (ii) restriction of movement of goods and people within Area C that impedes the deployment and maintenance of infrastructure, and (iii) the requirement by Israel that Palestinian operators go through an Israeli-registered company to access international links.
Some domestic regulatory and competition issues persist, chief among them the strengthening of the regulatory framework with — ideally —the creation of an independent regulatory agency. They still present an important reason in addition to unilateral and bilateral issues for inadequate sector performance. However, some achievements are substantial when compared with other countries in MENA that have yet to introduce similar reforms, and compared to the situation in 2008.
• With the issue of a second mobile license (to operator Wataniya) the authorities have introduced a mobile-focused competitor enjoying de jure rights on equal footing with incumbent operator Paltel. Paltel and Wataniya are robust companies, with deep know-how in the sector, technology proficiency, excellent commercial skills and solid investors. These companies are essential assets for the economic development of the Palestinian territories. If unilateral and bilateral constraints are alleviated, chief among them the release by Israeli operators of spectrum for 3G and 4G and the lifting of Israeli restrictions on the import of equipment for Wataniya in Gaza, they could make a substantial contribution to the development of the Palestinian Territories.
• The Palestinian authorities allow facilities-based ISPs, wherein a local ISP can acquire a broadband license and become a broadband operator. As a result, local entrepreneurs can acquire rights and directly invest in the development of broadband infrastructure at access level. This has been a factor of success for the development of broadband in other emerging regions, especially in Eastern Europe. Few countries in MENA have adopted this liberal approach, which is the norm in Europe and other regions. This achievement is noteworthy.
• Palestinian ISPs with a broadband license can use alternative infrastructure built by non-telecommunications operators, in accordance to the law and relevant regulations. For example, the fiber optics infrastructure of JDECO, a Jerusalem utility company, is used by at least one ISP. JDECO may be willing to lease infrastructure to other operators.
• MTIT has also introduced competition in the VolP and WiFi markets by introducing new licenses.
For the introduction of competition through the award of mobile and broadband licenses to be successful for the Palestinian territories, the overall domestic regulatory framework needs to be strengthened. Despite the achievements mentioned above, there is still the critical need to issue regulations to tackle the dominant position of Paltel in selected segments, and of unauthorized Israeli operators. There is an active and pressing debate on the need of a new law, and on the introduction of an independent regulator. The introduction of an independent regulatory authority reflects good international practice and should be considered as a priority.
Regardless of the timing of the creation of an independent regulator, however, the regulatory framework is lacking a minimum regulatory package of key regulations that support competition in in advanced markets. For example, the regulatory framework should be strengthened through a package of regulations to address dominance and potential anti-competitive risks such as (i) limited access to essential infrastructures in the fixed broadband market, (ii) on-net / off-net price differentiation in the mobile market, and (iii) fixed and mobile cross-subsidizing.
There are specific, additional issues of regulatory and institutional uncertainty in Gaza, preventing the development of the telecom sector:
• Any company applying for a telecom license in the West Bank must go again through a whole new licensing process in Gaza. This generates inefficiencies and costs.
• Several counterparts mentioned that Gaza authorities are levying tax on telecom companies. While the principle of taxing telecom companies can be legitimate, any fiscal revenues should be managed directly by the PA or by a dedicated fund such as a Universal Service Access fund.
• MTIT does not have control over the Palestinian National Internet Naming Authority (PNINA) —and more specifically over the PNINA servers — which is located in Gaza is the official domain registry for the Palestinian country code Top-Level-Domain (".ps"). While the absence of MTIT control over PNINA does not currently prevent Palestinian companies to register and operate a website, MTIT should have control over this Authority.
The impact of unilateral and bilateral issues as well as domestic issues on the performance of the telecommunications sector is compelling:
• The price of fixed and mobile services is still high, and mobile data is particularly expensive, especially compared with the offers of unauthorized Israeli operators.
• A high-level, possibly conservative estimation of the foregone value due to lasting effects of unilateral and bilateral issues as well as domestic issues is provided based on a benchmarking with peer markets. The total revenue loss for the Palestinian mobile sector during the last three years (2013-2015) ranges from US$ 436 to 1,150 million. The revenue loss directly attributable to the absence of 3G is between US$ 339 and 742 million and the total 2013-2015 Value Added Tax fiscal loss for the Palestinian Authority is between US$ 70 and US$ 184 million3. The direct impact represents up to 3.0% of the GDP over the last three years.

In short, compared to the 2008 situation assessed in the World Bank Telecommunications Sector Note (World Bank, 2008), there has been very limited progress on the bilateral side and noticeable progress on the domestic side. On the bilateral side, spectrum issues emerged as the most important bottleneck for the sector, in the context of an industry that has strongly evolved towards the use of radio resources for data communications. The creation of an independent regulator remains the most important domestic priority, but in some areas (sector liberalization, liberal licensing regime), the authorities have taken positive steps that most countries in the region have still to embrace. Most of the issues identified in the current Note were already mentioned one way or another in 2008, and a high-level assessment of the progress achieved during the last 7 years is provided in the table below.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON BILATERAL ISSUES
Revive the JTC platform to address bilateral issues. Specific areas of focus include a comprehensive and long-term agreement on spectrum, beyond the current agreement on 3G, and including 4G spectrum as well as spectrum for network backhauling and other wireless broadband access technologies, ensuring the Palestinian operators the right to develop independent, facilities-based, networks, and, if they wish, accessing shared passive infrastructure facilities.
Review the mechanisms for the functioning of the JTC to ensure greater trust, efficiency and openness. Some suggestions to explore include:
• A commitment to meet on a scheduled and regular basis whatever the political context on both sides;
• The inclusion of a trusted and independent third party with legal and technical expertise to review requests and proposals from both side and provide suggestions where relevant;
• The commitment to i) not disclose sensitive or preliminary proposal and information; ii) and conversely to publish public reports and updates on the work and progress of the JTC.
Release 3G and 4G spectrum. Competition in the mobile market has been the driver of mobile market growth and innovation in all markets, including in distressed, post conflict environments, and releasing additional spectrum would provide benefits to Palestinian residential and corporate end-users. Leaving a mobile-monopoly market structure in Gaza is unhealthy for competition and Gaza consumers. The absence of 3G/4G spectrum assigned to Palestinian operators is also hurting Palestinian consumers. The Israeli authorities have provided a proposal to allocate dedicated spectrum to the Palestinian operators, as well as spectrumon a shared principle on the 2100MHz band. A full allocation of spectrum resources, beyond the 3G spectrum, should be negotiated.
Lift Israeli constraints on the layout of microwave links and the import of civil and telecom material —particularly in Gaza. Some options include:
• Streamlining the administrative procedure for security clearance with stable, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria to be fulfilled;
• Palestinian telecom and ICT companies providing all the needed clearance forms and proofs;
• Israeli authorities monitoring the use of civil and telecom material— particularly in Gaza — with the possible involvement of a trusted third-party performing a detailed audit on a regular basis to ensure all security concerns are dealt with.
Mitigate the effect of unauthorized telecom activity. The issue of unauthorized Israeli telecom activity in the West Bank has been present through the implementation of the Oslo agreement. Two measures can address this issue:
• Palestinian operators should be able to access similar resources as Israeli operators, in order to be on the same competition ground. This includes accessing sufficient spectrum to deploy independent 3G and 4G/LTE systems (which can be shared with Israeli operators on a voluntary basis); this is a top priority for action;
• An ideal cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian authorities would limit the coverage of Israeli operators in the West Bank. This includes the review of telecom equipment deployed (e.g. micro-cells with a smaller coverage radius can limit the coverage compared to macro-cells)4. However, the track record (especially of the JTC) suggests skepticism as to the reach of a solution to limit coverage.
RECOMMENDATIONS ON DOMESTIC REGULATORY AND COMPETITION ISSUES
Create an independent regulator. The creation of an independent regulator (PTRA) is the top domestic priority, with the setting up of a regulatory framework in line with international best practices. The regulatory framework shall ensure an objective, transparent and non-discriminatory approach with the industry, supported by openness and public consultations.
Implement the telecom law. The Note also urges that Palestinian counterparts to implement the existing law without delay, or introduce amendments to ensure it is consistent with global best practices.
Resolve several legal and institutional issues affecting the sector with a minimum regulatory package, including:
• The monitoring of the market with the institution of an ICT observatory.
• The introduction and enhancement of regulatory tools such as market observatory, market definition, identification of Significant Market Power (SMP), remedies definition and enforcements, monitoring and sanctions;
• The enforcement of Reference Interconnection Offers (RIOs) to provide a more dynamic, transparent non-discriminatory and cost oriented wholesale market;
• The assistance in the setting-up of an ex post competition department or authority (to complement the ex ante regulatory approach) to monitor and approve potential mergers and prevent potential anti-competitive behaviors.
Enhance capacity and skills. The legitimacy and efficiency of MTIT and the to-be-created PTRA must be supported by the continuing recruitment of skilled workers to keep up with market developments and complex regulatory tools. This remains a challenge as the labor market is small and the salaries in the public sector are lower than in the private sector.

2 This has also impacted Wataniya's business plan which has an open claim against the Palestinian Authority, asking for part of its license proceeds to be waived given the limited deployment of its operations compared to the rights under its license.
3 Additional fiscal revenues are not estimated in this Note such as corporate taxes.
4 Although the economic impact is marginal, Palestinian operators should also limit their signal reach within Israeli territory.
