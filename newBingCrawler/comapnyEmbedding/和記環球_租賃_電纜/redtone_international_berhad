Mothers En Vogue
		Founded in 2003, Mothers en Vogue® (MEV) was born out of a conviction that nursing mothers and mothers-to-be deserve clothing which is not only fashionable but must combine the multi-features of :

comfort 
 natural and/or eco-friendly fabrication
 innovative nursing construction and, of course,
quality sewing

Beyond being fashionable and trendy, MEV's clothing must deliver equally on comfort. It must also be constructed with natural fabrication (think cotton, linen, bamboo - naturally derived yarns) and even better if ecologically derived. As a brand that embraces breastfeeding, the rationale behind such demands is simple - nursing mothers and babies benefit most from wearing natural textiles as these are most comfortable and breathe-able which in turn, reduce incidences of skin sensitivities or reaction.  

The MEV concept caters not only to a motherâ€˜s clothing and support needs from pregnancy to breastfeeding, but also the clothing needs of her newborn.  Mom's clothing range offers extensive options for nursing and Xtended® use (maternity wear that is also designed for nursing and post-delivery). The newborn and toddler ranges of clothing showcase creative onesies, baby tees and textile-based baby accessories.     

Today, MEV is a leading specialist in breastfeeding and maternity lifestyle fashion in Singapore. MEV is also internationally distributed including the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and Australia through more than 100 stockists, worldwide   MEV stores are now in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Cambodia, with plans to grow the retail network to rest of Asia and beyond.
