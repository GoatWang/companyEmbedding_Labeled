Company Profile

    
      Active Development Pursuing Excellence at Welldone
With the surging development of the telecommunications and communications industries in the 21st century,  
Welldone possesses a positive power of action as it ventures into the fields of mobile power sources and  
telecommunications value-added services. With the concerted efforts of all colleagues, Welldone has already  
built a foundation stone in the industry. In 2002 the company completed the OTC process, and revenues and 
profits have both displayed stable development. In terms of product technology, construction, and market  
competitiveness, Welldone possesses a complete competitive advantage. 

When it was first founded, Welldone was mainly an import-export trading company. In 1986, it won primary  
battery dealership rights from Toshiba, Japan, to represent that company’s batteries. In 1992 it formally  
became the exclusive agent for Toshiba batteries in the Taiwanese market. Then, in 2002, Welldone invested 
 in the related enterprise “Techcharm in Shanghai Ltd. Co.,” whose sole responsibility is sales integration  
in the retail market. Based on our understanding of the battery market,  

Welldone has set up an Electric Power Division, which ventures into the field of mobile phone battery pack  
packing. In addition to the Taipei factory, Techcharm in Shanghai has been set up as a subsidiary company,  
in order to enlarge production capacity and offer even more complete OEM and ODM manufacturing services  
to major mobile phone manufacturers and distributors.  

  Following the arrival and surging development of Taiwan’s communications age, in order to expand services in Welldone’s niche market, we have set up a Telecommunications Division and have received two  
telecommunications certifications. Our objectives are to sell value-added communications products,  
telecommunication voice mail services, and platforms for cross-straits discount telephone calls and Internet  
transactions, etc. Welldone is looking forward to becoming a little giant in the telecommunications field in the  
“two coasts and three regions”—in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. 

 With continuous innovation, Welldone pursues excellence. Our company is committed to professionalism,  
responsibility, service, and innovation, and Welldone will use its competitive advantage flexibly to enlarge and  
develop its business territory.  

We are headed towards the objective of becoming more international and professional, and in the  
communications industry of the 21st century we seek to perceive trends and grasp opportunities before our  
competitors.

The Company


Hungarian company Well Done Kft. is a firm with substantial experience and a long history, which manufactures household detergents and intermediates for keeping your home clean. The factory was established in the city of Komárom in 1996, with the foundations of the know-how and experience of the Well Done detergent company that operates all over the world.
 
The notion behind establishing the company was based on the fact that – respecting consumers needs – only truly good products have the right to appear on the market, therefore Well Done Kft. only manufactures and markets products that meet this requirement.
 
Our company’s many loyal customers know that our product’s are of excellent quality, and that the Well Done logo serves as a guarantee for the outstanding products of a reliable and vastly experienced company both in Hungary, and in numerous other places around the world.
 
Our company determines the price of its products to make them affordable to anyone, so our customers know that Well Done products are ones whose effectiveness is outstanding, are available at acceptable, competitive prices and represent good value for money. To put it simply, they are products for conscientious buyers, who consider not just the importance of price, but also the quality of the product they receive for a given amount of money.
 
Our products are present in 2 main segments of the detergent market. Our retail products may be found in several of Hungary’s well known commercial chains; while our gastro and large size products are available to hospitality operators and institutions through our distributors.
 
The reputation and quality of our products also attracts merchants from neighbouring countries such as Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Austria, as well as Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
 
Our company believes that a truly good detergent produces its cleaning effect without manual scrubbing. This is why Well Done products are concentrated, highly effective products, thereby performing the brunt of cleaning jobs instead of people’s arms.
 
Let us take this opportunity to invite you to use our company’s products. We hope that you will also join the ranks of our loyal and satisfied customers after using Well Done products for the first time.
