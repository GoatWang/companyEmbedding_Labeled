29/09/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 06/10/2016 20:38
Telefónica launches Open Cloud and Cloud Server in Brazil, México and Chile to boost cloud services









Open Cloud is Telefónica's OpenStack-based public cloud proposal, with pay-per-minute-of-usage billing and cutting-edge services like Bare Metal physical servers or advanced database functionality.




Cloud Server is Telefónica's proposal to cover the basic IT needs of its Small & Medium Enterprise customers.



Madrid, 29th of September 2016.Telefónica Business Solutions, a leading provider of a wide range of comprehensive communication solutions for the B2B market, and Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology (ICT) solution provider, have launched the Open Cloud and Cloud Server services in Chile, Brazil and Mexico. This launch is carried out in the context of the comprehensive partnership agreement established between the two companies to drive the migration of customers' traditional IT services to the cloud.
      

Open Cloud is a public cloud service based on OpenStack technology and hosted in Telefónica's data centers in Chile, Brazil and Mexico. The service represents Telefónica's commitment to an open and secure cloud and provides a broad range of services ranging from computing, storage, networks and databases to more advanced application development, security and analysis services. One of the main advantages of Open Cloud is the ability to connect to customers' private networks, as well as the connectivity to additional Telefónica's data center services. All of this enables customers to have hybrid cloud environments in a fast and easy manner in accordance with countries' local laws and regulations.
      

        Similarly, Telefónica's Cloud Server service, is already commercially available in Brazil, Chile and Mexico, running on Huawei's platform. Cloud Server makes possible to deploy a cloud server quickly and easily without much technical knowledge. This enables companies to focus on their business and delegate the management of infrastructure to Telefónica. Cloud Server is Telefónica's proposal to cover the basic IT needs of customers in the small and medium enterprise sector.
      

        Telefónica Business Solutions and Huawei continue to work together under the existing global partnership agreement established between the two companies. The next countries in which these services will be launched are Peru, Argentina, as well in the USA to support Telefónica's international customers operating in that market.  
      

        José Luis Gamo, B2B Products & Solutions Director at Telefónica Business Solutions, said: 'The launch in record time of the Open Cloud and Cloud Server services in Chile, Mexico and Brazil is a huge joint milestone for Telefónica and Huawei. A strategic technology partner for Telefónica that enables us to provide a better Cloud solution in the market with the best features at the best price and with the latest technology. With this release, which represents Telefónica's commitment to an open and secure cloud, we are moving towards our goal of providing the best products for Cloud services, while driving our customers' digital transformation.'
      

        Yelai Zheng, President of Huawei IT Product Line, said: 'We are honored to have the global cloud strategic partnership with Telefónica, the strategic alliance aims at delivering advanced public cloud services for all Telefónica enterprise customers. By combining Huawei 's long-term and sustained investment in global information and communications technology, with Telefónica's leading B2B market development capabilities, both companies aim to transform the traditional industries by providing high-quality, innovative, and industry-oriented cloud services, to enterprises and SME customers. Cloud is a key strategic new business for Huawei, and we are committed to grow more and more our investment in this area. Working together, Telefónica and Huawei can build key differentiators to succeed in the market.'

Telefonica Brasil UnderperformsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Telefonica Brasil Underperforms Zacks Equity Research ZacksMay 14, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareBrazilian telecom carrier Telefonica Brasil SA (VIV) reported first quarter 2012 net income of R$956.6 million ($541.2 million), down 15.2% year over year. Earnings per ADS came in at 48 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents.Revenue grew 3.7% year over year to R$8.31 billion ($4.7 billion). The outperformance was primarily driven by growth in mobile revenue.Consolidated EBITDA inched up 0.3% year over year to R$2.85 billion ($1.61 billion) with EBITDA margin decreasing 120 basis points (bps) to 34.2%. Operating expenses grew 5.6% to R$5.47 billion ($3.09 billion) from the year-ago quarter.Revenue SegmentsMobile revenue climbed 9.3% year over year to R$5.11 billion ($2.89 billion), driven primarily by data and VAS, and access and usage revenues. Telefonica Brasil added 3.23 million customers to reach 74.78 million (up 20.5% year over year) subscribers at the end of the first quarter. Post-paid and prepaid subscribers grew 24.8% and 19.3% year over year to 16.62 million and 58.16 million, respectively.Average revenue per user (:ARPU) fell 5.9% to R$22.4 ($12.7) as lower voice ARPU outstripped the strong growth in data ARPU. Churn deteriorated 20 bps year over year to 2.5%.Fixed revenue fell 4.1% to R$3.21 billion ($1.81 billion) year over year. Fixed voice and access revenue, which saw the largest decline of 14.6%, offset solid growth in interconnection (up 1.6%), Pay TV (up 45.4%), data transmission (up 10.5%) and other services revenues (up 17.7%).Total fixed access lines reached 15.25 million at the end of the reported quarter, reflecting a 1.3% year-over-year increase. Telefonica Brasil registered 54,000 net additions for its fixed broadband service, bringing the total subscriber base to roughly 3.68 million (up 9.1% year over year). The Pay TV subscriber base shot up 34.2% year over year to 683,000 customers. Fixed voice lost 292,000 customers from the year-ago quarter, touching 10.88 million at the end of the first quarter.LiquidityTelefonica Brasil, a subsidiary of Telefonica SA (TEF), exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of R$3.18 billion compared with R$4.25 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net debt decreased to R$2.66 billion from R$3.16 billion in 2011. Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.22 times compared with 0.26 times in 2011.Capital expenditure increased 63.4% year over year to R$1.16 billion ($0.66 billion) in the reported quarter.Our TakeTelefonica Brasil has attractive long-term opportunities in mobile business thanks to continued expansion of the subscriber base. We believe the fixed-line business, which is currently lagging, will also benefit from the expansion of video, broadband Internet and Pay TV services. However, we remain skeptical about its ability to regain profitability this year.Further,the synergies derived from the mobile business would be partly offset by intense inflationary pressure, stiff competition from its rivals such as America Movil S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX) and Telecom Italia S.P.A. (TI) and excessive government intervention.We are currently maintaining our long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock. For the short term (1-3 months), Telefonica Brasil holds a Zacks # 3 (Hold) Rank.Read the Full Research Report on TEFRead the Full Research Report on AMX Read the Full Research Report on VIV Read the Full Research Report on TI Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read the analyst report on TEF,AMX,VIV,TIReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityThe Obamas Send Newlywed Couple a Moving Note of Congratulations7,570 reactions6%67%27%Start Living The Millionaire LifestyleTorOptionSponsoredFire breaks out at world's largest fish market in Tokyo61 reactions1%94%5%Trump, frustrated by Afghan war, suggests firing U.S. commander: officials6,717 reactions4%72%24%63,000 people have canceled their Tesla Model 3 orders586 reactions4%78%18%If you own a computer you must try this game!Throne: Kingdom At WarSponsoredElephant Parade hits the streets of São Paulo24 reactions5%74%21%Huckabee Sanders takes a dig at Sen.
