I've been using Flexiroam for a few months now and in several countries around the world. This is the best roaming product I've ever used. Works every time without a glitch and it simplified my travel experience enormously!

I've been using Flexiroam X for my entire month-long trip in Europe, across 5 countries and the service has been seamlessly impressive. I'll never go back to not using this when I travel. It's just so easy, affordable, and saved me hours trying to get a new SIM in each new city.

I used the Flexiroam SIM on the weekend as I was travelling to an area in Victoria with little or no reception for Vodafone users. Over the long weekend I often switched to the Flexiroam X to gain access to mobile data (Twitter, sporting apps, internet etc). I found your product to be very useful and have recommended the app to a number of family & friends.

I traveled to USA, Indonesia and now in Korea the past month, all seamlessly switching on and off on Flexiroam X international data roaming, across multiple local networks.  The US$30 for a small 1GB in 100 plus countries is worth it as opposed to buying multiple SIMs but waste unused data. Ideal for frequent multicountry travelers on a budget.

Affordable international data roaming is no longer a pipe dream for Americans, thanks to Southeast Asian based telecommunications startup Flexiroam. Their flagship product, Flexiroam X, was launched in 2016 and consists of an ultra-thin microchip that can be applied onto users` pre-existing SIM card and subsequently activated through a mobile app. It allows users to enjoy borderless data in over 100 countries, without ever having to change their SIM card. Flexiroam`s roaming service provides one of the best balances between price and convenience compared to other roaming solutions in the market.
Flexiroam X is already making waves in the Asian market, with over 130,000 subscribers as of June 2017. Flexiroam has just signed a partnership deal with Bluwire Group LLC, the leading retailer of technology products in international airports throughout the United States. Flexiroam X will be sold in 14 airport stores, spread across 7 international airports located in New York, Newark, Houston, Dulles, Denver, Minneapolis and Atlanta. This partnership will see Flexiroam X becoming accessible to over 350 million people traveling through these airports, helping Flexiroam break into the US market. Flexiroam X will also be exclusively sold, making it the only data product sold in these retail stores.
Jef Ong, the Managing Director of Flexiroam, added "This is a landmark partnership for Flexiroam, as it provides our product access into the US market through some of the busiest airports in America. Frequent travellers would get to enjoy affordable, borderless connectivity without having to worry about changing SIM cards. Through this added visibility in American airports, we anticipate sales of Flexiroam X to increase in North America and our partners such as Bluwire benefiting from being early movers in this space."(c)  2017 South Sudan News Agency.
