          Telekom Slovenije's television services are increasingly becoming the central hub of Slovenian households. Telekom Slovenije has recently made it possible for its television service subscribers to take advantage of the promotions for the purchase of devices and using services through their TV sets, namely the BOX set-top box. This option is available to Telekom Slovenije's subscribers of television services who do not have an active subscription agreement lock-in, and who can purchase a product or take advantage of a discount to the monthly subscription fee with just a few clicks on the remote. At the moment subscribers can use this method to purchase the PHILIPS 32PHS4001 LED TV, the Lenovo Tab3 7 Essential tablet and the HP 255 G5 (X0P90EA) notebook computer.
        



          "Telekom Slovenije is constantly on the lookout for new user habits and developing services that fit with the latest trends. Television is increasingly becoming the centre of the home. Our subscribers can use their TV sets, i.e. the BOX set-top box, to switch electricity suppliers, and by offering a range of devices and services for purchase with just a few clicks on the remote we have made the next step in this field. On the one hand television is becoming a sales and communication channel, while on the other hand development is heading towards services that will become the centre and the hub of the smart home," says Simon Slonjšak, the head of Advanced Living at Telekom Slovenije.
          Telekom Slovenije's TV subscribers can now choose from the selected range of devices at promotional prices, purchasing them in instalments with zero interest and free delivery, or they can opt to take a discount on their monthly subscription fee. These advantages are available upon concluding a 24-month subscription agreement.
          Subscribers to Telekom Slovenije's TV services are the first and only television subscribers who can order electricity services over their TV set, i.e. BOX set-top box. This way they can change electricity providers in a fast and simple way, switching to the exceptionally deal on electricity from Telekom Slovenije. If they choose to connect their electricity and communication services to a joint invoice, they receive an additional discount.
