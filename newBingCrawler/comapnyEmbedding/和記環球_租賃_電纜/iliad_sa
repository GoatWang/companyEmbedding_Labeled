DID YOU KNOW?

Saline, or simply another word for a salt solution, has been known throughout the ages to have a rehydration effect. Salt is important for maintaining the body’s electrolyte balance, enabling the organs to function properly. For workers outside in the heat or for people who lead active lifestyles, rehydrating the body with salt and water is vital for optimal electrolyte intake. Electrolytes include calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. When used in the nose, a saline solution can help to cleanse and moisturise the nose.
