        15 years ago, Swisscom launched its 'Internet for Schools' initiative: Today, all Swiss schools benefit from free secure Internet access as a result. It guarantees that pupils can use the Internet safely, protected from cybercrime and inappropriate content. However, schools now face new challenges. The Internet is no longer only a means of visual instruction; it is increasingly becoming a work area. Whole teaching modules are only available online. Pupils and teachers also use the net for research, communication and saving documents. A lack of standardisation and alternatives mean that reports and other confidential data are often saved through providers that operate servers in the USA. Swisscom has now taken 'Internet for Schools' to the next level to offer schools everything for secure online teaching, communication and data storage.
      

        Vastly increased speed, digital homework book

        Schools now have free access to speeds of up to 500 Mbit/s or the maximum speed available at any site: by 2021 Swisscom will provide all Swiss communities with fibre-optic technology ensuring that even remote areas have access to ultra-fast broadband.
      

        A free licence for classroom videoconferencing is also included: so pupils in hospital can continue to follow lessons via Skype, for instance. It also lets experts easily join in teaching in the virtual classroom. In many countries, these live insights into practical worlds of experience are already the order of the day, letting practitioners and experts demonstrate the theory taught in class. Swisscom also supplies schools with a free basic version of 'Helloclass' with data storage in Switzerland. Helloclass digitises homework books, weekly timetables and letters to parents, thus creating a secure and very user-friendly platform for communication and planning. So, there is no longer any need for telephone chains, letters announcing deadlines or sending timetables. Information is always accessible and cannot be lost. Today, Helloclass is already used in more than 1,500 classes. In addition, Swisscom offers schools a discount-price cloud for data storage in Switzerland - for certificates, school reports or tests, for instance. As Michael In Albon, Head of 'Internet for Schools' and media skills expert explains: 'Information technology doesn't tend to be a subject in its own right nowadays; is simply part of teaching - just as IT is a natural part of our working lives now. 'This is a radical change and sooner or later pupils will end up only working with tablets or notebooks. This, in turn, requires very different capacities which we provide to schools for free. 'Many farther-reaching solutions are intended mainly for school administrations, whom we have long supported in their journey into the digital future,' says Michael In Albon. 'We have now standardised solutions for the most common demands, making them less expensive, easier and more readily available.'
      

        Support for schools continues

        In addition to supporting schools with technology, Swisscom also constantly updates its 'Medienstark' media skills initiative, which provides training for teachers and parents as well as pupils. As of this year, it is also possible to book a version compatible with Curriculum 21, which fits in with new structural requirements. Michael In Albon: 'Computers, smartphones, digital technologies - they have all completely changed our daily lives over the past 20 years. And so it's only logical and necessary that schools change, too. We hope that our contribution will help make implementing change smooth, secure and straightforward.' The services provided over the past 15 years are worth a total of half a billion Swiss francs in monetary terms. In the future, schools will continue to enjoy free services worth around CHF 30 million annually.

The competition is heating up for Swisscom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SCMWY) as the second -largest wireless provider, Sunrise Communications AG is all set to launch in the public market. It will the Swiss stock exchange’s giant initial public offering in last eight years as Sunrise intends to raise $1.3 billion in order to cut debt.
What does the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) say about future trends with SCMWY?
Intense Competition
Other than the debt settlement, Sunrise could utilize part of the proceeds for growth as well, according to CEO Libor Voncina. Subsequent to the IPO, Sunrise’s major private-equity based stakeholder, CVC Capital Partners, will slash down its stake. CVC currently holds 90% stake in the company.
With the lauch of the IPO, Sunrise aims to compete with rivals like Swisscom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SCMWY), which have led to price wards in the region. Swisscom AG offers it subscribers mobile subscription service at a flat rate starting from 59 francs to 169 francs per month. Meanwhile, billionare Xaview Niel has also entered in a deal to buy third ranked carrier, Orange Switzerland for 2.8 billion francs last month. Neil is already known to give rise to a price war in France and his deal may mean same in Switzerland as well.
 Timing Is Right
In view of growing competition, Sunrise finds its ideal of raising funds timed right as it will complement its investments in product line, network and customer service improvement. However, Voncina denied that the decision of launching an IPO was due to Orange deal. Following the Orange deal, a Bloomberg report cited a person familiar with the matter that Neil may pursue opportunities to merge Orange with Sunrise in order to compete with Swisscom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SCMWY).
Sunrise posted sales worth 2 billion francs and earnings of 621 million francs for the year through September 2014. The company forecasts that its adjusted EBITDA and sales for the year 2014 should be up by 2-3%, while the operating margin should increase by 33%. Swisscom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SCMWY) shares closed the previous session 14.81% up at $59.45.
Technicals

Swisscom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SCMWY) rallied hard from mid-2012 to early 2014 to gain over 70% but the area around $60-$62 turned out to be a very trick one as it continuously pushed the price down from that area. The Elliott Wave theory followers would argue that all the price action from the May 2014 top of $61.53 formed a Flat Corrective pattern, which ended at $49.70 last week, giving birth to the next impulse. So until that low is broken on any correction, expect new highs.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Swisscom First Quarter Results 2017. With us today as usual, Urs Schaeppi; Mario Rossi; and Louis Schmid, Louis, the floor is yours.
Louis Schmid
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Swisscom's first quarter results presentation 2017. My name is Louis Schmid, Head of Investor Relations. And with me are our CEO, Urs Schaeppi; and Mario Rossi, our Chief Financial Officer.
The first part of today's analyst and investor presentation hosted our CEO consist of three chapters: a quick overview of Q1 highlights, our market and financial performance, then some explanations on Swisscom Switzerland and finally, an update on Fastweb. In the second part of the presentation, Mario runs you through the financials and the unchanged guidance for the full-year 2017.
With that, I would like to hand over to Urs to start his part of the presentation on Slide 4. Urs?
Urs Schaeppi
Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. If you go to Slide 4, you can see that we have a solid start into the year. So on the branding side we are really the trusted brand in Switzerland. On innovation, we made a lot of innovation. Just as an example, we increased our coverage for 4G plus, and we also launched a new product, which I will come later to it.
We were able to keep our strong and leading position in the retail market, although we have the same dynamics as in the last quarters in the retail markets. Enterprise market, we have a very solid and strong positioning, a bit lighter solution basis in Q1, but overall, a good performance also in the enterprise business.
Fastweb, strong results in the Q1 and if you look to the revenue evolution, you'll see that, overall, we have a flat revenue evolution; I will come later to with some details to it. So overall a good first quarter a solid financial situation. We also confirmed our A ratings, and we have unchanged guidance for 2017.
If you go on Slide 5, you'll see the market performance of Swisscom. Easy said, it's good and solid. We were able to defend our strong market position even in a market which is becoming more and more competitive. If you take as an example our evolution in the broadband business, you see that we have a stable broadband business 2 million connections and the net adds are, let's say, stable or minus 4,000.
And the main reasons behind is that SMEs who are on the cost pressure optimized their broadband connection, that's one. The dynamics there in the market is saturated. And on the other side, we have the CPS migration or All-IP migration. So even in such an environment, we were able to have a stable broadband business and also good KPIs in the broadband business.
I'm optimistic of the performance of broadband in the next quarters because within - one, our new quadruple-play offer, we will gain more momentum, then we have the further rollout of our ultra broadband footprint. And we see that in areas where we have an ultra-broadband footprint, we have better figures, and also our Swisscom TV products is strong and, clearly, [indiscernible]. So I'm optimistic for the future on the development of the broadband. Here you will see that we were able to grow also on mobile postpaid, solid KPIs, a good market performance and a small growth in a saturated market.

On the fixed voice business, you see that the substitution of the fixed lines, which we already saw in the last year is continuing, and we have a loss of 70,000 fixed line connections, and this is substitution that's actually not lost to competition. Fastweb has a good evolution, you see it on the right side of the slide, a good net adds in the first quarter.
The financial performance on Slide 6, if I can begin with the net revenue, you see the net revenue is declining by CHF54 million. But if you go deeper in it, you can see that more than 40% of this decline is driven by one-offs. This is mainly an exchange rate effect. And second, it's hard to a business, there's always a bit of seasonality in it. So the real decline in the service revenue is much lower. And the reason that the service revenue is slightly coming back is the voice line loss and the impact of roaming.
On the right side, you see the EBITDA. Actually, a stable or flat situation in EBITDA compared to the previous year. And if you go deeper into it from Switzerland, you see that the loss on the EBITDA level is CHF16 million, and CHF11 million is coming from roaming, CHF19 million is coming from the loss of fixed lines. And then through cost savings, we could compensate this decline on the service revenue. So as a result, we have this minus CHF16 million EBITDA in Swisscom Switzerland.
If you go on Slide 8, you will see that we have solid market shares, and we will continue to defend these market shares. In mobile, we have 60% broadband. If you change - or if you include also the wholesale market shares, we have 67% market share on that and on TV, a growing market share of 32%.
Slide 9 shows you that we continue to invest in our networks. In Q1, we had 3.6 million households, which are connected with ultra broadband, which have speed above 50 megabits and we have 2.1 million out of which has a speed above 100 megabits per second, so increasing fast, an increasing footprint in our ultra broadband network. In wireless, we're also building out our networks. We have 99% 4G coverage. We have 4G+ coverage, above 40%, and this leads to speeds up to 300 megabits per second. And this shows our leading position in the - also in the mobile market.
On the right side of the chart, just some remarks to CHIP test. The test is the marketing instrument of Switzerland where a lot of competitors do the marketing of a test. We don't see our company on a test, but there are some tests which shows you that - there are a lot of tests where Swisscom is the winner, and it shows that Swisscom has a leading infrastructure and we'll do the necessary things to keep ahead on this infrastructure competition.
If you go on Slide 10, you'll see what we have done to manage our market performance, to differentiate our project portfolio. In 2017, in March, we launched a new offer for Wingo Mobile sales plan, a very competitive offer on the price level for the more price sensitive markets where we have a good starting and also good sales figures. In April, we launched our quadruple-play offer or fixed mobile converged offer. I will come later it, and also a multi-device proposition.
Page 11 shows you the performance, wireless performance in the retail market. So a solid postpaid momentum, ARPU was up, stable churn, stable long churn figures in the postpaid markets and a good momentum on bundling. On the left side of the chart, you see that we have 3.3 million postpaid customers. Out of that, 70% are infinity customers, and 23% are, again, bundles of these postpaid customers.
The ARPU is overall - same with the blended ARPU, more or less stable. Infinity ARPU is slightly going back, some remarks to it. That is due to the mix - due to a mix because infinity is still a bit growing and then lower infinity customers are coming in the clusters, that's the main effects. If I look deep to the infinity customer base, we see a stable ARPU in the infinity customer base. So it's mainly acquisition-driven, mix-driven. So overall, revenue in the mobile market is stable, and we were able to compensate the impact of roaming.

If you go on Slide 12, you see the wireline performance in the retail market. And there, we have a mixed picture, TV, which is growing on a year-on-year level of 115,000. Broadband, we have a growth of 20,000 year-on-year. And then the dynamics or the change which we have already last year is in the voice line business where we have a decline on a yearly level, year-on-year of 256,000. And this is a substitution, mainly substitution and consolidation.
The good news is that the ARPU is stable, and we have also introduced the ticker average revenue per households, which you see here on the bottom line of this figure. I think that the KPI, which is becoming more and more important in a more converged market. Overall, the service revenue is CHF680,000 so minus - the overall minus CHF32 million, and the main effect is the voice line. Bundling is growing, good momentum in the bundling business.
On Page 13, you see the performance in the converged market. So bundles went up by volume by 18% on a year-on-year level. The top line is growing by CHF72 million, so we have a good and strong momentum in the converged business. On the left side of the chart, you see the subscription and the bundling. In Q1, we have 1.7 million bundles, triple-play or fixed mobile converged bundles. And from the mobile revenue generating units, 15% are in this, so it shows that there's still a lot of content to increase the mobile penetration and the bundle.
In the middle of the page, you see that the ARPU of our bundles is slightly going down because also of a mix effect of the new subscription. So if penetration is low, then we get lower charge in it. That's a mix effect and from impacts on growing and then some impacts out of the voice line. These are the main reasons of the ARPU evolution, but overall, growing revenue with bundles.
On Page 14, you see some explanation to our new offers, our new price line, inOne. So the market is becoming more and more converged. We are in a mature market in Switzerland. And we have a market, let's call it, everybody offers everything. So we see this clear trend to a converged market. And also the customer is asking for it. So the customer is asking for more converged offers, is asking for flexibility and value for money.
The strategy of Swisscom in this market is value-oriented approach. We don't want to decrease our prices. Our ambition is to maintain the price levels. And the philosophy behind inOne is more for more. And what we are doing with our new offering, one, we are combining our flagship offers Vivo, that's a [indiscernible] with our Infinity offer, and then it's a bundle discount on the top.
On Slide 15, you see the structure of this new price plan. It's a multilevel concept. And then you can pick out different bundles, let's say, a large bundle on mobile, a medium bundle on the Internet and then also a large bundle on TV, according to your demands or your desires. And if you're bundling even more mobile, you see it on the right side of the chart at the bottom, you see as more mobile you put in, in the bundle, the higher is the monthly benefit you get. With this approach, we will be able to increase our mobile penetration to household.
On Slide 16, you see why we are doing this. We want to defend our leading position in the Swiss markets. We want to get an instrument where we can do upselling and cross-selling and, at the end, we will be able to increase our share of wallet. With the flexibility of the bundles, we will be able to increase the Net Promoter Score and also reduce the churn on the lower end of the market, which is actually already low.
In [summarizing] the last three marks on this slide. If you take the households which have a Swisscom broadband connection, you can see that more than 1 million in these households has the mobile with operators, and this shows actually the potential to increase the penetration of mobile to our inOne offering.

Slide 17 gives you a short overview of our Enterprise business. On the right side, you see that we have a value proposition, which is very strong. So we are really the only fully integrated operator, we have strong ICT capabilities and we can really offer converged ICT offers in a market, which is becoming more cloud-based, and this shows our strong positioning in the B2B market.
The revenue in the B2B market is - was in 2016 approximately CHF2.4 billion. And from this CHF2.4 billion, approximately 45% of the revenue is coming out of the telecommunication business, wireless and wireline. Other 45% is coming out of the solutions business. And there we have different business units. We have vertical solutions as an example for the banking. We have cloud solutions, we have workplace solutions. So it shows a strong solutions portfolio with 45% and with a mid-term potential to grow. And then the last 10% of the revenue is more hardware-driven or others business.
The enterprise developments on Slide 18. You see that we have stable revenue-generating units in the B2B market, which shows our strong performance in the B2B market. We were able to increase the revenue-generating unit in the mobile market despite some aggressive price moves of competitors, and this leads to an overall stable ARPU development. The decline in the voice business is mainly driven through consolidation and IP migration.
The service revenue is overall flat. On a year-on-year base, we lost CHF8 million, so it's more or less flat. It's developed under the service revenue. And the solutions revenue is slightly lighter in Q1, and there are actually two effects. One is we have always some seasonality in the projects business in the B2B market. And on the other side, we have the price pressure last year with some projects in the Workplace and collaboration area, that's why the revenue in Q1 is a bit lower. But mid-term, we have potential to grow in the solutions business.
If you go on Slide 19, actually, the message of this slide is we are on track with our processing, so we will deliver this CHF75 million cost reduction. And there, we have a broad program to increase the efficiency to reduce cost or improve quality.
On Slide 21, some remarks to Fastweb. So we continue to increase our ultra broadband footprint in Italy, and our target is to have in 2020 a footprint of 5 million households with more than 1 gigabit per second speed. We will have a footprint of 8 million households with approximately 200 megabits and 5.5 million with the speed, let's say, between 20 and 200 megabits. So we will have a good ultra broadband footprint, and we are on track with our plans.
Slide 22 shows you our market performance of Fastweb in the broadband business. If you take the market share of the broadband connections, you can see that we were able to increase our market share slightly. And also on the revenue side, we are able to increase our revenue market share in the broadband business. The performance of the net ads in Q1 is good, so we were able to grow also compared to the Q1 in 2016. So overall, a good market momentum of Fastweb.
Slide 23 shows you the wireless performance. We launched successfully our new 4G offer. 9% of the new customers are buying a bundled offer, mobile and wireline. And we see in this converged offer a lower churn by 3% point, so lower churn through a converged offering.
Fastweb corporate performance on Slide 24. So also here, we have an increase in revenue market share in the corporate market and we have also a very strong proposition in the corporate market. And therefore, we are optimistic to have the good development in the corporate market also in the next quarters.
Slide 25 shows the financial performance. Solid performance, 3% more revenue, 11% higher EBITDA and a positive free cash flow. And so we confirm our expectation on the financial development of Fastweb.

So I would like now to hand over to Mario Rossi for the financials. Mario?
Mario Rossi
Thank you, Urs. From my side, a few additional remarks on the financials. You have seen the result in new segment reporting. Switzerland now consists of three segments, that's retail customers, enterprise customers and wholesale network and other. You received the restated numbers one week ago in order to fill you excel sheets and your new models.
I'll start then on Page 27 with some remarks on revenue. In the three spaces, the retail revenue declined by 3.1%, and stand there at CHF1.5 billion for the first quarter. The decline comes mainly from service revenue, there we saw CHF29 million. There we saw a flat development in wireless, even a slight increase of CHF3 million compared to prior year. And we lost CHF32 million on wireline. CHF15 million came from the fixed line loss. Then you have two additional effects, we don't charge anymore for the TV activation fees and [indiscernible] fees.
The bundle discounts, the total effect is booked on wireline. The enterprise business saw reduced revenues by 4.7%, it lands at CHF612 million revenues for the first quarter. The [indiscernible] evolution on service revenue is CHF97 million. 50% comes from fixed, 50% from mobile. And mobile is the impact of the roaming.
And Urs mentioned, we have kind of weak start in the solutions business. Revenue is CHF16 million compared to the prior year. Then especially we had some weak start in the UCC workplace business. As you see, a slow evolution of the PBX business. I think that can be attributed to the all-IP migration as many customers wait for these projects until they get full visibility, what that will mean for their operation.
On the wholesale business, there we have two effects. Less revenues from NTR, an NTR reduction among the mobile operators, CHF15 million. That's compensated by additional income in roaming revenues of about CHF12 million. I think Fastweb, Urs explained that the client saw an increase in the consumer segment, a bit like Q1 in the B2B segment, but that has something to do with seasonality.
On the OpEx on Page 21. On the direct costs, SAC/SRC, there we have three different effects. We have higher box worth CHF11 million. First of all, we changed the model in 2016 related to TV boxes. They're now booked as OpEx that touching the first quarter impact of CHF16 million. Then we have higher subsidies of CHF6 million, and then you have less wireless SAC/SRCs of CHF11 million because we have less retention cases. You remember last year, we had extremely high retention number in Swiss business.
On both goods and purchase, goods purchased had doubled. First, we had lower MTRs and lower international voice termination fees. And then because of the lower hardware revenues, of course, we had also lowered related to the hardware business. On the indirect costs, as Urs mentioned, we are on track to deliver the CHF75 million. You see also in Q1, we are able to reduce the headcount in Switzerland at approximately 150 FTEs.
EBITDA in Switzerland, we lost 1.7% EBITDA. We stayed there at CHF928 million, but we were able to keep the EBITDA margin at a solid 41.3%. I would say approximately 50% of the pressure on topline service revenue were compensated by cost reductions in Swiss business.
Fastweb clearly benefits from the revenue increase and have stable costs. In the cost, we have two effects. One is higher subscriber acquisition cost because we have a higher number of client customers. And second one is we have a change in the regulated prices in the [indiscernible] booked in Q1.
The low EBITDA and EBIT, I think there are two points to mention, lower interest expenses, the standard CHF6 million. We will see further savings in the future, in mid of July, there's a €600 million bond with a coupon of 3.75%, so we are more than confident that we will create some savings on this side.

Then on the tax rate, you see here in Q1 a high tax rate of 25% compared to expected one of 21%. We have two effects in Q1, adjustment of the prior year tax loss in Swiss business of CHF7 million, then you have CHF8 million corrections of prior year assessment for the year 2012 to 2015 allocation of profits to different [indiscernible]. But again, tax rate long-term will remain at 21%.
On Page 31 on CapEx. Only one remark, we had, let's say, low CapEx activity in the FTTx environment in Switzerland, it's just seasonal reasons. We had a very cold January, which created limitations to the construction activities in Switzerland. So we will invest in the fiber area, as expected, around CHF600 million in 2017.
Page 33, on the operating free cash flow. There's nothing special in Q1 in Switzerland. You remember last year, we had this payment of CHF186 million for the ADSL case. This case is still pending. As I said on the call, we don't know when we will be assigned a decision. Net debt at Q1 stands at CHF7.7 billion, which is 5% below prior year.
And finally, coming to the outlook. As mentioned, the outlook is unchanged. So four main drivers for the decrease in the EBITDA level in the Swiss business was line loss, CHF50 million; roaming, CHF70 million; price pressure and other, about CHF50 million, compensated partially by savings of about CHF75 million.
After Q1, I would expect a bit higher impact from the fixed line loss and a bit lower impact from the roaming business. At Fastweb, in Italy, we are confident that we will meet our growth targets on revenue and EBITDA.
And with that, I would like to hand over to Louis for Q&A.
Louis Schmid
The operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, Louis. [Operator Instructions] Simon Coles, Barclays. Your question please.
Simon Coles
Hi. Simon Coles from Barclays. Thank you for taking the question. So the first one, I guess, is on your recent pricing changes. I guess it's a bit early, but just wondering if you could give us any information about how traction is going for your new inOne products and whether you've seen any change in competition, some pricing changes from your competitors.
And secondly, in the enterprise segment, we saw RGUs improve this quarter, but service revenues declined. I guess that's a function of the mix change, but is there also ARPU pressure from competition going on there? We've seen a competitor announced that they clearly want to be better in that part of the market. Thank you very much.
Urs Schaeppi
On our new offer, inOne, it's a bit early to really have a good understanding. But what we see is actually a good take up, and we see a good momentum on mobile. We see that it's going from - but it's too early really to say how the dynamics will be. Because in the beginning you have always build another dynamics in midterm, a bit too early, but we don't see really big deviations to what we planned.
And then on the enterprise market development of the service revenue. Overall, the development in the service revenue in our enterprise space is - it's quite safe. So we were able to grow on the subscription side on mobile. We have the impact on roaming on the mobile and stable development in the fixed business. So what we see is in some customers we see very aggressive moves from our competitors who try to enter the market. But up to now if you've seen the development of our market shares, we are in a good and stable position, but the price aggressiveness is there.
Simon Coles
That's very clear. Thank you very much.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, thanks. I have couple of questions. Staying with inOne propositions, when you launched, you talked about initial pressure on bundled ARPU due to right-grading. However, since then, Sunrise has also launched their quad-play proposition at discount and so could also enter the fixed end market. So what makes you confident that the ARPU pressure will not be that severe, and you will be able to still see upselling at a later stage?

And secondly, at Fastweb, you're having clearly a good success in mobile with 4G launch and bundling services. But at some point, you will also have increasing competition with Iliad coming in mobile. What makes you confident that the converged strategy can still drive growth? And also, can I clarify, what was the EBITDA growth this quarter, excluding the regulatory changes at Fastweb, and there shouldn't be any further regulatory benefit rest of the year? Thank you.
Urs Schaeppi
I will take the question of inOne, and Mario will come down to Fastweb. If you go on our offer on Page 15, you see that the idea of our inOne offer. And with the flexible approach, we are also flexible in matching different price points, because not every customer needs 1 giga. A lot of customers are more than happy with the, let's say, with 30 to 40 megabit per second. So I think with our offer in inOne, our salespeople have the ability to really react on different customers and to offer them an attractive price point. And then with the advantage of mobile, we will be able to really offer an attractive proposition for the household.
And as I mentioned it in our broadband household footprint, more than 1 million mobiles are not with Swisscom. So there is a potential to upsell. And then you have also a potential to upsell if we increase our ultra broadband footprint so we can upsell customers who are achieving for speed. We can upsell them and they get more results from ultra. So I think we have the instruments to react flexible on the mobile market, and it's a bit too early to say how successful the converged offer of Sunrise will be. And I don't see, on our side, a huge impact [indiscernible] and it's too early to say how Salt will launch, the fixed market. But I think we have a solid positioning to defend our market position.
Mario Rossi
And on the Italian business, but first of all we are happy with the move of our customers to the network of Telecom Italia and the ability that it can deliver 4G to our customers. Then with this offer I think we preempt the business mobile offer, we kind of - through kind of preempt and often expect it in the up-mark management, and that's also mentioned in his presentation, if you see that now, already at the very early stage that the 10% of new customers are willing to buy mobile and wireline.
And as we mentioned several times, [indiscernible] might be very fast in delivering mobile services, but delivering fixed line services, as we all know, it takes a little bit long. And I think during this period, there is attractive bundle offers, we're able to further grow our customer base. And then, that combined with the fiber rollout that we see longer term, I think that's a sustainable strategy to defend against the market entrants of [indiscernible].
And on the financials we have an EBITDA increase of CHF14 million compared to Q1 2016. Around CHF7 million comes from a one-off for prior years. We don't see any additional positive impact in the remaining three quarters. But as I mentioned, we have also higher subscriber acquisition cost because of a high number of customers that compensate, more or less, the one-off from regulatory points.
Unidentified Analyst
That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Frederic Boulan.
Frederic Boulan
Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, please. First of all, to follow-up on the Enterprise side, we saw EBITDA worsening quite sharply in Q1, if you could discuss a little bit the dynamics you're seeing here. Is this temporary? Is this driven by the solutions trends? And what we should expect for the rest of the year?
And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about your segmentation. We're seeing quite a lot of activity on your side with Wingo in particular, in the last year or so. Are you seeing any change in dynamics here between your core and discount brands? Or you still have a very solid segmentation? And then maybe, if I may, on inOne. I know it's quite early day, but what do you expect will be the dynamics between the standalone price increases you've actually implemented versus the strat of people in bundling for instance, telephony or benefiting from some of our discounts and getting a discount versus what they're currently spending? Thank you.

Urs Schaeppi
Maybe Mario can take the question on EBITDA on Enterprise, but I will start with Wingo. Wingo is actually - with the launch of Wingo, that's our, let's say, online-only mobile project. We have the good stuff. And what we see is that we are able to attract price-sensitive customers. Hence, that the maturity is coming from competition. But there is also some price sensitive customers from who is coming and who are going on home Wingo. That's clear. But the majority is coming from competition, therefore the approach with Wingo works, it works. And our acquisition on our old brands, with the mobile, is working well and there we are on our plan. So I think the multi-branded approach works at this time.
To inOne, it's too early really to say, but clearly, we will have positive effects after upselling. The upselling potential we have in the triple-play offer, the share of wallet increase was mobile. These are the positive effects and the other sign is that we certainly have some customers who are going to - who will optimize themselves. But if we're going to offer them such a [indiscernible] ability, I think it will result in churn. Overall, we will have lower churn and the upselling potential, that's why I think we will have a better momentum with inOne in the actual market condition.
Mario Rossi
And on the Enterprise business, in Q1 compared to prior year, we lost 7 million on service revenue. I would expect that that trend will continue on during the next three quarters, more or less. That's again price pressure on fixed and mobile networks and the other 50% I would never expect that these trends will continue.
On the Solution business, as we explained, it was a weak Q1. I think we believe we see a recovery in the next three years as was explained, it was a - let's say, a weak start on the project business, there we see some recovery. But the cost savings, we saw cost savings in Q1 compared to prior year of about $4 million per quarter.
That will continue more acceleration. I would expect that overall I think we'll see some recovery. You can do now your calculations of that would mean on EBITDA level, but it will be a better EBITDA evolution in the next three quarters than in Q1 of this year compared to prior year.
Frederic Boulan
Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you, Frederic. Next question, Jakob Bluestone, Crédit Suisse.
Jakob Bluestone
Hi, Jakob Bluestone here from Credit Suisse. Just couple of shorter questions, firstly, just in terms of sort of customer perception as your mobile offering, I guess it's six months ago now that we have the connect test. You've obviously had some other mobile tests since then went more your way.
But I was just interested, has there been a shift in customer perceptions, things like net promoter scores and since the connect test back in December or perception is that your mobile offering is pretty stable or sort of heading in the right direction? Any color you can share on that would be useful.
And then just secondly, I didn't quite catch what was the decline in the MTR costs during the quarter. I think Mario ran through some of the individual cost items, but I think I might have missed that. Thank you.
Urs Schaeppi
Well, on the customer perception. We are doing regularly a net promoter score mission. We don't see an impact on our net promoter score. So that awareness, the perception of the network's quality is stable, high and clearly above our competitors. And yes, that's what I can say. That's what our customers are telling us.
And we don't - the churn problem - our churn in mobile is even lower than a year-ago. So we have a very stable mobile business. And then in Switzerland, a lot of marketing is done through this test. I think the test it's not the whole - it's not the whole reason in the market. And the network of Sunrise is certainly becoming better, that's clear. But the Swisscom network is a good one. You are also in Switzerland so you can talk with customers.

Mario Rossi
And Jakob, the impacts on the MTR, on revenue, it's minus 15 million net revenue and then on the cost side, minus 13 million. So we have a small benefit because the [indiscernible] was a little bit reduced.
Jakob Bluestone
Can I maybe just ask one follow-up as well and then you reported adjusted EBITDA growth slightly up, I think plus 0.6% and your guidance for the full-year is down. Obviously, quite a lot of moving parts through the year, and just actually new plans, which you said initially, it's dilutive.
But then I guess, you also have an easier comp later in the year as a result of the roaming drag being smaller in 2017 than in 2016. Can you maybe just sort of give us a sense of through the years - through 2017, which are the strong quarters, which are the weaker quarters, just given the fact that there's quite a few moving parts this year? Thank you.
Urs Schaeppi
I don't think that we should do guidance per quarter, Jakob. So I think I explained the four main drivers for the full-year, there I explained that we will see a little bit higher impact on fixed line loss, bit lower impacts on roaming. You have moving parts. For example, incoming roaming was strong this year in Q1, also because of the key role championship in [indiscernible]. On the other side, east will be differently in Q1 and Q2 that relate to outbound roaming, so I think we will quarter-after-quarter and then we see to the full-year guidance.
Jakob Bluestone
Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator
Next question, Joshua Mills.
Joshua Mills
Hi, thank you. And just a couple of questions for me on the Enterprise side, so just following up on the comment that the pressure in the Enterprise revenues from continued heavy price pressure, I'd be interested to know whether you're actually losing B2B contract or whether that price pressure is just coming through as you offer discounts to existing customers. I mean and if that is the case, what kind of discounts do you end up offering to customers in order to keep them on the Swisscom network?
The second one, you talked about enterprise EBITDA improving over the next few quarters. I wonder if you have kind of any longer-term guidance on when you think revenues can stabilize. Obviously KPN is in a similar situation, facing Enterprise revenue pressure at the moment, and they have targeted stabilization in the medium term. Is that something you feel you could commit to seeing the legacy declines and some growth in the new services that you see today? Thank you.
Urs Schaeppi
On the EBITDA, Mario can come later to it. But on the development in the B2B market, so we don't have actually big losses in the B2B market. It's going to take all of the customers, let's take the mobile market because actually, the main attacks today are coming is far in the mobile market.
If I took all the SIM cards, we increased our SIM cards. And then we have - our win factor ratio is a lot slow. So I think we have a stable comp situation in the B2B market. We're able to defend our position in the B2B market. But as you mentioned it, this is always also a price driven game, not only price but price discounts are important in such RFPs.
On the other side, this is always a very selective approach, so that's not to all customers. It's only a few customers where we have this aggressive promotion. So the main impact on our service revenue development in the enterprise market is driven by the roaming impact. But that was the big impact we had in the last quarter that was not by price competition.
Mario Rossi
And again coming back on the EBITDA, so in Page 17, we showed you the distribution of the revenues. And I think we should just look at the telecom business of course that has a higher margin. But we are quite stable in the solution business. And they are looking at this as a bundle, looking at the old book. We are confident that we ahead than in Q1 - as I explained before.

Mid-term, I think we are well positioned, for example, in the [indiscernible]. We are well positioned to redevelop this business, then also Cloud. Cloud services, I think, there are mid-term possibilities there to grow the business at a lower margin than the telecom business, but still at a decent margin and with less CapEx intensity. So I think that is what we can say for midterm perspective.
Urs Schaeppi
Yes, also digital solution is the digitalization of the industry is actually a chance or a potential for Swisscom, because with our capabilities, ICT capabilities, we will be able to deliver more solution. But on the other side, we have now some effect, but mid-term, I'm optimistic on the solution base.
Joshua Mills
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, Joshua. Next question, Carola Bardelli, Deutsche Bank.
Carola Bardelli
Yes, good morning. It's Carola Bardelli from Deutsche Bank. Thank you very much. I have a couple of questions on SAC, if I may. So I was wondering, what is the average ARPU that you are generating on your mobile subscribers in Italy and what kind of usage in terms of giga per month? And then I was wondering if we could have an indication on the margin that you expect to generate on the 90 million voice service contract one with the public administration? And lastly, if you could elaborate a little bit on your content strategy in Italy going forward, what you intend to do? Thank you very much.
Urs Schaeppi
But we don't disclose the ARPU and the gigabytes of mobile. But those percents, then you maybe can estimate that approximate with the ARPU. But on the margin on PA also, there we don't disclose the ARPU on specific customers. But you see that we are able to increase our market share in the market segment of the Japanese inflation.
And now also with the deal we made with Italy, we will be able to have a good and strong portfolio and position in the public administration market. Our content strategy in Italy, so we have a partnership with Skype, we have also the specific offers to address in March. Our intention is not to act quite in our [indiscernible] in Italy.
Mario Rossi
Maybe, Carola, asked if the $20 million is coming from the incremental revenue. I think there it has a little. We don't disclose margin per customer or contract, but we have an average margin because of the advantage of faster bit speed that we have a strong [Proxelle] that we don't need to run with [Proxelle] to deliver services to the customer on that average margin you have on this $20 million.
Carola Bardelli
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Matthijs Van Leijenhorst.
Matthijs Leijenhorst
Yes, good morning. I've got only - I have only one question left. And how should I look at the development of the retention costs in - because it's positively impacting your adjusted EBITDA. But what is actually happening there because what I understood is, last year, it was significantly higher. Could you give some more color on this subject?
Urs Schaeppi
We had approximately 30,000 less [indiscernible] this year compared to the prior year. But again so we had stable churn rate. That means we don't have a problem with the customer base. We had very high, very high retention cases throughout the quarters last year. So that doesn't make us nervous, this trend is less retention. And then you have at the low level, you have the impact of increasing number of SIM only customers often at Swisscom. We have to see multi-offering in the market, but it's very - it's at a low level. But you see there an increase in impact of SIM only customers. But overall, I would say that development as expected.
Matthijs Leijenhorst
Thank you very much.

Next question, Georgios Ierodiaconou.
Georgios Ierodiaconou
Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple on Fastweb. The first one is around - we've seen some news that you may be putting out accounts for sale. And I just wanted to check with you if there would be any regulatory issues with you being involved or any other issues, apart from price, that may keep you from being interested in asset? And then second question on Fastweb is around the timing of the change of the billing dates to 28. I believe that was in late February.

Is it possible - do you have an idea of what the impact it will have on your numbers going forward? And whether it's just in Consumer or whether some of the business customers will also be affected by the billing change? And then finally, very quickly a question on Switzerland, I just wanted to get a better idea on the target plan and the logic behind it.
And I understand you are expecting to get a little bit more upselling in mobile and you may lose a bit more voice line. What I wanted to understand is on broadband. Whether the improvement you expect to see is around net additions or the mix? Whether this is a tool for you to upsell higher speeds to the base?
Urs Schaeppi
Maybe I will start with inOne, and then Mario can come to the billing cycle and regulatory environment in Italy. inOne that I think that we will be able to keep our market share in this broadband business, but the market is saturated at the end. But with inOne, with an increasing ultra broadband footprint and the good TV products, we have a decent value proposition for our customers. But that the main advantage is actually coming to us in cross-sell, but the market is saturated, so the market shares will not shift dramatically from one to other, and that's why it is important to work on the share of wallet and upsell, and that's the idea behind inOne.
Mario Rossi
And on four weeks billing, there's no impact in the first half and in fact, we will see the impact in the second half. It's only for residential customers, not for the B2B segment, and the impact is included in the guidance. As you remember, we see for Fastweb a similar increase of EBITDA as in 2016. In 2016, of course, except the one-off coming from the litigation of Telecom Italia, and around BT, right now, it's too early to say.
Urs Schaeppi
Too early and let's say that I don't see any regulatory obstacles. But we just look at the situation in Italy, and then that's what we have to say around BT.
Georgios Ierodiaconou
Thank you.

Next question, James Ratzer, New Street Research.
James Ratzer
Yes, good morning. Two questions, please. The first one is regarding your inOne product, going back to that I mean you've mentioned a few times on this call that you're kind of excited by the opportunity of around 1 million people in your footprint set by other mobile operators. So two questions on that, specifically can you give us any guidance on how you are doing so far on upselling to that part of the base?
But secondly, what's the risk on the other side? How many Swisscom mobile customers do you have in particular in Sunrise and Salt homes - or sorry, Sunrise homes you could try to set upsell and target your mobile customers? And then secondly, just with regards to the FTTH buildout from Fastweb.
I mean, you've given the 2020 target, but at the run rate you are building out, it looks like you could hit that towards the end of 2018. So as a result, I was wondering if you could kind of, say, that you think you can hit that at 5 million homes two years early or do you think actually you will then maybe continue above 5 million and see a bigger opportunity there?
Urs Schaeppi
Well, on inOne there, as I mentioned before, it's too early to give more details on our performance of inOne. But we made the calculation, and we are optimistic that we can do upselling, and the second question is now do we have further churn potential on mobile, because in the areas where we don't have ultra broadband footprint. If you go overall, you have the market share of probably about 50%.
So that shows that that's already there on broadband there in a good situation for YouTube player offer. And with the household advantage, I think we have a strong margin to gain market shares. On the other side, the loyalty of the mobile customers is - I think we are working on customer service on the network policy. So I don't think that we will have a churn rate, a big churn rate on mobile therefore.

James Ratzer
Do you know how many customer you actually have in this Sunrise fixed footprint?
Urs Schaeppi
Sunrise has a footprint which is - they can work on the footprint of Swisscom, that's clear, because they are a wholesaler of Swisscom. But at the end, in a quadruple-play operate as a whole our portfolio, which is important. And then I think there in a good situation. We have the launch of the mobile. We have the advantage of the over the TV products. We have a good customer service. So there are a lot of arguments, which - say for Swisscom.
James Ratzer
Okay, great. And then on the FTTH point in Italy?
Mario Rossi
So if you look at the FTTx, so that means ultra broadband, and there we stick to our target of 30 million by 2020, I don't have the overall plans. But if you look end of 2016, we had 7.5 million households in the FTTx area, and if we [indiscernible] around 1 million per year, then we reach our target in 2020. But I don't know the exact lease negotiation between H and x. H depends also on the rollout with in JVs - within Flash Fiber and Telecom Italia.
James Ratzer
But it does seem that you are running ahead of the required rate on FTTH. I mean, so do you think you could see opportunity to increase above the 5 million homes?
Urs Schaeppi
Yes, but as Mario mentioned, really we are on the plan. We are not faster than announced.
James Ratzer
Great. Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you, James. Next question, Julio Arciniegas, RBC.
Julio Arciniegas
Yes. Hello, thank you for taking my question. Two questions, one regarding broadband, actually for example, this quarter basically the broadband net adds were negative when actually in 2016 they were all positive. Can you give us more color about the competitive dynamics in the broadband market? We know that for example, Sunrise is becoming more active. Do you expect this trend to change? Should we expect positive net ads in broadband in the coming quarters?
And the second question, coming back to the inOne, you mentioned that you don't expect revenue cannibalization from this offer. But can you help me to work out for example if I take that [AM] size bundling inOne is 190, and I believe that the previous [AM] offer, the price was higher. So how come we shouldn't expect any revenue cannibalization? Thank you.
Urs Schaeppi
On the mobile performance, as I explained, in Q1, there are different elements, which led to a weaker performance on the net ads. This is a chart shows elements like the migration of All-IP where customers are doing consolidation. Also [CPS] migration that's - these are the main effects, and there has been more promotional activity in Q1.
But overall, the performance of broadband is fine. It's fine, though also we don't get the churn - really a churn problem in this market. And with inOne now we have the possibility to even accelerate it. But don't think that the broadband business will be the big growth potential in a saturated market and we have a stable situation there. And I think it's too early, as I mentioned it several times, it's too early to give a bit more flavor on the dynamics of inOne.
Okay, operator, perhaps a very last question before we finish this call.
Operator
Okay. Your last question is Saroop Purewal, Redburn.
Saroop Purewal
I just had a question on - firstly, on your roaming. So I kind of noticed in your packages, you include roaming. But I was just wondering how important that is for the fresh consumer just to have it all included and they don't have to worry about it versus Sunrise's approach, which is just to add on roaming packages as a when? And then my second question was just regarding Salt and what you're expecting in terms of their fixed coverage when they're expected to launch later this year? Thanks.
Urs Schaeppi

Okay. On roaming, so also in the infinity choice, they have roaming included, depends on the tariff plan more or less stage. And what is here actually is that this really stimulates strong traffic. Two-third of the roaming traffic actually is done is a bundle. On the other side, we also with this, we see also with stimulation on the roaming packages.
So overall, the roaming volume is in data is strongly growing. And on the Salt, the footprint, I can't only make a forecast that over what would [indiscernible] they can take the footprint of the wholesale in - prior to the footprint in Switzerland. This will be approximately 30% of the households. That's one of the possibilities, and the second possibility, they can come to Swisscom and buy wholesale off from Swisscom, and then they will have a broad footprint or they will have a footprint in whole Switzerland, but this can do everybody in Switzerland.
Saroop Purewal
And have they approached you so far? And if they have, if those kind of talks - how those talks have gone?
Urs Schaeppi
Yes, but they always have talks on wholesale. They also - we don't disclose on the details of our talks, but Salt is a customer of Swisscom wholesale.
Saroop Purewal
Sorry. What was that? Salt is a...?
Urs Schaeppi
Salt is a customer of our wholesale products. But already today, this was already the case. And if Salt is coming to Swisscom and ask for wholesale products, we would offer them. We have the commercial on all of our products, which everybody can buy and we would certainly offer them this product.
Saroop Purewal
Okay, thanks very much.
Louis Schmid
Thank you. Also thanks to the operator. And With that, I would like to conclude today's presentation and call. Also thank you to all of you for your participation. If you should have any further questions left, please do not hesitate to contact us from the IR team. And with that again, thank you for your participation, and a good day and goodbye.

[Dictation starts abruptly] Capital S, SwissCom 02. With that I would like to open up the floor and handover to Martin to start his presentation.
Martin Voegeli
Thank you very much Bart for your introduction and also a warm welcome also from my side to you. As an industry leader in Switzerland, we see the importance of understanding future trends to which we align our strategies and actions. Therefore, we start our day today with a little journey into the future. Clearly we don’t know the future, but we can imagine it a little bit.
It’s my intention to be a little inspiration to show what beliefs we have behind our strategy work. Hence, I use today an order format for my presentation, I’m sure you will see this afternoon enough corporate slides from my colleagues. I will launch you through what we believe are the most important drivers of our industry locally as well as globally.
Doing so, I’m going to point out many examples that already exist today. We believe that those are good indicators of the direction our business will develop in. Since, these strategies like to structure things having crossed my insights around four major topics. First, software based businesses, then the Internet of everything, third, the global competition and last but not least the changes of society which can be recognized as proof, as driver and also consequence of the other things we’ll discuss in the next minutes.
Let’s go to the first topic. Software based business address the first major implication of digitalization. A huge part of products and services in the digital is software rather than physical goods. In other words, the focus shifts to the services we can consume online and the things we can do with our increasingly marked devices.
Second, software supporting also new business models especially as a smart connector between supply and demand. Let’s take a tremendous disruption within the hospitality and tourisms industry as an example of what software in combination with other trends such as sharing economy can do.
F&D believes to decrease the revenues of New York’s hotel industry by 10% in 2016. And even more impressive and that is the speed at which this is happening. From my end it’s a good performance to add 30,000 rooms a year F&D can do that within only two weeks. However, most of the trends also have chances coming along with them and the example of New York forecast show that another $740 million can be generated due to additional tourists visiting the city, spending more money in restaurants or for entertainment and distributing their spending more evenly all over the place as they are not limited by the hotel location anymore.
Another example is 3D printing. Here software comes into play because literally it builds hardware anytime at any place and practically without logistical challenges. These are only some of the things that can already be printed, the range goes from all sorts of technical and replacement parts over consumer goods to even parts of the human body, the ear for example.
Last year a card has been printed and in the internet you can find big industrial printers capable of printing a house within 24 hours. Just imagine what substantial impact that is going to have any many industries.

In the field of telecommunication, we see further disruptive technologies on the broader line between software and infrastructure. I would like to point out four short examples, the first one is mesh networks where the connectivity network is build of devices acting as notes.
Second is the E-SIM, the embedded SIM which integrates hardware and connectivity service provider. The third one is software defined anything which allows virtual network services and fourth one tactical internet which enables network for real time, control instead of pure communication. What does that mean in reality? Doctors can only be in comp calls, they can do real time surgeries from anywhere in the world, autonomous cars can find their way around obstacles in real time.
We’re well aware of the fact that some of those things imply some risks and disruption for our industry as well. But, at the same time we see them as chances not only to increase efficiency for SwissCom, but even important to discover a new generation of services which will guide our clients into the digital world.
Let’s jump to the next section. The Internet of Everything addresses the increase in connectivity between humans, between devices and between human and devices. Of course, these trends goes hand-in-hand with other developments that I’m describing for example, the connection between everything is a central enabler for software based services.
We know that the internet is already an incredible complex network with pillions of points around the planet. Indeed, if we visualize a small part of the internet, it looks like that isn’t that amazing? It’s a little bit kiosks, but it’s very creative. And exactly this hyper connectivity will undeniably have stronger impact in the future not only because it can leverage and utilize much better, but also because it’s growing exponentially.
In fact, we believe that 99% of the potential things are not even connected yet, so there is much more to come. Having said that it does not surprise that an astonishing $14 trillion market is seen in this field between the next 10 years, partially because this developments resources for higher efficiency and for new revenues in almost all industries and we as SwissCom will participate in our role as Trust’s companion for digitalization.
If we speak of this huge potential we’re talking about a power of the combination, the integration of people, processes, data and also things, concrete examples, our smart cards, intelligent viable, personnel assistance or home robotics. In order to do not get into abstracts let’s see how this integration could look in real life. One of our supplier illustrated that in a short film.
[Short Film]
Talking about healthcare, the interaction of people, processes, state and things will allow the health sector to move from reactive to proactive, you saw that in the film. Simple apps will help us to prevent or at least recognize health risks very early. The Internet of Everything also means that within 10 years from every one of us will be surrounded by 3,000 communicating and interacting objects every day. I guess what I’ve said before about mass network becomes a bit more tangible now, all will be connected.
Chapter 3 of our short journey brings us into global competition. Clearly, digitalization happens in the internet, the internet doesn’t stop at country borders, therefore digital competition is necessarily global competition. So, let’s have a look at the global stage, they’re not only surrounded by our local competitors, but the peak global payers as well.
We’ll know that already today received them as strong forces in our digital market. What we also see at the global stage are millions of little highly active and innovative people in their garages dorm rooms already developing the next big thing. Any even - from the next week global players in the past five years we saw some impressive examples of that.

How do the big successful ones compete? They don’t create independent products and services for full integrated synergetic and harmonic ecosystems. This allowed them to service their communities holistically and esthetically which creates strong walls around ecosystem. Have you tried lately to check from Apple world into other world or vice versa that’s why it’s a nightmare. You lost data, you lost your apps and the big one has tried to really create strong walls and with all these developments, the global stage becomes very dynamic. It’s full loaded, it’s hectic, so one of the challenges in the digital is to become a room and to remain relevant in the head of clients, building up the solid community that receives the services as in rich be helpful is a key success factor.
Let’s drive our attention to the question of how innovations in this world are made. Are they always new and fantastic technologies, are they always based on huge investments and some sort of powerful assets, obviously not. If we look to just these examples Huber or Hoober beginning the biggest personal transportation provider without every owning one car. WhatsApp is the biggest messaging service provider without one component of network equipment and also AP&P I mentioned it before is the biggest accommodation provider without only owning a single room and Netflix is one of the most powerful content provider without DVDs or rental places anywhere in the world.
What this example show us is that digital innovation are only a technical thing, they’re most of the time a customer focus service of a business model and based on the simple and available technology. And those things can be developed with very little resources and deployed with incredible scale.
And the big players know that most of the innovation comes from the small houses shown before, so they constantly watch out to acquire these businesses to keep their innovation hedging up and running. Interesting to know that Google integrates a new business in their ecosystem every 10 days. I personally think that the ways service are invented, developed and placed in the market can teach us at SwissCom a lot about our future business as well.
And finally, the changes in society. Again, we see as proof, as sources and also consequences of the other things we’ve been talking about. Today’s kids grow up with digital tools and media, they learn to use devices and handle digitalization incredibly fast. I’ve seen kids playing with iPads before they learn how to speak, it’s very easy for them. Needless to mention that these kids grow up as true digital natives.
You don’t need to physically attend courses at university anymore to get a degree that also implies that every run from everywhere on the planet can be the teacher, be it a professor at Harvard or startup entrepreneur in South Korea. Language issues will not exist in the digital world anymore, our communication services will be smart enough to translate everything in real time.
That also means that we can work from everywhere at the time we refer with the colleagues and the networks we chose and of course for various businesses and clients. Imagine you covering the telecommunication industry on a global level independently not being employed by your company or rather writing reports for all sorts of businesses around the world clearly from home being recommended and rated by the community. That brings me to the end of this little trip into the future, what are the key takeaways in my opinion of you. We’ve seen the software as the basis for digital world that is an essential driver of huge developments with this cost to scope and impact of the Internet of Everything which I believe can be as profound as the invention of the steam engine.

We had a look at the global stage and recognized as global, not local players dominate the peak ecosystems, but innovation is not only driven by big players and global players don’t act as a local companion into digitalization.
And last but not least, we got a taste of how education working and living will be influenced by the big chances that the utilization brings along. The trends are changing people’s behavior and the society as a whole. Clearly, there are also additional megatrends which will have an important influence on our market environment. For example, the collaborative economy or in other words the power of the crowd, the aging of the society or for example, the personalization of services based on data insights. All of these trends will come into future for SwissCom it is very important that we also reflect the signals of these trends and get our own view of the future as a base for our business activity today. I hope these thoughts had some inspiring points and could give you a little insight of how we see the industry dynamics and the bigger picture.
Let me now handover to our CEO, Urs Schaeppi who will explain our vision in the context of our beliefs and who will lead us through the SwissCom strategy. Thank you for your attention.
Urs Schaeppi
Thank you, Martin and also a warm welcome here in the windy area. I would like to present to you a very short the main pillars of our strategy. And as Martin mentioned before the route or the idea of our strategies really to be the companion of our customer in this digital world where we see a lot of opportunities for a company like SwissCom. And what are the - really the main pillars of our ambition in this world, it’s quite simple, building up the best infrastructure have excellent networks in the wireline and wireless area, then deliver a superior experience that means simple products, better customer service and the search pillar of our strategy is to go in new areas, in areas where we can grow, where we can create new business because you know it’s better than our traditional business has a price decrease and so we’ve to look for new basis. So that’s the main idea of our strategy and I would like to give you now the main pillars our strategic topics where we’re working on.
You see it on this slide, it’s structured by infrastructure by experience and then by this growth opportunities. And first, going to the infrastructure, what is our ambition and what are our projects on the infrastructure level. So, our ambition is to have the best coverage, the best ultra band coverage in our networks and you can see it on the wireline site today we’ve a population coverage of 97%. And our ambition is to increase this coverage and also the speed in our mobile networks, in 2016 we want to have 99% population coverage with a speed of up to 150 megabits per second.
At the end of this year, we’ll have LT plus to LT advanced in our networks already today if you have the right handset, we’re delivering 300 megabits per second. At the end of this year we’ll have 450 megabits per second in our network, it always needs the right handset and this is also clear really that you must be in an optimal position, but already today if you’re travelling around in Switzerland you have excellent on the mobile network. If you’re travelling from Berne to Zurich on the highway and if you measure the speed with your iPhone you have 50 megabits per second, you’ve test here in Zurich of 100 megabit per second and this shows actually the potential of our broadband network.
So, speed and coverage in our mobile network is a key pillar. The second topic of our ultra broadband strategy, it’s clearly, it’s the ultra broadband wireline network. Today we’ve 1.4 million customer which have ultra broadband connections, at the end of this year we’ll have 1 million households which has fiber to the home connections. And our ambition for the year 2020 is to have 85% ultra broadband coverage that means a coverage above 100 megabits per second, so key pillar of our power strategy.

The second key pillar in the infrastructure area for our strategy is cloud. We’re convinced that the business, the technical business models but also the product business models are going in cloud based solution that’s why we invest in this cloud business and also for ourselves, our ambition is to bring 70% of our application in a way through IT world, in the cloud or in the cloud of SwissCom. We’ll have products, cloud products, public cloud, private cloud, but also hybrid cloud. And I guess that’s the advantage of SwissCom in this cloud business, we’re a local player, the datas are in Switzerland which gives us a differentiator and then cloud project is always an integration project, where you need local footprint, where you need local engineering capabilities and that’s the strength of SwissCom and that’s why we’re convinced that we can differentiate us to the global players which are also delivering cloud products. Cloud is also one of the big growth opportunities into future.
If we go to the product side or experience side, for a company like SwissCom it’s important that we keeps relevant to our customers that means we must deliver relevant internet services where we can bring a local value add. And this we do with examples in the communication area i.e., that’s our communication and draft application we’ve now 1 million downloads, we’ll work on it that it will increase, small plant that’s growing.
In the entertainment area we’re very successful with our TV product, TV 2.0 it’s a cloud based product on android, on an android base and after several months after the launch we’ve already 300,000 customs on this product and we’re really gaining market share. So, it’s not only the product that is also convergent to the mobile world which is important that you’ve a seamless experience between your big screen at home, your mobile or your PDA.
A search chance for an operator like SwissCom is also for advertising area. As a local player we’ve datas, we’ve assets to really make advertising much more targeted, much more personalized and that’s why we’re investing in such areas. One of this company is local dot CH, it’s a search and find company where we do advertising, targeted advertising for SME market.
And then, the diverse pillar of our internet strategy as we call it My Digital Life that’s actually, let’s say, you see as it a big picture, it’s your avatar or it’s my day if you go in a small picture. And we’ve their first products [Doc Save] for example and we’ll bring a lot of new products in this area in the future years. So, internet is a differentiator for operator like SwissCom.
Then another very strategic important pillar in our business is enabling layer. We’re convinced and it’s not a miracle, it’s quite clear, we’re convinced that the business is de-layering we’ll have an infrastructure layer, we’ll have an enabling layer and above there will be a lot of companies who are delivering software services, software as a service. And our ambition is to create an enabling layer with different building plugs where software companies can create quite easily new products and this will bring more load to our network and will increase our shares, our market shares into core business of connectivity.
And there are elements, the elements of search and enabling layer is security as we have it with our mobile ID, mobile ID is a secure SIM card where you get a really trustful access to the digital world or big datas, we have a lot of very interesting project on big data where you can really make the world more intelligent, you can make smart city and all such things. Certainly also into payment and billing area and operator bring some capabilities with it. And then, a very important point are these APIs where we see a big potential to really improve our enabling layer.

So, enabling layer is an important part we’ve to create also an ecosystem behind it a developer community. Customer service is very, very brief, it’s crucial for a company like SwissCom. Each inhabitant of Switzerland has a product from SwissCom, if we don’t perform in the customer service we’ve a problem. If we perform in customer service we’ve better revenues, high loyalty so that’s really a part where we’ve to try each day to become better.
Then on growth, it’s a quite short term, the biggest growth lever for a company like SwissCom is the bundling. If we’re able to increase the market share of our bundles, we increase the share of wallet with our customer and then if we’re even able to have a small up sell Marc will come to it to later on these bundles that’s really the area where we get a big impact in the next two years. So, bundling is a key pillar of our work on the wireline triple play but also on the mobile site where the base of this bundling is infinity.
Another area where we can grow in a digital world are the verticals, in the B2B world there is a lot of potential to create IT revenues and if we take banking for example which is an important vertical of SwissCom we’re the market leader in banking IT solutions in Switzerland, we’re doing there. BPOs, business process outsourcing, but we’re also into area of back office solution or front end solution. And the market is really changing, the banking industry is changing to digital bank, but also to the huge pressure of regulation in the banking market leads to a lot of opportunities for us as an IT provider.
Healthcare, long term healthcare is a huge potential for a company like SwissCom, it will not fast moving, but long term it’s a big opportunity also if you look to all the variables which are coming to the hospitals and connection between doctors, it’s really let’s say stone age, normalized paper, no IT in it, so a big potential for us. Energy is also a market where we can grow and therefore we’ve a vertical in the imaging area.
Some words to Fastweb it, we’re unhappy with the development of Fastweb last year, they outperformed the market and I’m convinced that we can create additional value with Fastweb and it’s not our intention that we sell Fastweb, we want to develop Fastweb. And you see, I’ll come later to it, you will see what are the main pillars of the strategy of Fastweb, so also important is network, network quality, ultra broadband network in Italy. Our ambition is to go up to 30% footprint, ultra broadband network having partnerships is important for a company like Fastweb to get scale that will come also later to it. But also and that’s a very important initiative for Fastweb in this year is to improve the service quality, increased net promoter score.
If you want to do this, we have actually a huge transformation project before us. I always tell the example, if you look to the revenue structure of SwissCom and if you go 10 years back we’re doing much more than 50% of our revenues with products which happened 10 years ago that shows actually the transformation of our company. And we’re going much more in a software oriented business that’s another company. Software company and telecom is not the same and that’s why we need transformation project in our company.
On the technology side their robust work is all IT, all IT infrastructure, APIs but also on the personal side and on scale side. And therefore, we’ve there a program on corporate level to accelerate the transformation of SwissCom.
So, the summary of the strategy is quite simple of the best infrastructure, deliver excellent product and excellent custom service and then invest in the right growth opportunities. Now let me say some words to the revenue development and EBITDA development. It was a very successful year 2014 for SwissCom. We were able to grow by 270 million on revenue and you can see it on the slide, the main growth is coming out of the bundling business, so good performance on the revenue side.

We were also in a good way, we were able to increase our EBITDA by 110 million, you see that a lot of this EBITDA increase is coming out of the service revenue with our bundling business, so we’ve about 100 million EBITDA is coming out of this bundling business. We had because we had quite an intensive competition certainly in the fourth quarter or so in the handset market, in the mobile market also a bit correlated with the launch of iPhone 6, we had quite high subscriber acquisition costs, but the good news of it is these customs are retained for 2015 and not each month, there is a new iPhone 6, so we’re quite happy that Apple has innovation process which is a bit slower than one of Samsung.
But, good success with EBITDA, also if you look to the different quarters and to previous years see that we had a growth. In the fourth quarter the growth is not there because of these higher socks, but overall the dynamic, the main pillar also in Q4 were strong. 
So, now I’d like to handover to Marc, our Head of Residential to give you some more details.
Marc Werner
Thanks Urs. You’ll had gave me some notes I’ve to talk about I guess. For example, network, for example, service leadership, for example, bundling on IT and I’ll do my best to talk about some notes about this at this point.
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, in my previous role, I was in marketing and sales, head of marketing and sales and also head of service department that’s why I tried to talk a little bit about satisfying customers and why happy customers - make SwissCom happy and hopefully also make investors happy.
I’d like to in my first part talk a few minutes about our current performance and how our focus on bundling and investment in network and touch upon the excellent payoff and the second part will be a few moments to tell you how we’ll deliver in the future goals from continued focus on bundling on innovations and on cost excellence of costs.
Bundling focus and investment payoff to see all the demands in the point, we continue to grow in our wireline and in our wireless business responding by 270K we used in 2014. Despite separated markets and new market and place for example last year, centering the mobile market in Switzerland. In wireline these goals is driven by the TV business as the CEO already mentioned also. We had increased the TV customers from 1 million to 1.165 million during 2014, in my view an excellent growth. And also in broadband we had an increase by 4.4% and we could offset declining voice lines by 3.5%.
Our market share in mobile business continues to grow, at the same time we see a positive shift from the prepaid to postpaid which added to 146K use in our mobile business. Also we see various developments growth in TV business as I mentioned, where we managed 2014 about a quarter to market. It gives us the opportunity to be the biggest paid TV provider in Switzerland in 2014 for the first time.
Archives still are going very strong by the bundling performance, we had increased in 2014 from 3 million to 3.6 million - sorry, from 3 million to 3.6 million archives in bundle in 2014. Almost 30% of all archives are all bundles and if leaving out mobile then its 57% of all archives of all ID bundles, 57%. Bundles obviously means for us low return, less metered revenue and since you’re bundling in some new innovative services like for example TV 2.0 we’ve a higher customer satisfaction on our bundling customers then we had it before. In a nutshell bundlers for our customers, but bundles are also very good for us at SwissCom.
A strong contribution goes about 650K bundles archives is coming from TV as I mentioned, 70% but whole ID 80% of new TV subscriptions are in the bundle. I’m very happy about that that bundling success in TV and broadband continues and we see also encouraging brand, the same brand in fixed voice and in the mobile business.

In 2014, we launched a new marketing leading TV product called TV 2.0 with some very interesting features like for example 7-day Replay or for example up to 1,000 hours recording in the cloud.
Hence, as the CEO mentioned since we launched [indiscernible] we had 300,000 customers on this new product. It means, you can calculate by yourself that it means per day 1,000 customers since we launched the product and that for us, I guess for Switzerland it’s really a huge performance.
And then, right before Christmas, we started our new content product it’s called teleclub play it’s a kind of a Netflix product to mention like this. If you don’t find any content on the TV 2.0 that’s quite rare because you have 40,000 hours content already on your TV for online TV 2.0 because you have about 250 channels, same day replay makes about $40,000 content, it’s already here. But even if you don’t find anything on this content you have teleclub play and since we launched in Christmas we had engaged in a couple of weeks to about more than 10,000 customers. We are very happy about this because of course TV product, the platform, the features are very important but the most important stuff still on the TV business is a content you watch on your TV and not the features.
This TV market has been growing in Switzerland 2014 by 4%. SwissCom increased by 20% that means little bit strange it’s even more than the total market and the total market has 66% of all paid subscribers we got during this that’s the idea as I mentioned before for the first time also the biggest paid TV Digital provider. It means 66% was net paid share in 2014.
And TV 2.0 is not just a huge success on a subscription base, it’s also a huge success on the customer satisfaction having almost all aspects, the better customer satisfaction than we had before with the previous TV product and that’s very important for us because that means TV makes our customer happier, but TV makes also our customer more fitness.
As CEO mentioned that for us very, very important is the network of course, even as I’m for the consumer business, the network is very important and that’s especially for the fiber business particularly, we chose - in 2014 about 74% of all customers who are connected to fiber, [indiscernible also took fiber and that’s an increase from 2013 to 2014 from about 8% points.
We see a strong momentum in the French part of Switzerland in the fiber business. For example, we had a growth in [indiscernible] from about 140% during one year or in Geneva almost 100% also in 2014. Geneva is also the city is to pick, is the most access customer we have in Switzerland is about 22,000 fiber customers already. Followed by -- is about 15,000 but also in the German part we grew a lot in 2014 more than 100% in Zurich, more than 100% in Winterthur that’s very important for us. Of course because as CEO mentioned we invested a lot in the fiber business and we have to grow this on subscriber base. And you could also see that we still grow in archives in the city.
Obviously, migrating some legacy customers to the fiber network that’s for sure. But overall, we have been able to increase the market share in all the cities we have already the fiber network.
Our mobile investments are also paying and for the 6x it was on the chart from -- I was particularly mentioned for the six times in the row we won the Connect test for the best mobile network in Switzerland. And for the first time we even won for the best mobile network in the Dutch region in 2014 that’s a real big success and our CTO is also in the room. Thank you very much and that’s really a big success for you and your team that’s for the sixth time in a row we won the Connect test.
And as mentioned before we have about 97% LTE population we have started LTE, you mentioned the right mobile phone, you need to have the mobile phone and I did test by myself that’s my mobile phone, my plus mobile phone is a 4G plus and Samsung and with this phone you are really able to have download speed from about 180 megs, I did it myself in no time it works. I know it, I did it myself and it’s a great experience to have more 150 megs on your mobile phone.

Touch phone, the increase to cost channel experience for our customer in 2014 with several internal initiative and it seems really to be a big customer need. When we look at that the quantity of customer which have several contexts, several touch phones different contexts this number is increasingly very fast in the last 12 months. For example, customers they have some interactions with the call center and email, visit their website and today we are able to know the customer better and to give him the service he wants to, he doesn’t has to explain a several times on several touch phones what’s the need or what’s the problem he had.
And Switzerland remains still more service focused than European neighbors. Service availability, service quality in shops and in our call center are still key pillars to justify the premium price or ARPU as we have in SwissCom. All that SwissCom shops I don’t know, ladies and gentlemen if he knows SwissCom shop nearby there is one, yes nearby there is one and that still a big key differentiator vis-à-vis our existing competitors and also potential new entrants. If you have the possibility go to SwissCom shop and I’m sure you know what I’m talking about.
It’s also very impressing that every customer interaction for example, a shop as I mentioned but also a call center interaction increase our customer satisfaction dramatically. So while we obviously incur costs with an interaction, it pays off for us as it makes customer less likely to return, it means really if the customer has an interaction results, if he mention the customer satisfaction before and after that interaction, the customer satisfaction after the interaction even if he called us because of the problem its customer satisfaction is higher than before. And that’s I guess not really normal and it’s because of the quality of our service, the quality of our touch phone.
Future growth many of you focus, as I mentioned ARPU increase is still coming from the customers who migrate from non infinity to infinity that still the main driver for the ARPU increase, but of course on the lower scale because declining migrations. It means we will continue to create even more attractive infinity tariffs to continue to migration to infinity, but also from infinity to higher infinity subscription tariff. For example, this was mentioned before included some digital live product or included some roaming revenues as we piloted for example last summer.
The inclusion of the metered revenues component reduces of course the overall volatility of our revenue. Also this year or last year we started to optimize our legal portfolio and we managed to shift 120,000 subscribers to the new bundle. We managed to increase the ARPU not a lot but we managed to increase the ARPU by 1 Swiss Francs, it seems not to be so much but we achieve that without a negative ARPU normally if have a new product as we had with infinity couple of years ago you have the net effect as the customer optimized themselves and with the learning we had with infinity we changed the strategy in the wireline business and that's why we didn’t have any ARPU decrease, we had even ARPU increase Swiss francs.
For us a big success because we learned from our ability in the past and we did much better and it works. Future goals from mainly focusing strong customer satisfaction, we had also introduced a couple of new tariffs in our entry and medium level segment. That's the product we have for the entry and medium level segment. We introduced for example a price plan a couple of weeks ago it’s called One, and we increased the sales on weekly basis with this price plan by 30% that means we have now on this price plan about 1,000, 1,500 customers per week, a huge success for this brand. And we also have a strong customer satisfaction in the entry segment with our brand and merchant that this customer satisfaction is much higher than the customer satisfaction with our main competitors.

Given increase in preparation of core markets, need to deep into financially attractive adjacent industry to grow revenues potential. CEO mentioned one market for example has market for us quite important and will be much more important in the future. It is important suite population benefits from an increase in the high edge more than 50% of those born today expected to become more than 100 years old in Switzerland and if I get these figures I am quite happy that I am born little bit earlier to be honest. In fact more [indiscernible] small, fast moving companies and we have more than 30 international and Swiss acquisitions since this venture established 2007.
Last but not least, we have to talk about cost. And about the all IP program that’s quite important program for us because we have to target until the end of 2017 that we migrate all our customers on the all IP infrastructure. In 2014, we had a growth there from almost 200% that means we migrated from 200,000 customers to almost 600,000 customers during 12 months. And in 2014, almost all new products were produced on IP. For example, TV 2.0 was the biggest natural driver for all IP migration that means the people wants the product and if they’re not already on all IP they have to change on all IP and because they want the product there is no big pain behind the migration because we all know it's not so easy to migrate from the past infrastructure to all IP. But even there we learned a lot in the last couple of months and for example, we decreased the contact activation by 23% which is very important for the cost level. And of course also for the service level in our customer care, if we migrate 700,000 customers per year.
The summary from me are three points. The first, we look back at another successful year that our continued focus on bundling, network investment and touch point excellence has meant that we’re able to increase our market share, bring innovations to other market and delight our customer. The second, our challenges for the coming year will be to continue that growth path by focusing on our team growth, on value management, on cash and tariff innovations increasing share of wallet and of course also on cost excellence. And the third point, we feel well prepared for that journey of satisfying customers on a good basis for continued success. They tend to be more loyal, have lower churn rates and in Switzerland they still tend to spend that little bit more than maybe in other countries.
And really last but not least, our personnel maybe message I especially want to thank to my team for dedicated commitment and performance. I am really proud to lead such a department which they convince and inspire our customers in such unique way and that makes me very confident that also the growth can continue in 2015. Thank you very much.
Question-and-Answer Session
Bart Morselt
Thank you Marc, very good, okay. It's 3 o'clock we are little bit ahead of schedule so my spontaneous decision is that we now take three questions which you don't have to ask after the meeting. And that's a good idea because we have nice drinks after the meeting. We will be using a microphone. Why three questions because it's more than two and less than four. This is the only reason for three questions. Please wait for the microphone. Who has the question. Fred, let’s try to focus on the first part of the presentation by the way.
Frederic Boulan
Hi, so it's Frederic Boulan from Bank of America. Quick question on the all IP migration you just mentioned. Can you talk a little bit about the implication that we will have for your business in the long run in terms of availability to save customers, also cost efficiency, CapEx efficiency so detailed plan here? Thank you.

Marc Werner
You mentioned cost efficiency first section, I didn’t understand it very well, cost efficiency -
Frederic Boulan
It bites on your cost structure, on your investment so are you currently spending money to do this all IP migration and what type of amount are we talking about where can you see investments in the long run once this all IP migration is completed?
Marc Werner
As I mentioned before, the plan is in the residential business of course and then we have the SME business and the enterprise business. In residential business the plan is to migrate all the customers until 2017 and of course then we see two points. One point is customer satisfaction because all IP migration is still a little bit lower customer satisfaction because the migration is still not something that customer really wants to make I think it is something he has to make.
And that's one point and I guess, an increase after the migration, we can increase the customer satisfaction and second as I mentioned that we have now 23% less customer interaction activation means it's still higher than it was before, it means until we have migrated all the customer we will have more OpEx also in our customer care and of course then the attention is after 2017 that we can decrease these costs, but that's from the OpEx level and I don't, it's not my thought I guess to make any sentence on the CapEx level.
Urs Schaeppi
Urs will add something to that. If we compare to costs of a migration in all to the - all IP world we have today approximately 50 francs additional per customer. But, we are on a learning track and this cost will go down and then if we have once migrated that the costs are much lower because it's much easier to switch off new services if you are once into all IP world. So today we have high costs but we will bring them down.
Operator
Very good. Okay. Second question will fall to you, Vikram, UBS.
Vikram Karnany
Yes, thanks. Vikram from UBS. I have a question on infinity. Now infinity as you were flagging earlier is reaching pretty much close to what your target level is around 70%, so and clearly we have crossed our two anniversary as well, so are you looking at in mobile per say a new proposition to drive growth something like same only proposition entering that particular market or do we expect to say some tweaking of infinity, say infinity 2.0 is probably the next kind of move in terms of mobile to drive growth? 
Urs Schaeppi
Actually two questions. The first is yes we will increase the value of infinity that's our strategy to give our customers more value not only by pricing or roaming, but also with features they are looking for that's one part of the question. The second is SIM only, that’s a good question, up to now the Swiss market is still very subsidized oriented and we don't see actually really a big market in SIM only. But, if we see that the market would change, we would certainly very fast react but today its niche market and even competitors who are offering SIM only product at the end they subsidize the handset in the second way. 
Martin Voegeli
We do - we have SIM only offer in the end budget line. 
Urs Schaeppi
The product I mentioned before the one, I mentioned on the embedded level this product is a SIM only product but it's not under SwissCom brand it's on the embedded brand on the entry level. But that's the SIM only product. Our first one.
Operator
Sure. The final question for this round. Jakob first row yes.
Jakob Bluestone
Thank you. Just a question on the TV product. Can you maybe just remind us on the content differentiation, are there any particular differences in terms of the content that you have on your TV platform versus your competitors do you find any particular content that you need for or something else?

Marc Werner
Yes. There is differentiation. We have all the [indiscernible] it's okay and that's exclusive on our TV platform.
Martin Voegeli
Yes, but we’re referring to the difference between the first TV and TV 2.0.
Jakob Bluestone
Actually, is there any content that your competitors have which puts you at a disadvantage because you don't have it?
Urs Schaeppi
Not to the best to my knowledge that we have football range.
Martin Voegeli
We have good content proposition.
Jakob Bluestone
Okay. Thanks.
Urs Schaeppi
Like TV 2.0 product adds on top of that you have a cloud based product instead of hard disk recorded base product and that differentiates us from current competitive positioning.
Martin Voegeli
Okay, I think we can start. I hope you had a nice break. We also care for our customer, for not only customer satisfaction but analyst satisfaction. You will tell us at the end of the meeting. So, corporate customers are very important for SwissCom group not only due to the revenue we do with them between the small and medium sized business from my colleague here in the room and myself we achieve to generate more than 3.5 billion revenue last year with business customers. It's not only that. It's also important because corporate customers are very demanding customers and they force us to be innovative and to go beyond our own limits.
But, also due to the consumerization of the IT, we see more and more that corporate customers and mass market customers are converging and honestly I make a bet with you, I am not sure if you meet us in five years time, I am not sure that Marc and myself will still be there as head of customer office in unit because we see more and more the trend towards - what we say ecosystem from B2B, B2C and what we do for example right now on the e-health market where we bind together doctors, patients, hospitals, pharmacists.
We really believe that their future belongs to ecosystem that will be, we go beyond the bias of B2B or B2C. So, it's a very important market because it forces to be really innovative and looking in the future. So the question for us in the board of directors last year was to see how can we improve our presence and be even more relevant in this big market. And what we have decided in 2013 was to merge our Telco and IT activities on the corporate side.
In 2007 already SwissCom decided to move from the traditional old mobile and fixed line organization of business lines into a customer facing unit organization. It was one of the first Telco worldwide to do that. And I was at that time in charge of the new residential unit, so maybe I am the managing guy because now I have to do it for the corporate customers. So, we can say SwissCom is always at the edge of the convergence. And we do the similar step last year by managing also I think as well as of the first Telco worldwide, the Telco business with the very specific IT business, so we now an ICT provider and the biggest one in Switzerland.
By merging these two units that during ten years live separately, we brought together 5,000 stuff and is probably one of the biggest merge last year in Switzerland. As you can imagine we did important post merger integration and the challenge for us was to do it without impacting negatively the business and the customer satisfaction. And I am happy that we have achieved this performance.
Now, it's the first time that I appear here in this room with the corporate segment and we believe that you need some information to better understand and qualify this new business which is quite complicated with very broad. So I’ll not so much insist on performance figures as Marc did on the mass market, I believe it's more an educational session to tell you what is this market and what are we intending to do there.

The rationale for the merger are clear. We want to be better for our customer. We want to be better for employees and we want to achieve better performance for SwissCom and for our shareholders. What we have served in many years is a change of the way companies are dealing with IT and telecommunication needs. The former organization with separate responsibilities between IT responsible and telecom responsible using big corporate companies does not take place anymore. They merge the activities together and they intend to have one single supplier able to answer the full spectrum of their need from Telco to IT. They are strongly impacted by the pressure on cost but also on the rising digitalization of their companies.
CIO needs to be much closer to the business and to do that they must have less [Qs] and commodity IT and for that they need to have strong partner that do that for them. I met some weeks ago one of our customers - this small companies are very often under served by our competitors. But we also work for very big companies. So we have the full range of customer. We have specialist of several industries. And for certain types of IT product you need to be strongly specialized. We have the capability to serve our customers not only in Switzerland but we have also to follow the customer strategy meaning that we don't intent to go after foreign customers. But we have the goal to be able to serve our Swiss corporate customers when they go abroad. And for that we have a strong networks of partners enabling us to serve our customer worldwide.
And last but not least, we can serve our customer where they are today not all customer are ready today to deliver the IT out of the cloud. Some of them want to be still on premise and we can achieve that. We can deliver not only infrastructure services, enabling services but also on the application there up to the business process outsourcing. So, in terms of business and scope we are really unique. 
Now if you look at the organization we have, as I mentioned we have one customer on the sale side with a unique account management team representing all product of SwissCom enterprise. So, same we have back office with one unique customer service and in the middle of that we have created what we call solution centers. You can almost consider them as P&L because they have revenue and direct customer responsibilities.
In these solution centers, you find the full responsibility to deliver the customer project from consulting, specialized sales, solution architect, project management up to application management and exploitation. We have organized the six solution centers on the topic where we want to be market leader. As you can see here we have two solution center that are more Telco oriented, the wireline and the wireless business. We have the new infrastructure cloud and data center. And we have two strong services that we want to deliver, workspace and collaboration for the stuff of our customers and more and more digitalization of business processes.
We have one specificity which is a vertical banking area because we serve more than 200 banks in Switzerland. And we have also besides the six solution center, a so called business development unit in charge of the European new business, so growth of tomorrow. For example beside banks we are now acting concretely in two further verticals that are the utility market and the healthcare market.
As I mentioned we have a broad range of customer. What is for me interesting last year is to notice that we have more and more customer taking everything from us. If I just take one example the contract we made with Deloitte, Deloitte asked us to make a full ICT outsourcing which is network, mobility, virtual computing and SAP. And we have several customers that are more and more getting to full range of portfolio.

For sure we have competitions. It's a tough market. Customer are demanding, customer have bargaining power. And we have a strong price competition coming first from the bargaining power from the customer expecting every time lower prices but also coming from competition which is not only national but also international. We fight against big IT companies worldwide, cloud based companies more and more and we fight against small local system integrators that have very close relationship to customers.
So, we have the local small, global big and our position is unique because we are local big. So, there is nobody bigger than us with Swiss roots and this give us the good mix between capacity to act, capacity to deliver and at the same time proximity. The result of that is a net score of 32 which is high in the corporate market.
And as I told you we believe that the corporate segment can be a growth story. We can grow by developing new product as we do today with the SwissCom cloud that is interaction this year. We can grow by winning new customers. Customers that are not working today or that we are winning back from competitors. And we can grow by creating new markets as I mentioned for example on the health or energy sector.
As I told you we are not bring you with these figures, this year but nevertheless, I couldn’t resist to show you the development of the order entry because for me it was a little bit of question mark early last year. Are we - will we be able to increase our revenue discussed in the year where we merged two activities and in every kind of PMI risk that people will be more concentrate on the internal re-organization. So, I am happy to be able today to show you that despite this merger, we have the highest order entry we have never achieved if you make the addition of the former telecommunication business and the former IT business which shows a potential we have in this segment.
Now, I would like to spend some time on these slides because I need to let you understand how various segment is compared to the two other segment in the mass market. We are not using SwissCom price as telecommunication business alone. We are not an IT business alone. We are providing our services under various forms. The telecommunication business you know is very well. It's a front loaded business with big CapEx platform that's scaled and it's a good business if you have a lot of volume on your platform and the cost was a fixed cost.
On the IT business, it's another business. It's not so much front loaded with CapEx we don't need a lot of foreign invest. We have more direct cost and the margins are thin and need a high management attention to be delivered. SwissCom IT services, our IT company has developed in the last ten years, a very good way of monitoring these slow margin business. And I would do a mistake if I would try to manage all these values businesses with the single view and single source, therefore we need to keep specificity of these businesses and therefore we should pay attention not to be willing to achieve too much cost synergies because it could be valued as threat at the end of the day.
In this department we develop product. We are product manager and this product will be sold to many customers. But, we have also project business, which are very individual where we have to pay attention to the chargeability of the people working on the various projects. And you cannot make the business the same way between the product oriented business and the solution business [indiscernible] projects.
We are making system integration where we are really on-site. We are delivering managing services out of the cloud. So, as you can see in this talk, we manage several businesses. We set our drivers, several dynamics and I would not like to have your job and to be obliged to compute all these complexity to try to preempt the result of next year. But we can talk after the break on how to do that.

As you probably heard, we have end of last year made the biggest acquisition as a group in the French speaking part by acquiring the Veltigroup. Veltigroup is one of the most successful ICT company in the French speaking part of Switzerland, but is also doing 25% of its revenue on the Swiss German market. Why did we make this acquisition? First of all the GNP of the ornery is 25% off the Swiss GNP. This means that there is an important market there, growing quicker than in the German part of the Switzerland.
Veltigroup in the last four, five years grew by two digit every year. It was a good business to do there. To serve this business, I had until the acquisition of Veltigroup only 10% of my stuff. It was not enough and we were not able to deliver on the project the customer wanted to do. So, as a first rationale is to better serve these parts of Switzerland But, the second rationale is the following, Veltigroup is a very agile company delivering system integration closer to the customer on an individual way. And SwissCom is more keen to make product that adds caliber.
So, when we have to deliver individual services we hadn’t knew too much complexity. Thanks to Veltigroup, we can do much better also individual needs that we find mainly on the mid market segment these 2,000, 3,000 seats company where the IT department is not ready to take fully standardized product and still need to have a certain degree of individualization.
Moving to the time we need to work together with Veltigroup to make out the best integration of these two activities, but the goal will be to keep the ability to deliver from one side fully managed standard product out of the cloud that scales and from the other side to serve individual needs of our customers. If we achieve it will be absolute unique USB on the market.
And my last words are back to what our chief strategy officer said at the beginning to potential of digitalization, we are lucky. We are lucky to work in an industry where after the first technology of digitalization with smart phone, a second way of coming what we call now the EPL digitalization The unique combination of technology description like big data, artificial intelligence, virtual IT, iPad mobility and internet of things we lead to a new industrial revolution. One speaks to there from industry 4.0. This new industrial revolution will change completely most of the industry especially in Switzerland. The place to work, the business processes, the go to market of companies will be completely reconsidered with this change.
And for us this means a big business opportunity. How are we going to tackle these? We will open in few weeks a new business campus in Zurich. We will organize with board of directors from our corporate customers’ workshop where we will discuss together about the digital strategy. According to surveys 80% of the Swiss company today have no real digital strategy. By engaging to these discussions, we will come to very interesting project.
With new digital technologies, like big data, like software defined networks, we will deliver both on demand and we will accelerate the business of our customers because in the digital time, it's normal the big companies that are eating the small, but the quick companies, the ITs are the slower one.
Last but not least, SwissCom is acting in the corporate market and for sure also on the mass market. We have millions of private customers and we have been impacted ourselves by the digitalization over the last ten years.
We want to use this know how to help our corporate customers to reinvent their own interaction with the end users. Therefore, we believe that the digital revolution will also lead to new forms of interaction between our corporate customer and their end users. As you can see on the slide three examples of new business emerging from digitalization, we are now going to invest in a so called low power wide area network, a new network that will be able to connect with the low energy expectation or the connectors that will pop up everywhere in Switzerland.

We are concretely now testing in the return industry and in the tourism industry, location based platform that help for example in the tourist in those key areas help the tourist and the city to have other types of interaction with people who wanted to come for skiing. And we have launched last year a crowd funding platform for the banking industry to help balance to better serve new forms on lending and funding. So, for me it's a big excitement to be. There are this point of time where obviously the Swiss economy will be fully impacted by the digitalization because the survival growth opportunity that we still have to invent and to structure over the next few years. Thank you very much.
Unidentified Company Representative
Good afternoon everybody also from my side . I will start with the quick description of 2014 result. If I had to choose one word to represent 2014 result, I would definitely choose growth and the growth comes if we look financials because point one we will go in details in a second represent the good growth in revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow. But, also growth is the right word for operations because we have been leader for third year in a row in the residential broadband world and we have been also leader in the corporate segment and these happens since a lot of the years.
Also if I look at the network rollout and the overall ultra broadband world, we are definitely the fiber company in Italy with the market share that is almost 70%. And also if I look the future I think we are on the sunny part of the street because our plan to further expand our network and also our plan to leverage continuously on innovation, not only on broadband infrastructure but also for instance on data center infrastructure or WiFi infrastructure. I think is strengthening also our possibility to succeed in the future.
Let's go into details. These slide shows basically financials, I think that from whoever side you look at the slide I think you will find the positive news because if I look at revenues we are posting 3% growth. If we strip out the hub in revenue, so the low marginality revenues that actually growth will be even higher almost 4%, if I move down the P&L also the EBITDA shows and confirm an important growth 2%. Also CapEx are let's say confirming a high level of investment also in 2014 basically we invested more than 30% of our revenues, clearly 2013 and 2014 represent for us extraordinary years because we are deploying a huge fiber roll-out network.
We will go in details in a second. But also if I look at free cash flow, ordinary free cash flow, so not consider these extraordinary rollouts of the network, I would say that having also 2014 almost 50 million of generation of free cash flow is a good result. I would say that in a nutshell those results are very strong, very solid in an absolute terms, but also if you put such results in the overall Italian contest that we are all, our competitors are posting actually different results and not growing but actually decreasing I think that also, it's strengthening the result and the performance of our company.
If we move to outside operations, we start then with residential business and instead of talking just of one year, the good thing is that we can talk about the last three years because the story is always the same. If you sum up the growth of Fastweb in the last three years basically you can see that we eat almost 500,000 new customers. But if I look at basically all other competitors shows that they basically the older market reach 400,000 so it means that all the other competitors were negative. So if I sum up telecom Italia, Vodafone and Wind basically they were decreasing their market share which is pretty much self explanatory because if we look at the market share basically we have been growing our position by 3% where telecom Italia has decreased and all other competitor where almost flat.

But that was basically just the family business. If we go to the enterprise, also here the situation is quite solid. I can divide the enterprise word in two types of services. The voice and letter and where you can see a solid history growth because in 2014 we have been able to overcome the 30% threshold market share, we are almost at 32% and also the good thing is that also in the value of this added services we are growing in a good manner.
In 2014 basically the market share remains flat not because our revenues were flat but actually because also the market has grown and that's very good news. Having said so, also here if we want to draw some conclusions, we look at our much Fastweb market share has grown it the last year basically here we are talking about 6% growth. We are basically all other competitor have decreased their market share. 
If we move today with our broadband, which is quite a fashionable let's say topic to discuss these days. Here I think we have even better teacher because if I put together the fiber to the home market and the fiber to the street one, basically you can pretty much see that we have 70% market share specifically in the fiber to home market not withstanding or nevertheless that competitors have started fiber offering since four years ago, I think at the end of the day all competitors take up in the last four years has been 10,000 customers which is not something that makes us awake at night.
Overall, with our broadband world I think is lead by Fastweb in a very let's say important way. But that was the present. We need also to look at the future and if I look our plan of further investing and further expanding our network, I think as I was saying before we are in the sunny part of the street because in 2014, we finished our first expansion basically at the end of 2014 we were reaching 20% of population, Italian population with our broadband network we re-launched the investment and the actually our aim is to cover 30% as Urs was mentioning earlier by 2016. This is an ambitious plan but I think that these natural continuation of our rollout. The first rollout was performed to eating all our expectations with no delay in time, with no delay in performance and therefore I think it's the right moment to push and accelerate or further expand our ultra broadband network. It is an ambitious project because we will be the largest - it will be the largest wireline NGN built up by an operator in all Europe.
The good thing is that we have chosen a very solid technology because fiber to the street technology is not only a very good technology today. On average, on our clients we are experiencing today 80 megabit as a performance. Italy as a unique in particular cabinet architecture, they are very, very close to the final user on average 250 meters. And this allows the possibility to exploit significant higher performance if compared - even if compared with other European country. We have recently done some field test with real customers. So not loud test, and we try to test all the possible evolutions starting with the vectoring, with VDSL and also coming to the G-fast. The good news is that if want to consider the highest performance on average, we can reach with G fast over 300 megabit as a performance, but the good news is that whatever technology you use the 95% of lines and so of family can go above 100 megabits. This is a very good result. It's not just Fastweb that is saying so couple of days ago, also British telecom announced similar I would say results with their performances. So, the good thing also if we look at the future we need to smile because we are investing in the right technology and actually we have quite a time advantages versus all our competitor.

But, as I said infrastructure is just the first layer. We are not serving just families. We are serving also business. Therefore, we invested a lot also in value added services, managed services, cloud services, and we also build a tier four data center that we just finished. It's the number - it's the first in Italy and only in Italy. So also here we have very good time advantage. Is the fifth in Europe and the fourth I think is the one that SwissCom has created and this is the 17th in the world. So, here you can show that Fastweb is getting market share because for using and delivering superior quality if compared with the others. All of our other competitors are focusing on price. We don't compete with price. We compete with infrastructure and quality.
Coming back to the residential, we are testing and actually launching two cities a very interesting services at least we believe it will be a very - it will have a very good appeal in the customers. So basically we want to extend the customer experience that normally a customer lives in his home also outside. So basically we want to let's say integrate our broadband network with a WiFi network and we will use modem like G Go in all for instance basically we will leverage on customer modems on old spot and the good thing is that we selected two mid tier cities, the penetration after just one month was 20%. G Go waited at least six months to get to the same let's say penetration rate and also the daily usage is very, very good because we are talking about on average 23 megabit. So I would say in a nutshell, the performance of 2014 of Fastweb has been extremely good, is near of growth and basically also if I look at the future we have all the good ingredients to repeat the very solid performance of 2014. Thank you very much.
Mario Rossi
Good afternoon also from my side. Finally, some numbers, some facts and figures. I start with revenue just some highlights. So, we are able to grow revenue in Switzerland by CHF 121 million that’s mainly driven by high margin service revenues. 103 million increase of service revenues in Switzerland and here I would like to point out the very strong performance of residential, service revenue grew by 3.5% or over CHF 100 million and also the market performance was very strong.
We added over 180,000 revenue generating units, market added 75,000 postpaid mobile customers, we increased TV subscribers by over 16% and the growth of 160,000 TV subscribers. SME delivered stable revenues that’s a good performance because we enjoy very, very high market shares in this segment and the most important thing in the corporate segment is, you remember back in 2013 we had declining revenues in the connectivity business especially in the mobile. Corporate segment was able to stop these losses both in fixed mobile and the revenue losses only in the single digit area. We had already good performance from Alberto, 2.8% growth in revenues in Italy.
On EBITDA, EBITDA results exceptional increased by 11 million before we saw that the service revenue in Switzerland increased by over 100 million, you would now expect that EBITDA at SwissCom, Switzerland level would increase maybe by 75 million, 80 million that's not the case. We will tap in between we had higher subscription as Socks and SLC acquisition and retention costs, 57 million more than back in 2013. There are two reasons; one reason is we had more retentions, about 55,000 more retentions compared to prior year and the second reason is we had more market dynamics. The KPI per subscriber was higher and the impact was about 30 million.
Really we had more competition, usually we are not the first to move as the leader into market, but Switzerland is handset driven market so we had to follow increase our subsidies in order to maintain our market shares.

That's also the reason why we see a slightly small EBITDA at SME and corporate I would say was able to more or less to deliver stable EBITDA. Fastweb EBITDA of 550 million Euro once again I think that's a strong performance in that difficult environment now in Italy.
The breach from EBITDA down to net income EBITDA was 110 million higher than prior year. On depreciation we have 50 million more that's clearly the reason because we had more and higher CapEx during the last few years that's just accounting impact of that.
On other financial results we have a negative impact from a value adjustment of interest rate swap we did some years ago, last year we had the positive impact of around 30 million. This year we have a negative impact of the value adjustment, non cash value adjustment of about 75 million.
Income taxes are 40 million higher than last year. Last year we had some corporate restructuring in Q4, but the tax rate is still quite low, is 18.3% long term tax rate is still around 21%. But clearly that's I think is an advantage, still an advantage of investing in the Swiss company enjoying these low tax rates.
A few words on CapEx, CapEx in Switzerland increased in 2014 by about 60 million and if we look at the different CapEx categories, we invested in fiber to the home, fiber to the street, fiber to the building. So, this whole fiber story around CHF 440 millions that's 150 million more than 2013.
We are able to keep CapEx more or less stable compared to 2013 there are two reasons, we had lower CapEx in the wireless area. We invested about 240 million, 35 million less than in the prior year and in project IT product development, we invested 300 million, 80 million less than 2013. About to explain the last rollout on FTTS was completed in 2013/2014. The next one will be at less expensive so we saw the CapEx peak in Fastweb in 2014.
On operating free cash flow, after the cash flow proxy, I think you have one element in 2013, we had a decrease of networking capital in 2014 we had an increase of networking capital that's just by accident over the year end, there are no structural changes I am not worried about these evolution. No structural changes. 
Talking about cash flow, after the operating free cash flow, we paid net interest and the taxes together approximately 600 million, it makes a net cash flow of 20% taxes of 1.25 billion out of that we distribute 90%, 20 to Swiss francs dividend per share that means 1.14 billion. We had to increase our net debt by 300 million mainly because of the acquisition of PubliGroupe, the purchase price was CHF 475 million, then you can deduct some acquired cash and outstanding minorities CHF 24 million and we already started with the sale of securities and major participations which gave about 65 million cash inflow. Key ratio net debt over EBITDA remains unchanged at 1.8x.
Then in 2014, just a few notes on the refinancing, we did three refinancing transactions I would say very successful one in Euro, two in Swiss Francs, the last one we were able to get 50 years at 1.5% just as an opportunistic refinancing and we will do so also this year using this low interest environment. Just to mention, in addition to that we have credit lines with 8, unused credit lines with 8 banks, with backs facility of CHF 2 billion.
The situation of our net debt which stands at 8.1 billion by the end of this year, you see about 60% or over 60% of finance by bonds. 1.3 billion of finance in Euro which helps to hedge the Euro investment in Fastweb and quite happy to the maturity profile we have one peak in 2018 where we have a due date of a Swiss Franc bond of 1.42 billion with a coupon of 3.25%, but overall we are happy to financing, average cost of interest is slightly over 2% also here I think that’s clear advantage of SwissCom and Switzerland compared to other European peers.

Some words on the pension plan situation, I think that's a - the other side of the favorable inter situation for a corporate, what matters in terms of cash and financing is the Swiss pension law. And not IFRS, these two worlds are totally different. Under the Swiss regime, we have a coverage ratio of 111% which is the surplus of 1 billion, so the pension fund is around 9 billion in our pension fund. But due to other assumptions on the discount rate and the mortality, the IFRS picture is totally completely different. In our accounts on the IFRS, we have to show with deficit of 2.4 billion of this the gap between Swiss accounting principles under the pension fund and IFRS is 3.4 billion, 80% can be explained by this interest rates decrease last year. You see in Switzerland we calculate this 2.75% down on the left hand side on the IFRS we have to use a discount factor of 1.13%.
It’s really important to know is that cash contributions are not based on IFRS valuation method. And the contributions in 2015 are likely to decrease by about 20 million compared to 2014 will be around CHF 240 million, CHF 250 million. The reason is we will have a lower number of early retirements.
But on the P&L again it looks different. We will have around 70 million higher pension expense not cash pension expense booked on the personnel expense which will explain the main part of our low EBITDA guidance on a comparable currency basis.
With that I would like to discuss the outlook slide with you. So, we don't know where the Swiss Franc will go in 2015. We decided to build up our guidance on parity hoping that it will not stay at one CHF for the Swiss economy. The left hand side you see the results of 2014. the ForEx impact mainly technical impact consolidating the Euro at CHF 1 the revenue and EBITDA from Fastweb on a comparable basis derive a net revenue at 11.3 billion, EBITDA at 4.3 billion and CapEx at 2.3 billion in 2014.
On net revenue, we expect in Switzerland an increase of CHF 100 billion, at Fastweb in local currency more or less stable. That brings us to an EBITDA at revenue guidance of for 11.4 billion for 2015. On EBITDA, we expect in Switzerland around 100 million less EBITDA. There are three reasons. First reason, it is non-cash pension cost increase of 70 million. second reason, you remember we had quite high gains from sale of real estate in 2014, this will be 50 million low in 2015 and then migrations to all IP will have slightly higher cost for this all IP migration, but overall we can say Swiss business on an operational basis more or less stable 2015 compared to 2014.
At Fastweb level, we have a slightly higher EBITDA clearly benefiting also from the results of the FTTS strategy which really works. We can migrate customers, we have lower fees to Telecom Italia and we have lower chance. On CapEx, in Switzerland CapEx level will remain unchanged. Fastweb as I mentioned it before reached to the peak in 2014 will drive slightly lower CapEx despite the last FTTS or the new FTTS rollout. It's important on free cash flow level, on the free cash flow proxy there is no material impact on the foreign exchange impact.
Of course, it's difficult to predict how this situation after mid of January for Switzerland what will happen with our economy, if something dramatic will happen then of course it might have on the long term, mid long term also an impact on our business.
Coming to dividends, no surprise on that since 2011, we stand CHF 22, we think the CHF 22 it will remain like that. We will propose to the AGM next year, no surprise to 22 and if we reach the targets 2015, we will again propose to the AGM 2016 to pay out of CHF 22 per share. I think it's still the good dividend yield over 4% in this environment.

A few words on the impact of the currency changes, I think it is cost that impact on the P&L and cash flow, on balance sheet the impact is very limited. Equity ratio is not impacted by these changes on the Swiss franc situation, I mentioned that the free cash flow proxy remains more or less stable. Now talking about the hedging strategy, we usually hedge cash flows per yield we need to buy the couple of 100 Euros and a couple of 100 U.S. dollars both positions are in the Euro case unfortunately hedged for 2015 so we don't get this windfall profit, but again the exposure towards these two currencies is very, very limited.
Finally, as you can imagine what you heard from Christian, we need to do a restatement because we merged ITS onto corporate business, so the main part of ITS which reported in the past, in the segment offer will come to the segment and the former corporate, part of it will go to the segment network because that was divided. Then we will have some other small adjustments regarding real estate company and marketing. We will deliver the new segment structure and the new numbers before we publish end of - before we publish Q1, it will be published I think mid of March. The new numbers? The restatement? Okay, okay. Mid of April we will deliver to you the restated numbers that you can adjust your spreadsheets.
With that I’ll hand over to Bart for the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Bart Morselt
Thank you, Mario. Alright, we have a little Q&A time now and we are well in plan. So, who can I give the floor? Let’s start with Nicolas, here first row again. Sorry Carola, I saw you are late, but you are second. Do we have microphones? Yes they are coming up.
Q - Nicolas Cote-Colisson
Thank you and Nicolas Cote-Colisson, HSBC. I’d like to have your take on the first coming four month of telecommunication law, I was wondering if you could have a impact on the wholesale prices for fiber and if you could create some opportunities for Orange or Sunrise to be more aggressive in fixed broadband?
A - Mario Rossi
So it is the telecommunication law is in a discussion in the parliament. And I don't think that we really will have an impact, a major impact in the next two or three years on this level. And then, it's always if such a law in discussion, a lot of things are open, but the revision what the regulatory is asking for are really smaller changes. So, I don't think that we will have major changes there.
Q - Nicolas Cote-Colisson
So, would you think that Orange and Sunrise have some abilities to disrupt your very high market challenge for fixed broadband? 
A - Mario Rossi
No. 
Q - Nicolas Cote-Colisson
Another way to ask, okay let's take it differently then. Investment scheme, we had discussion during the coffee break with the utilities. Obviously that happens to your fiber and to the grant being build that potentially can be resorted to your competitors, how do you see that changing in the coming quarters?
A - Mario Rossi
Yes, that's a good question. What could happen is that the utilities which are building up to fiber networks only in cities and in several cities they could do wholesaling and now the question is to which price and this could lead to a price pressure that’s clear, but if you look to the Swiss market overall that the market is still driven by the bundling business, by the service collecting, but it could give some price pressure. But, really we all take this consideration and account for 2015 and I think it's much too early to make speculations about the strategy of Orange in Switzerland I think it's much too early.
Bart Morselt
Alright. Next question goes to Carola.
Q -Unidentified Analyst
Thank you and maybe a couple of follow-ups. Back on the utilities, I was wondering what is the population coverage that they are able to offer a commercial service alternative to yours in currently and what is the plan? And another scenario that could be discussed if we were to consider potential Sunrise or Orange merger as back in 2010 what would you see as potential remedies to allow this merger to go ahead and back to Italy instead I was wondering if Fastweb is currently happy with no agreement with Hutchinson on what's the performance on 4G, don't you feel the need to be more competitive maybe with the team and both funded have probably better service on for 4G and then maybe a brief comment on the proposal by [AGcom] on the wholesale prices in Italy. There are couple of scenarios presented which would be the best and what you think Vodafone's reaction would be? Thank you, finished.

Bart Morselt
Carola, we are seven men here. We cannot cope with ten questions at the time. So, let start from here, first one perhaps on the utility coverage.
A -Mario Rossi
Utility coverage fiber is about 30% but they are only in the cities actually. This gives the population coverage of 30%. Then the second question merge Sunrise and Orange, it's difficult to say. It would from an industrial side, it would make sense from the industrial side there would be synergy on the network side. On the other side, but that's only speculation. I think the regulatory would look in another way to such a merge today than several years ago. And remedies, I don't know but there would certainly be some remedies. 
A - Martin Voegeli
And we would certainly have new distributions of the licenses of spectrum because then they would have too much spectrum.
Bart Morselt
You want to take on?
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Okay. On let's say the mobile, and I think that we should see our revolution as a modular step, first we would become full [indiscernible] even if we have been always, we have invested a lot in the mobile. But, our first step will be to become [indiscernible] so to have full control end to end also of the SIM. And then, definitely it will be important for the future to select one or more partners that can deliver the same quality that we are delivering on the fixed cost on the mobile.
But bear in mind that in the future I don't think that would be any more in mobile and network and a fixed line network because also the WiFi will take an important role and that's why we are going in these direction also with the WiFi coverage because what we want to achieve is to repeat the same experience indoor also outdoor, and also the WiFi can be much more effective than any mobile network.
So, I think that first of all in the future we will have all the right tools in order to offer a very good experience regardless if you are indoor or outdoor. Coming back to AGCOM, AGCOM is now put as consultation two scenarios. Normally, I find strange to have two scenarios. But Italy is always full of creativity. Having said so, for us I think it's critical this sub-loop not only for us actually because also other play decided to deeply invest in the FTTS technology and I think that all the results are showing that that FTTS and so that sub-loop is key and therefore we do expect that in the future coherently also to increasing competition and order decision that also these AGCOM for 2013 we do expect a decrease in the sub-loop. For us the most important decision that needs to be taken is on the sub-loop.
Bart Morselt
Alright. Next question here Georgios, second row.
Q -Georgios Ierodiaconou
Thank you. Perhaps a couple of questions on Switzerland and you discussed about the cost of all IP rollout, I remember in the past you also considered the significant small cell deployment which hasn’t really picked up momentum. What kind of cost should we expect from all these type of project having mind to improve quality and to be prepared for the future and if you could also maybe give us an indication of what are the savings that you will get from all IP migration at the end of the process not just avoiding these cost but savings beyond that? And maybe a question for [indiscernible] on metro where all the noise is going there obviously on a halter there, what kind of outcome do you expect and will that change your plans on the fiber to cabinet rollout if it's accelerated? Thank you.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Good. Maybe on all IP, so the big investment in the IT systems are done. So, the investment what we have now are more OpEx because we have to migrate the customer and that's one point. We get savings on several areas even when we are -- the first one we can switch off the TDM network. The second savings which we get is we are much more agile in product developments so we get shorter time to market. And the short benefits are the cost. Cost for migration, for example, if you are moving your location today you have a physical intervention. If you are in the all IP world, you just push the button and then the migration is done. So, in the future we will have lower cost to serve. Lower cost to deliver but that’s the main rationale behind this all IP topic, but we will have certainly some years where we have to go through this migration and the challenge will be certainly the B2B segments because there you have solutions. You have PBAX business in it. So, we will have some work to do in the next year.

A - Unidentified Company Representative
And related to metro web, yes, it's true. There is, metro looks like a very fashionable topic these days in Italy. I would say that I hear a lot of words, but I never see an industrial plan. And as Fastweb we are much more interested in substance and industrial plan rather than the new ones. I would say that for us and we know metro very well because we created the company and we are still owner of 11% stake is a local player.
At the end of the day, I mean, we are interested in the national coverage. And the European agenda sets important target by 2020, we have technology when it was possible in the right cities we have deployed fiber to home technology. Fastweb cover the seven main cities in Italy with fiber to the home. But, the technology of all and now we have fiber to the street technology which has been proven to be future proof, very solid and most importantly much more sustainable, much more quick and therefore I mean the market is free.
We selected such technology, Telecom Italia selected such technology, Vodafone has selected such technology. If metro wants to deploy with its own money not public money with its own money some fiber to the home in some second tier cities. They can do it, but for us we have never been against the infrastructure competition. We have been always competing the market by our infrastructure. Definitely, we think that the time advantage versus all our competitors in the future will increase rather than weakening.
Bart Morselt
Very good. Our next question [indiscernible] in the back.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Yes, thank you. Just building on St. Georges, this question there on IP spending CapEx if you look at your CapEx breakdown that you gave in one of your slides, slide 53 shows that the IT systems all IP and other CapEx spend was materially low in 2014 is that because of the fact that you have done all you need to do for your IP spend on the CapEx side and now you are moving to OpEx, is that the explanation for that drop?
And secondly, if we look at the profile of your spending it was a lot more fiber network driven in 2014, is that what we should expect you to be spending a lot more on going forward i.e., is the split for 2014 a picture for the future as well as to how you are going to spend your money in Switzerland? Thank you.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
So the drop 2014 compared to 2013 is exactly what you mentioned, it's break through is the CapEx for all IP. Going forward, I would expect more or less the same profile like in 2014 but within fiber midterm we will see a change from FTTH to FTTS because FTTH will be completed by end of 2015, but the overall amount will remain in 2016 for fiber around the same.
Bart Morselt
Alright. Next question from Jakob.
Q - Jakob Bluestone
Hi, I have got three set of follow-on questions. Firstly on regulation I think there was also some parliamentary discussion going on roaming so maybe if you can provide a similar update to where that debate is and what your expectations are on roaming rates in Switzerland?
And secondly, again also sticking with CapEx your mobile CapEx as you mentioned is down to 10%, 15% in 2014 versus 2013. Given you have got very strong growth in mobile data traffic how sustainable do you think it is that mobile CapEx is coming down. Do you see I think you said in your annual report that your mobile data traffic is doubling annually do you expect the mobile CapEx will have to start to rise again or what you think you can continue to see further CapEx declines?
And then finally, just one point of clarification on the tax, I think the tax guidance you gave was P&L tax if I understood correctly is the same true for cash tax because your cash tax is going up about 100 million every year for the last couple of years?

A - Unidentified Company Representative
Good, maybe on the first question of regulation and roaming. In the parliament there is an ask for roaming enterprise regulation in Switzerland, but there will be big debates on it. I think the regulator sees it in another way and we will make price moves on the roaming in the next weeks. So, I think we will not have fast roaming regulation and the technology will change it to much faster than the regulation will be implemented. So I think there is - that’s not the really risk and then on the CapEx and tax, Mario.
A - Mario Rossi
So, we spent cash tax around 380 million and it's same all assets. That's a good amount. It's always difficult from year-to-year it depends on the different assessment from the authorities about 380, around 80%, 90% is a good number. And on CapEx, yes in 2013 we had higher mobile CapEx because then we started this whole renovation of the whole radio network. We went in each and every antenna and then we had - and started rollout, we had slightly lower CapEx in 2014 and this high data traffic that brings some additional CapEx in terms of software, but that's a low double digit number. So overall, if you add 10 million, 20 million to the current mobile CapEx you are in a good range. But don't expect lower CapEx.
Bart Morselt
Upfront here Usman.
Q - Usman Ghazi
Hi, thanks for taking the question, Usman from Berenberg. I just wanted to just discuss I mean, the Swiss domestic outlook revenues is up 100 million again this year in almost no operational leverage implied by the guidance. Now you said that last year or in 2014 that was because mainly because of higher sack as the other competitors trying react to gain a bit of market share forcing you to give away more to just keep your market share, would it not be more sensible strategy to let the other guys have a bit of market share so that you end up - because at the moment you are getting the revenue growth but you are not getting any incremental profitability because you are having to spend more just to keep that market share any views on that would be great?
The other question I had was just on the WiFi strategy in Switzerland I mean, we discussed in Italy but in Switzerland haven’t heard much on that point. So, I would be interested on that?
And finally, again on mobile if I look at the mobile churn rates they picked up in the second half, they were only 11%, if I look at the data file they have gone up to 12% over the second half as a percentage point in two quarters which is a bit high. I am just wondering what drove that? Thank you.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Okay, we will take first two questions and then Mario will take the churn one. On the development in Switzerland and then the market share and that was your question how strong do we want to defend our market shares. So, we are in a fixed cost business. And in a fixed cost business we will fight for this market share. So, we will do it in a clever way to differentiation but we certainly fight for market share. And WiFi strategy what we do is actually we have safety WiFi network. We do this. We have public wireless - public WiFi networks also for a bit uploading our networks into cities. And indoor what we are going is for WiFi calling because if you have the new buildings which are very good isolated, it's hard to get indoor coverage and that's why we go for WiFi calling but that's approximately our strategy. And we are quite robust against this safety WiFi because with infinity you get, you can eat tariff so we don't care to much about this other WiFi networks which are coming off. It's more an offload technology for us.
A - Mario Rossi
And slightly higher turn rate on mobile is because on higher churn on prepaid. We don't disclose the postpaid churn for competitive reasons, but I can assure you that postpaid churn rate is one of the lowest in Europe and it was stable during the whole year.

Bart Morselt
Alright. Next question from [indiscernible]
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Hi [indiscernible] from Numara. Just a quick question about the infinity tier going back you said that you started structuring your added value and features to that. Could you give an idea of what kind of up-selling within the tiers that you saw during the year, please?

We will do good things on this topic. There are lots of people who are hearing to this conference. No, I think we don't really disclose what we are doing but we will do good things within infinity to increase the value of this product. Keep the churn low, keep good net additions.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.

Fred?
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. First thing on the CapEx side you shared the vision a couple of years ago about the CapEx cycle and we were in a peak CapEx movement for couple of years but then overtime you were painting a picture with declining CapEx once you reach a milestone on fiber in particular. So can you update that view and more of a follow-up here seeing rest of your target was 80% covered by 2020 in [indiscernible] speed I think -- so here I notice now down to 100, so I’m not sure if there is different technological choice embedded?
And then, third question if you could just clarify your roaming exposure with bit more details in terms of roaming in roaming out and what kind of scenario we could sensitivity on this year in terms of prices but also just volumes, this was in FX movements, what is the sensitivity in the business if you see changes in tourism or any other factors? Thank you.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Maybe I will take the first part of the question concerning the technology mix of this broadband network and then Mario can answer to the more financial topics. Our footprint of 85% ultra broadband in 2020 is a mix of - it's the technology mix. One fiber to the home with more than 1 billion of the customers will have fiber to the home and the rest is actually fiber to the street with also G.Fast so we will go G.Fast in 2016 and this will bring us speeds on fiber to the street G.Fast which are much above 100-200 megabit. But that’s the mix of our technology. To go faster on coverage we will push fiber to the street and G.Fast. Maybe on the figures, Mario.
A - Mario Rossi
I think you refereed to our midterm guidance some years ago. I think that time we really thought that after the FTTH rollout this fiber story, complex story is over. What we see is we are still very high competition from the cable operator. We have cable coverage in Switzerland one of the highest over 90% and if you want to remain in the fixed line business as was explained we need to deploy [indiscernible]. Fiber investments we need to deliver higher speed, and we really on the pressure also from the political side to deliver not FTTH but ultra broadband also in rural areas. That's the reason obviously that at least until end of 2016, we will have this high CapEx level for fiber and then we carefully evaluate the situation, but we still have this competition with the cable to be of higher churn, to meet our broadband and TV targets and then we look again at the situation.
On roaming we have this in 2014 we have the roaming revenues outbound of slightly below CHF 400 million. That's the decline of about 10%-15%. We don't disclose the margin and inbound roaming was below 200 million.
Bart Morselt
Alright. In the back Luis Prota.
Q -Luis Prota
Yes. Thank you. It's Luis Prota from Morgan Stanley. Two questions please. First is on the triple play offering and you were mentioning that the migration from non vivo to vivo is just driving 0.8 extra Swiss franc ARPU, so the question is what are the dynamics there. So I don't know whether there is a lot of free TV included there or there are many moving pieces so I would like to understand why so low the ARPU accretion there?

And the second question is kind of rephrasing a question on infinity that was made by some of my colleagues here. In terms of data monetization with the rest of the sector pushing clients to take higher bundles to monetize data in the case SwissCom which is charged by speed and you cannot - flat fee for data. I would like to understand your view on data monetization and how or whether you are seeing people just trading up for higher speeds because you are consuming more data, this means that they need more speed or what are the dynamics there?
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Maybe I will begin with monetization of data then Marc can take the ARPU topic for triple play. I am not convinced that this data monetization where we have pack so let's say 1 giga, 2 giga, 3 giga will work long term because in a world where everybody is using his Smartphone, with the speed of mobile networks is increasing very fast. The consumption of data will go out very fast and then I think it's a very short time you can really monetize - make a monetization on data packs and then you are in a flat rate world. That's a bit our view on this monetization of mobile data and therefore I think the logic of infinity is a good one and we will see how the market will develop.
A - Marc Werner
In vivo portfolio the cases that we already had triple play before that means the new portfolio must create because of the new TV 2.0 offering that means just and it's migration from existing triple play to new triple play and in this case I guess even once the ARPU upside is not so bad because it's not the new portfolio, it was just the new TV product in the portfolio. That's the case.
Bart Morselt
Trying to take somebody else.
Q - Michael Bishop
Thanks. It's Michael Bishop from RBC. Just a quick question on pricing. I guess historically you have always tended to create a slightly new product or bundle as a means of getting more out of the customers. And as you move forward and you offering flat rates on bundles, can you not think about more sort of nominal price increases each year which I guess might be more hidden from the consumer sort of letter and quite a few of the other markets like U.K. fixed line for instance is quite aggressive sort of 4% to 5% annual price increases and churn doesn't seem to have material increase? So it would be good to get your views on that.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
In a market like Switzerland it's extremely difficult to make price increases. You can only increase your output through delivering more value. That means increasing the value in the bundle. And yes that's a bit equation, that’s a bit of our strategy that's why we are pushing bundles. We try to bring in more value and to make an up selling. But just to increase the price is not, it doesn’t work.
Bart Morselt
You wanted the second follow-up Michael?
Q - Michael Bishop
I was just going to follow-up and say if you look at CableCom it seems to be their strategy particularly on the TV side and if you look at the results I don’t seem to have had any sort of increase in churn, so could you not, I mean, I appreciate perhaps on the mobile side is more difficult but on the fixed one side does seem to be all that doing if you don't follow? 
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Yes, CableCom is doing it in a clever way. I say for SwissCom it would be very hard to do such a thing. We have to deliver additional value.
Bart Morselt
Alright, second row.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. One first question on regulation after roaming. The situation where Switzerland is also in a strange situation, is the mobile termination what is - could we expect some change over there?
And second thing could you remind us, this is a small question for Mario, the remaining book value of Fastweb in your accounts? Thank you.

A- Mario Rossi
So mobile termination it's not a regulated business in Switzerland and we have quite, not a too high asymmetric in the mobile termination. So and there is always discussion where how much asymmetric will be. There are different let's say interest how this would be, but I think it will stay quite stable.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
It has around 20% asymmetry. It has been very stable over the past few years. While this 20% on the absolute level means there is a charge $0.08 per minute, we are charging $0.6.45. I think it's around 20% if you calculate well.
A- Mario Rossi
And book value of Fastweb in balance sheet is 2.8 billion Euro including a goodwill of 0.45 billion.
Bart Morselt
Alright. Next question.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Yes thanks. So just going back in terms of the quality scores you are flagging clearly your absolute scores have been probably number one in the last 5-7 years, but in the last survey we have seen the competitors also have improved their position in the market. It's important now that to understand clearly your premium quality driven by that network quality advantage that you were commanding is this really sustainable when the quality gap is converging, can you maintain that same quality premium in the market and specially in the business segment now given that you have such a dominant share and in the small pockets like SMEs can the competitors really have an impact and will you be really focusing in terms of market share in the business segment? Thanks.
A- Mario Rossi
Good. That’s clear, the quality advantage in the mobile network if our competitors are constantly investing big amounts in the network is becoming smaller. That's clear. But we will do all that we will have to network leadership, coverage is an important topic. Broadband also in the rural areas it's important in Switzerland. So, I think we will be able to have an advantage on the network quality side but it becomes smaller. But it's not the only differentiator we have. We invest in the customer service. We invest in our product and then that's normally in a mature market that you have to differentiate new ones on several levels. And I am convinced that we can keep the price premium.
Bart Morselt
Alright. I suggest we do the final question. And I see one hand, [indiscernible] go ahead.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. One question about your guidance of revenue it includes some new acquisitions of Veltigroup and public group. Could you give us a rough idea of what is the impact looking forward on the full year? Thank you.
A- Mario Rossi
The main part is the acquisition of Veltigroup, revenue is slightly over CHF 100 million that’s included.
A - Unidentified Company Representative
And there will be little bit additional public group.
A- Mario Rossi
Little bit of public group, but top of it will be already consolidated so it's not material. 
End of Q&A
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Alright. Before I close down, you start cheering and applauding one or two remarks. There is a little group of investors that is supposed to meet with Heinz Herren. Heinz Herren sitting in the back, head of networks for small group meeting which I suggest we’re starting around ten minutes. It's in the room Sidney on the first floor here. Okay. That is the first remark.
Secondly, we would like to invite you to have drinks and some bites finger food with us some of most of the people here will be around, so you can do a little bit of informal chatting.
And thirdly for those who would like to be on the bus to the airport, the shuttle goes at 6 PM sharp and if you need to go sooner, it's better to take a taxi, but the 6 PM shuttle leaves in front of the building here.
At this point is it from our side, I would like to thank you for your attention. And look forward to see you soon again if not here then on the phone. Thank you. Have a nice evening.
