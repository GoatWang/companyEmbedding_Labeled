	Otelco Reports Third Quarter Results


	ONEONTA, Ala., Nov. 4, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otelco Inc. (NASDAQ:OTEL), a wireline telecommunications services provider in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia and a provider of cloud hosting and managed services, today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2015. Key highlights for Otelco include:



	Total revenues of $17.9 million for third quarter 2015.


	Operating income of $4.9 million for third quarter 2015.


	Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) of $7.2 million for third quarter 2015.



	"Otelco's third quarter 2015 results produced Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million," said Rob Souza, President and Chief Executive Officer of Otelco. "The Company has been able to offset much of the revenue decline from fewer residential customers and lower intercarrier compensation with network cost and operational expense savings and increased data revenue to generate similar Adjusted EBITDA to the same quarter last year and second quarter of 2015. Revenue from internet, transmission services, cable and satellite and managed services is growing or unchanged from last year as we focus on the unregulated services we offer. We continue our active expense management process to closely control the underlying costs associated with these unregulated services as we grow this aspect of our business.


	"Our business access line equivalents grew just under 1.0% during third quarter and 1.6% this year and now represent nearly 55.0% of our total access line equivalents," continued Souza. "Our Hosted PBX and Classifax product offerings grew this quarter. Hosted PBX now accounts for nearly 36.0% of our CLEC retail voice lines.


	"During third quarter, our New England-based operation realigned its internal processes and work load with the appropriate personnel," Souza noted. "These changes eliminate a managerial layer and artificial barriers between work groups to improve our ability to fulfill new service requests and respond to existing customers' needs. In addition, a new Director of Marketing and Product Development joined Otelco responsible for all outbound marketing efforts, inbound lead generation and marketing and product development activities. The responsibilities of this position will expand to include the Alabama and Missouri Divisions. A single well-coordinated marketing and product approach will provide important operational benefits to the entire company.


	"By the end of 2015, Otelco expects to have reduced our senior debt by over $60 million from the level prior to restructuring," added Souza. "Otelco continues to focus on the reduction of its long-term debt. At the end of third quarter, the debt was $102.0 million with our cash balance of $5.9 million for net debt of $96.1 million. The lower level of debt has also significantly reduced our cash interest expense."

	Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and certain other fees, expenses or non-cash charges reducing consolidated net income. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). While providing useful information, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a tool to analyze the Company on the basis of operating performance and leverage. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the Company's credit facility and certain of the covenants contained therein. The Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

	FINANCIAL DISCUSSION FOR THIRD QUARTER 2015:





	Revenues




	Total revenues decreased 3.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $17.9 million from $18.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014.  The majority of the decrease is due to the decline in RLEC residential access line equivalents and the FCC's Intercarrier Compensation reform order (the "FCC's order"). The table below provides the components of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014.

	Local services

	revenue decreased 6.5% in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, to $6.3 million from $6.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Growth in Hosted PBX revenue of $0.1 million was more than offset by the decline in RLEC residential voice access lines and the impact of the FCC's order which reduces or eliminates intrastate and local cellular revenue which accounted for a decrease of $0.3 million. A portion of the RLEC decrease is recovered through the Connect America Fund which is categorized as network access revenue. The decline in long distance, directory and special revenue, plus one-time fiber installation revenue in 2014, accounted for a decrease of $0.2 million.

	Network access

	revenue decreased 4.4% in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, to $5.6 million from $5.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Switched access, including projected cost study adjustments increased by $0.2 million. This increase was more than offset by lower state and special access charges of $0.3 million and lower Connect America Fund of $0.1 million.

	Internet

	revenue increased 1.8% to just over $3.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, from just under $3.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, primarily from equipment rental fees.

	Transport services

	revenue increased 2.6% to just under $1.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 from just over $1.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, from wide-area network and wholesale transport growth.

	Cable, IP and satellite television

	revenue decreased 0.9% to remain at just under $0.7 million in both the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Increases in pay-per-view revenue were more than offset by cable subscriber attrition.

	Cloud hosting and managed services

	revenue increased 13.1% to remain at just over $0.2 million in both the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and the quarter ended September 30, 2014.




	Operating Expenses




	Operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2015, decreased 6.2% to $12.9 million from $13.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014.

	Cost of services

	decreased 5.3% to $8.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, from $8.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Network circuit and toll costs decreased $0.4 million reflecting network efficiencies and customer service, sales and plant operations expense decreased $0.1 million as a result of operational reductions implemented over the past year.

	Selling, general and administrative


	expenses

	decreased 3.7% to $2.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, from $2.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. The decrease reflected a reduction in earn-out stock compensation of $0.1 million, which has no impact on Adjusted EBITDA.

	Depreciation and amortization

	decreased 12.1% to $2.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, from $2.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Depreciation decreased by $0.1 million in Missouri and by $0.1 million in the CLEC. The amortization of other intangible assets decreased $0.1 million.




	Interest Expense and Other Income/Expense




	Interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2015, decreased 10.1% to $2.0 million from $2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014. While the interest rate remained constant, the lower outstanding loan principal accounted for the decrease. In third quarter 2014, the Company had $0.3 million in securities expense (which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA) for which there was no comparable expense in third quarter 2015.




	Adjusted EBITDA




	Based on the changes noted above, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by less than $0.1 million to be $7.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. Stock-based compensation and other excluded expenses are added back in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. See financial tables for a reconciliation of third quarter 2014 and 2015 Adjusted EBITDA to net income.




	Balance Sheet

 ONEONTA, Ala., May 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otelco Inc. (NASDAQ:OTEL), a wireline telecommunications, cloud hosting and managed services provider in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Key highlights for Otelco include:  Total revenues of $17.4 million for first quarter 2017. Operating income of $5.0 million for first quarter 2017. Net income of $1.6 million for first quarter 2017. Consolidated EBITDA (as defined below) of $7.2 million for first quarter 2017.  During first quarter 2017, Otelco's operating income increased by $0.3 million to $5.0 million. The Company began receiving the FCC's A-CAM payments in the five states where the program is applicable to the Company. The program provides a known level of support for ten years, which is being used to enhance and build out the Company's broadband network to provide increased speed and accessibility to customers. The new model-based support plus higher CAF funding provided an increase of approximately $0.4 million in revenue for the quarter compared with the revenue it replaced in 2016. The program funding reduced the decline in revenue to $0.1 million for first quarter 2017 when compared to first quarter 2016. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 declined by $0.1 million and Consolidated EBITDA declined by $0.4 million from the same period in 2016. The decline in residential voice service, the increase in interest costs associated with the Company's credit agreements, and the reduction in annual CoBank dividends were partially offset by the increase in A-CAM and CAF revenue. In March, Otelco implemented a long-term fiber IRU transport contract with a national carrier and signed an additional dark-fiber contract with another carrier that will begin service in June. In addition, the Company has signed fiber leases to serve two cell towers with service to begin in second quarter. On April 1, 2017, the Company successfully connected over 1,000 voice and data access lines to its network under a multi-year contract with the community of Leverett, Massachusetts.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Otelco Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
BY GlobeNewswire— 5:00 PM ET 08/01/2017


ONEONTA, Ala., Aug.  01, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otelco Inc. (OTEL) , a wireline telecommunications, cloud hosting and managed services provider in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia, today announced results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2017. Key highlights for Otelco (OTEL) include:
Total revenues of $17.4 million for second quarter 2017.Operating income of $5.1 million for second quarter 2017.Net income of $1.5 million for second quarter 2017.Consolidated EBITDA (as defined below) of $7.0 million for second quarter 2017. During second quarter 2017, Otelco’s operating income increased by $0.2 million to $5.1 million when compared to the same period last year. As previously reported, the Company began receiving revenue during the first quarter from the FCC’s Alternative Connect America Model (or “ACAM”) program in the five states where the program is applicable, which is the primary factor driving revenue improvement during second quarter. The program provides a known level of support for ten years to enhance and build out the Company’s broadband network to provide increased speed and accessibility to customers. The new model-based support plus higher Connect America Fund (or “CAF”) funding provides an increase of approximately $0.4 million in revenue each quarter this year when compared with the revenue it replaced in 2016. As a result, the Company reported an increase of $0.2 million in total revenue for second quarter 2017 compared with second quarter 2016 and up slightly from first quarter 2017. Net income for the second quarter of 2017 increased by $0.2 million, compared to the same period in 2016. The decline in residential RLEC voice service was more than offset by the decrease in interest costs associated with the Company’s credit agreements, and the increase in ACAM and CAF revenue. Consolidated EBITDA declined by less than $0.1 million. The Company continues to make significant progress in implementing its strategic goals. The first phase of ACAM fiber-to-the-home projects in Missouri, Maine and Alabama totaling $2.4 million are underway with completion of this work expected in the fourth quarter of 2017. The projects will drive fiber deeper into Otelco’s network and provide customers the opportunity to subscribe to greater bandwidth offerings and benefit from enhanced service. Today, the Company has over 1,600 fiber route miles in its current network. On April 1, 2017, the Company successfully connected over 1,000 voice and data access lines to its network under a multi-year contract with the community of Leverett, Massachusetts. Discussions continue with several communities in Massachusetts on similar projects. The work on consolidating and streamlining our business operations continues to move forward. The Company is making significant progress in replacing its billing and operations systems with a common platform across its entire operation. “We are adjusting our current bill cycles on October 1, 2017, to common dates in preparation for the system conversion in 2018,” noted Rob Souza, President and Chief Executive Officer of Otelco (OTEL). “Carrier billing is expected to begin converting to the new system during first quarter 2018 with end-user billing to follow in second quarter 2018. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical teams are already functioning on a company-wide basis in advance of the conversion to effectively plan for the enhanced customer service and improved efficiency provided by the consolidated system.” Cash grew from $10.5 million at the end of 2016 to $11.3 million at June 30, 2017. The growth in cash reflects the continuing strength of the Company’s operations. In addition to its scheduled quarterly $1.0 million principal payment on its senior credit facility, Otelco (OTEL) is today making a $3.0 million additional principal payment to further reduce its senior debt as part of its plan to reduce leverage toward current industry norms. The Company’s total leverage ratio, net of cash, at June 30, 2017, as defined and calculated below, was 2.95.  “In the fall of 2016, we announced the engagement of The Bank Street Group LLC to explore the Company’s strategic alternatives,” added Souza. “While the Company will continue to restrict public comments on the process, discussions are ongoing with a number of entities who have been engaged in reviewing both the Company’s performance and its future possibilities. The discussions are consistent with other telecommunications industry announcements within the broadly defined telecom market.” However, there can be no assurance that any transactions will occur as a result of these discussions.   Second Quarter 2017 Financial Summary (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)     Three Months Ended June 30, Change    2017   2016  Amount Percent  Revenues$17,406  $17,232  $174   1.0 % Operating income$5,053  $4,899  $154   3.1 % Interest expense$(2,571) $(2,721) $(150)  (5.5)% Net income available to stockholders$1,536  $1,324  $212   16.0 % Basic net income per share$0.46  $0.40  $0.06   15.0 % Diluted net income per share$0.45  $0.39  $0.06   15.4 %            Consolidated EBITDA(1)$7,005  $7,053  $(48)  (0.7)% Capital expenditures$2,488  $1,509  $979   64.9 %                         Six Months Ended June 30, Change    2017   2016  Amount Percent  Revenues$34,786  $34,722  $64   0.2 % Operating income$10,074  $9,645  $429   4.4 % Interest expense$(5,182) $(5,203) $(21)  (0.4)% Net income$3,144  $3,074  $70   2.3 % Net income per share$0.94  $0.94  $-   - % Diluted net income per share$0.91  $0.91  $-   - %            Consolidated EBITDA(1)$14,203  $14,680  $(477)  (3.2)% Capital expenditures$3,758  $2,215  $1,543   69.7 %                       Reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA(1) to Net Income        Twelve Months  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Ended June 30,   2017   2016   2017   2016  2017Net income$1,536  $1,324  $3,144  $3,074  $5,215Add:Depreciation 1,741   1,792   3,479   3,571   7,046 Interest expense less interest income 2,260   2,400   4,562   4,439   9,359 Interest expense - amortized loan cost 311   321   620   764   1,254 Income tax expense 946   858   1,951   1,991   3,617 Amortization - intangibles 101   259   202   518   570 Loan fees 39   40   79   124   158 Stock-based compensation (earn-out) -   (78)  -   -   - Stock-based compensation (senior management) 71   137   166   199   382Consolidated EBITDA(1)$7,005  $7,053  $14,203  $14,680  $27,601            (1) Consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus consolidated net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and certain other fees, expenses and non-cash charges reducing consolidated net income. Consolidated EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Consolidated EBITDA corresponds to the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in the Company’s credit facilities. The lenders under the Company’s credit facilities utilize this measure to determine compliance with credit facility requirements. The Company uses Consolidated EBITDA as an operational performance measurement to focus attention on the operational generation of cash, which is used for reinvestment into the business; to repay its debt and to pay interest on its debt; to pay income taxes; and for other corporate requirements. The Company reports Consolidated EBITDA to allow current and potential investors to understand this performance metric and because the Company believes that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance, including the Company’s ability to generate earnings sufficient to service its debt, and enhance understanding of the Company’s financial performance and highlight operational trends. However, Consolidated EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of Consolidated EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.     Otelco Inc.

The Company uses the ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months as an operational performance measurement. Such ratio is a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company reports such ratio to allow current and potential investors to understand this performance metric and because the Company believes that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance, including the Company’s ability to generate earnings sufficient to service its debt, and enhance understanding of the Company’s financial performance and highlight operational trends. However, such ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of such ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled ratios used by other companies.

The increase in network access associated with the FCC’s ACAM program, internet, video and security revenue were partially offset by the decrease in local service revenue associated with residential RLEC access line equivalents. The table below provides the components of the Company’s revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016.    Three Months Ended June 30, Change    2017 2016 Amount Percent                      (dollars in thousands)    Local services$5,762 $5,849 $(87) (1.5)% Network access 5,604  5,345  259  4.8 % Internet 3,958  3,879  79  2.0 % Transport services 1,168  1,230  (62) (5.0)% Video and security 747  718  29  4.0 % Managed services 167  211  (44) (20.9)% Total$17,406 $17,232 $174  1.0 %            Local services revenue decreased 1.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to slightly less than $5.8 million from slightly more than $5.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decline in RLEC residential voice access lines and related revenue, such as long distance, accounted for a decrease of $0.3 million. A portion of the RLEC decrease is recovered through the CAF, which is categorized as interstate access revenue. The decline in RLEC residential voice access revenue was partially offset by an increase in HPBX and fiber revenue of $0.2 million. Network access revenue increased 4.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to $5.6 million from $5.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The initial ACAM revenue and transition payments and CAF revenue increased $2.1 million. A one-time settlement accounted for an increase of $0.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in interstate access, including universal service funding. End-user based fees decreased $0.2 million and special access charges decreased by $0.2 million. Internet revenue increased 2.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to $4.0 million from $3.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Increased data speeds and equipment rental fees accounted for the increase in revenue. Transport services revenue decreased 5.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to just under $1.2 million from just over $1.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, reflecting customer churn and market pricing. Video and security revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased 4.0% from the three months ended June 30, 2016, to remain at $0.7 million in both periods reflecting increases in IPTV and security revenue. Managed services revenue decreased 20.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to just under $0.2 million from just over $0.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, reflecting a decrease in professional services revenue. Operating Expenses Operating expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased 0.2% to $12.4 million from $12.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Cost of services increased 2.1% to just over $8.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, from just under $7.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Network and other operations expense increased just over $0.1 million and pole rental expense increased by $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in customer service and sales costs. Circuit, access, internet and cable costs were unchanged. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.5% to $2.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, from $2.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was the result of a transition from the stock-based senior management bonus plan, which had been in place for three years, to a cash-based bonus plan for 2017. Depreciation and amortization decreased 10.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to $1.8 million from $2.1 million in three months ended June 30, 2016. The amortization of the telephone plant adjustment decreased $0.1 million. New England RLEC depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets decreased $0.1 million, driven primarily by the end of amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions. Operating Income Operating income in the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased 3.1% to $5.1 million from $4.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily related to the increase in revenue associated with the FCC’s A-CAM program during second quarter 2017. Interest Expense Interest expense in the three months ended June 30, 2017, decreased 5.5% to $2.6 million from $2.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The lower outstanding balance on the senior credit facility accounted for the decrease. The Company has repaid $8.1 million of principal since it funded new senior and subordinated credit facilities in February 2016. The credit facilities mature in 2021. Net Income Reflecting the changes noted above, net income increased $0.2 million to $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, when compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily driven by new ACAM revenue. Consolidated EBITDA Based on the changes noted above, Consolidated EBITDA decreased by less than $0.1 million to $7.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, when compared to just under $7.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Consolidated EBITDA was $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, including $0.2 million in annual CoBank dividends. Stock-based compensation and other excluded expenses are added back in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA. See financial tables for a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to net income. Balance Sheet As of June 30, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $11.3 million compared to $10.5 million at the end of 2016. The growth in cash reflects the continuing strength of the Company’s operations. During second quarter 2017, the Company reduced its senior credit facility balance to $76.9 million through $1.0 million in scheduled principal payments. Total notes payable as of June 30, 2017, was $92.6 million. The $5.0 million revolver remains undrawn. The Company made an additional prepayment of $3.0 million today on its senior credit facility as part of its strategy to reduce its leverage. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $1.5 million in the same period in 2016. The buildout requirements of the ACAM program and the Company’s plans to convert its billing and operations systems to a single platform are primarily responsible for this increase. The Company has amended its credit facility to allow for the potential increase in capital expenditures to $8.5 million and $7.5 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
