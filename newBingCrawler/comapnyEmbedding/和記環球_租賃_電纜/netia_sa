								 NETIA Products at IBC2015						


At IBC2015, NETIA will highlight new product features that enhance the flexibility and reliability of multichannel radio playout and new capabilities that enrich multimedia production, as well as mobile and remote production workflows. NETIA will also demonstrate its ability to integrate complex production ecosystems and simplify the publishing of content and data to the second screen.
NEW AirPlayList 2.0 Module for the NETIA Media Assist Software Suite
The NETIA Media Assist software suite empowers users to manage all types of content — in any format, on any platform — from anywhere and at any time. The new AirPlayList 2.0 module facilitates automated playout of multiple radio channels simultaneously and with guaranteed redundancy. Because the module is AES67- and audio-over-IP-compliant, users can broadcast either from a traditional physical sound card or using IP-based virtual drivers. Built on a distributed architecture, the AirPlayList 2.0 module augments the overall reliability and robustness of playout. In high-demand scenarios, the AirPlayList 2.0 user interface supports centralized control and monitoring of many different playout systems installed across different servers. Users can access and broadcast media or channels located within separate databases rather than one central database. With the module’s Web-based interface, remote users can easily access the module to monitor or supervise playout on each channel and check the status of media. To ensure high availability of media, the AirPlayList 2.0 module offers users the choice of one-to-one redundancy or a one-to-N option, in which a dedicated pool of servers ensures that even in the event of a disaster, a secondary server can recover media and ensure an uninterrupted broadcast.
Audiovisual Media Management With Radio-Assist™ Radio Automation
NETIA will feature the integration of its multiple-device interface for audiovisual media management with its well-established Radio-Assist™ radio automation module via a secure, cross-platform, Web-based interface. The portable, lightweight Web-based interface not only enables convenient content editing and repurposing of professional branded multimedia, but also automates publishing to any platform. With this powerful tool for multimedia content creation, journalists and field staff can use virtually any mobile device (laptop, tablet, or smartphone) and operating system (iOS, Windows®, and Android™) to gain remote access to the content and subsequently search, browse, ingest, and edit video and/or audio; segment a video; and then export and publish the media on any CDN platform.

At IBC2016, NETIA will showcase the full NETIA Media Assist digital software suite, which includes radio automation (production, newsroom, scheduling, and playout modules), media asset management, and workflow management solutions.
NETIA Media Assist Software Suite – a Hub for Media Assets
In a news environment, the NETIA Media Assist software suite acts as a multimedia hub for content in any format, including audio, video, text, or images. The cloud-ready system enables radio stations to deploy their back-office applications in a dedicated SAN or host them securely outside the station’s premises. By offering a safe and managed access to outside entities, the station can foster cooperation and exchange with its affiliates and partner organizations.
At IBC2016, NETIA will showcase a new monitoring tool for Media Assist, giving radio staff a single easy-to-use interface for managing and optimizing multisite workflows. Staff can now monitor priority levels on all launched processes to help minimize their impact on bandwidth, while facilitating content delivery within the group and increasing time-to-air ratios. The powerful API within Media Assist enables interoperability and integration of multiple business- and public-facing systems. In addition, broadcasters can set up several instances of the NETIA Workflow Engine to handle parallel tasks such as transcoding and process even more content during peak news periods. NETIA’s special focus on virtualization means that demanding computational tasks, together with server components, can run in a virtualized infrastructure with minimal configuration stored on clients and minimum effect on users.

Recognized with a Best of Show Award at IBC2015 by Radio World International, the module streamlines and simplifies the playout workflow to make it easier than ever to launch and maintain new Web radio services.The AirPlayList 2.0 module provides targeted encoding of audio streams for CDNs such as Shoutcast and Icecast. In addition to enabling Web radio playout, it also leverages datacasting functionality from the Media Assist AirPush module to deliver associated metadata, including information about streamed content that enriches the consumer experience.Because the module is audio-over-IP-compliant, users can broadcast either from a traditional physical sound card or using IP-based virtual drivers. The new module's intuitive Web-based interface allows users to check the status of media and enables fast, convenient monitoring of playout on each channel. The integration of VST audio processing plugins gives users even greater control over the sound consistency and loudness of each broadcast item.Photo Link: www.wallstcom.com/NETIA/NETIA_AirPlayList-2.0-Audio-Pilot.pngPhoto Caption: NETIA AirPlayList 2.0 Audio PilotPhoto Link: www.wallstcom.com/NETIA/NETIA_AirPlayList-2.0-Web-Based-Monitoring.pngPhoto Caption: NETIA AirPlayList 2.0 Web-Based MonitoringEnhanced NETIA Media Assist Software SuiteThe NETIA Media Assist software suite unites the unique functionality of NETIA's proven audio automation and video management products with an optimized search engine to provide a robust multimedia asset management system with a full complement of production tools.

NETIA 
Exhibiting With Broadcast Communications International (BCI), Stand 5M7 - 05
May 31 - June 3, Singapore
AirPlayList 2.0 Module for the NETIA Media Assist Software Suite
At BroadcastAsia2016, NETIA will showcase its acclaimed AirPlayList 2.0 module, fully integrated into the NETIA Media Assist software suite to facilitate automated playout of multiple radio channels simultaneously and with guaranteed redundancy. Recognized with a Best of Show Award at IBC2015 by Radio World International, the module streamlines and simplifies the playout workflow to make it easier than ever to launch and maintain new Web radio services.
The AirPlayList 2.0 module provides targeted encoding of audio streams for CDNs such as Shoutcast and Icecast. In addition to enabling Web radio playout, it also leverages datacasting functionality from the Media Assist AirPush module to deliver associated metadata, including information about streamed content that enriches the consumer experience.
Because the module is audio-over-IP-compliant, users can broadcast either from a traditional physical sound card or using IP-based virtual drivers. The new module's intuitive Web-based interface allows users to check the status of media and enables fast, convenient monitoring of playout on each channel. The integration of VST audio processing plugins gives users even greater control over the sound consistency and loudness of each broadcast item.

Enhanced NETIA Media Assist Software Suite
The NETIA Media Assist software suite unites the unique functionality of NETIA's proven audio automation and video management products with an optimized search engine to provide a robust multimedia asset management system with a full complement of production tools. The NETIA solution enables agencies to capture, record, monitor, index, and then search sensitive audio or video assets, and a new logging feature adds further utility in applications requiring close review of recorded events.
 
Working with Media Assist, users can manage virtually any type of content, in any format. To enable convenient use across an organization, Media Assist provides both a rich-client platform and a Web-based interface that can be displayed with a simple Internet browser. Both GUIs have been designed to assure effective ergonomics. The option of working through a browser-based interface gives authorized users secure remote access, allowing them to access, browse, edit, or archive content.
Media Assist is based on a service-oriented architecture that offers many additional advantages over a client-server computing model. Key benefits to operations include increased modularity, optimal scalability, and high availability through the improvement or addition of services, as well as third-party connectivity through Web services, with a guaranteed high level of security.
The new on-demand media logging feature within Media Assist targets users who need a simple solution for simultaneous capture and review of numerous audio and video feeds, whether from a broadcast, public debate, internal meeting, or other production. Valuable in applications ranging from legal review to security, this feature makes it possible to perform high-volume real-time recording and monitoring locally through the rich-client platform or from anywhere via the software's Web-based interface. Recorded content can be indexed and enriched with additional metadata to speed retrieval and review. Because it is fully IP-based, this feature requires no additional infrastructure or hardware.
Company Quote:
"We're pleased to be teaming with our partner BCI at BroadcastAsia2016 to showcase the award-winning AirPlayList 2.0 module for NETIA Media Assist, as well as a valuable new logging feature within Media Assist. The AirPlayList 2.0 module makes the launch and operation of multiple broadcast or Web radio channels incredibly easy and economical by automating key elements of playout. As a result, users can very quickly and affordably address consumers' ever-increasing demand for additional services and content."
-- Peter Fong, Head of Sales, Asia-Pacific Region, at NETIA
