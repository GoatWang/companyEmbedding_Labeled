 Sustaining momentum of its prepaid business, Globe Telecom beefs up its product portfolio by enhancing its most availed prepaid promo GoUNLI25 with additional access to social networking and search sites for the same price.With the new GoUNLI25, prepaid subscribers can send unlimited texts and make unlimited calls to Globe/TM, and now get free access to Facebook plus another free internet site or app of their choice still for P25 valid for 1 day.Subscribers can choose from any of six top social and search sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Google, Yahoo, Viber or Foursquare to boost their new GoUNLI25 promo bundle, allowing them to tweet, post photos, search the Web, send stickers and emoticons, and check-in with no Wi-Fi or additional data charges needed. To register to the new GoUNLI25, subscribers can dial *143#, select GoSakto, select New GoUnli25, choose Select your free site, and then select Subscribe Now. Prepaid subscribers can also register to the new GoUNLI25 using the GoSAKTO app now available in iOS and Android-powered devices, giving users a digital experience on mobile.“As Globe Prepaid moves into serving the youth and their digital lifestyle, we take a leap into understanding that their social networks are now an extension of their lives,” shares Issa Cabreira, Vice President for Globe Prepaid Business. “This is the inspiration behind the new GoUNLI25, which offers unlimited calls and texts to Globe/TM and now unlimited Facebook, and additional free access to the social networking or search site of choice without the need for Wi-Fi, providing the youth with more ways to explore and to stay connected online anytime, anywhere, without hurting their pockets. With the new GoUNLI25, we help the youth and the young at heart create a wonderful digital world that they can enjoy.”According to TNS’ Mobile Life 2013, an annual study on behaviors of mobile users from 40 countries including the Philippines which involved 500 Metro Manila respondents aged 16-60, about 45% browse the internet from 32% in 2012 while 44% are accessing their social networking sites compared to 34% a year ago.To know more about the new GoUnli25, visit www.globe.com.ph/gounli25.

We provide cellular, broadband and mobile data services by focusing on enriching our content offerings
        amid customers' growing preference for multimedia platforms across multiple screens and devices. We believe companies that provide the best customer experience win. This is the overarching strategy of Globe. It is the reason why we continue making a massive shift towards becoming a company that gives our customers the delightful experience they deserve. This shift started in 2013 and went full scale in 2014 when we embarked on a customer experience transformation
        program called Delivering the Next Act (DNA). In 2015, we expanded this to further embed the culture of service in every Globe employee, including all frontliners. In this program, we further empowered our customers in resolving their concerns
        through our own 150,000-strong Globe Community. More importantly, we began to strengthen partnerships and embed our service culture to our vendor partners. This enabled us to combine our expertise in our respective areas and come up with improvements
        that spelled the difference in customer experience. Supported by approximately 6,800 employees; with 1.08 million retailers, distributors, suppliers, and business partners nationwide, serving more than 55 million customers, we operate one of the largest, most technologically advanced, and robust mobile,
        fixed line and broadband networks in the country, providing reliable communications services to individual customers, small and medium-sized businesses, and corporate and enterprise clients. Our principal shareholders are Ayala Corporation and Singtel, both industry
        leaders in their respective countries and in the region. We are a member of Bridge Alliance, Asia Pacific's leading mobile alliance of 36 mobile carriers with a combined customer base of over 680 million. Globe operates internationally with presence
        in over ten countries and 736 roaming partners. Our Purpose VISION  We see a Philippines where families' dreams come true, businesses flourish, and the nation is admired. MISSION  We create wonderful experiences for people to have choices, overcome challenges, and discover new ways to enjoy life.
         In everything we do... We treat people right to create a Globe of good. CORE VALUES  And we do this the Globe way... We put customers first.
         We value people and together, we make the difference.
         We act with integrity.
         We care like an owner.
         We keep things simple.
         We move fast, we are better, every day. This keeps our Circle of Happiness spinning... Employees feel empowered and find meaning at work. Customers feel special and valued. Shareholders feel confident and rewarded.   'Purpose' Video  Globe has risen to become the number one mobile brand in the Philippines, driving highly customer-centric value with keen focus on enriching Filipino lives in the digital age. True to our nature of innovation and going beyond achieving business
        success, Globe sought and found a purpose larger than itself to serve customers more meaningfully and to "create a Globe of good."
          Our 'Purpose' video features our President and CEO, Ernest Cu, pointing out the relevance and essence of 'Purpose' in carrying out the company's vision, mission, and core values. What follows is profound and a sincere reflection on what it means to be a truly Purpose-led organization that casts positive and sustainable impact on society.    Corporate Objectives  In 2015, Globe aimed to disrupt the telco arena through transformative customer experiences, from enhancement in our self-service channels to expansion of the Globe GEN3 stores that deliver relevant value. GEN3 stores changed the seemingly transactional
        mobile retail landscape into a hub that not only features the latest Globe offerings, but also an interactive space for customers to be fully immersed in the different facts of digital lifestyle. We are set to develop and launch more of these
        stores nationwide to bring the wonderful experience of Globe to more Filipinos in 2016. We continue to envision a strong business by maximizing our core revenue and optimizing profitability. To create a wonderful world for our people, business,
        and nation, we will also continue to collaborate with partners and develop infrastructure to optimize the quality of our services and enhance the coverage of our network. These may include, but are not limited to, building cell sites, establishing
        fiber-optic technology in cities and subdivisions around the country, and launching a new product or service in 2016.
