TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoftBank Group Corp. (“SBG”) today announced that it will form SoftBank 
      Vision Fund (tentative name) (the “Fund”). The Fund intends to make 
      investments in the technology sector globally. The Fund will be managed 
      in the United Kingdom by a subsidiary of SBG and will deploy capital 
      from SBG and investment partners. The Fund will aim to be one of the 
      world’s largest of its kind*.
    


      SBG expects to invest at least USD 25 billion over the next 5 years. SBG 
      has concluded a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) on 
      October 12, 2016 with the Public Investment Fund of the Kingdom of Saudi 
      Arabia (“PIF”), under which PIF will consider investing in the Fund and 
      becoming the lead investment partner, with the potential investment size 
      of up to USD 45 billion over the next five years. In addition, a few 
      large global investors are in active dialogue to join SBG and PIF to 
      participate in this Fund. The overall potential size of the Fund can go 
      up to USD 100 billion.
    

      SBG will use its deep operational expertise and network of portfolio 
      companies in order to add value to the Fund’s investments.
    

      His Royal Highness, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Chairman of 
      PIF, commented as follows:“The Public Investment Fund is focused 
      on achieving attractive long-term financial returns from its investments 
      at home and abroad, as well as supporting the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 
      strategy to develop a diversified economy. We are delighted to sign this 
      MOU with SBG given the long history, established industry relationships 
      and strong investment performance of SBG and Masayoshi Son.”
    

      Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., commented on the 
      establishment of the Fund as follows:“With the establishment of 
      the SoftBank Vision Fund, we will be able to step up investments in 
      technology companies globally. Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision 
      Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector. We will 
      further accelerate the Information Revolution by contributing to its 
      development.”
    

      Rajeev Misra, Head of Strategic Finance, SoftBank Group, is leading the 
      Fund project for SBG. SBG has engaged former Deutsche banker Nizar 
      Al-Bassam and ex-Goldman partner Dalinc Ariburnu for the project. PIF 
      also had its own team of experts engaged.
    

About the Public Investment Fund (PIF)


      The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund was established in 1971 to 
      provide financing support for projects of strategic significance to the 
      national economy, and its role has evolved to incorporate a number of 
      different areas. These include holding and managing the government’s 
      stakes in some of Saudi Arabia’s largest and most important blue chip 
      companies. PIF has also set up and managed a number of companies to 
      support innovation, diversification and non-oil sector development 
      within the Kingdom. Furthermore, the institution has been responsible 
      for holding and managing the government’s stake in bilateral and 
      multilateral companies abroad as well as investing selectively in a 
      range of other asset classes internationally.
    

      PIF has gone through major restructuring, and had supervision moved from 
      under the Ministry of Finance to the Council of Economic and Development 
      Affairs, led by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin 
      Abdulaziz, since March 2015. PIF, under the leadership of His Royal 
      Highness, has revised its long term investment strategy to coincide with 
      the country’s Vision 2030.

Business units[edit]
SoftBank's corporate profile includes various other companies such as Japanese broadband company SoftBank BB, data center company IDC Frontier, gaming company GungHo Online Entertainment, and the publishing company SB Creative. SBI Group is a Japanese financial services company that began in 1999 as a branch of SoftBank.[41] Ymobile Corporation is another telecommunications subsidiary of SoftBank, established in 2014.

Additionally, it has various partnerships in Japanese subsidiaries of foreign companies such as Yahoo! (which has resulted in Yahoo! Japan), E-Trade, Ustream.tv, EF Education First and Morningstar. It also has stakes in Alibaba Group and Sprint Corporation.
SoftBank Corp.[edit]
SoftBank Corp. (ソフトバンク株式会社, Sofutobanku Kabushikigaisha) is SoftBank's telecommunications subsidiary, providing both mobile and fixed-line services. It was previously called SoftBank Mobile until July 2015 with the Group's merger of SoftBank BB Corp., SoftBank Telecom Corp. and Ymobile Corporation to reflect its new status of providing fixed-line and ISP operations.[43]
J-PHONE[edit]

The company was founded in 1981 as the mobile phone division of Japan Telecom under the name Digital Phone (デジタルホン). J-PHONE Co., Ltd. (J-フォン) was formed in 1999 by the merging of Digital Phone Group (DPG, 3 local companies) and Digital TU-KA Group (DTG, 6 local companies, not to be confused with TU-KA). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%.
J-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by continuously introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker for PDC, SkyMelody ringtone download, the famous Sha-Mail picture mail introduced on the basis of camera phones developed by SHARP, the mobile multimedia data service J-Sky modeled after NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, and advanced Java services based on JSCL, modeled after NTT DoCoMo's DoJa based i-appli.
Vodafone[edit]
In October 2001, the British mobile phone group Vodafone increased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On October 1, 2003, the name of the company and the service brand was officially changed to Vodafone, with the division called Vodafone K.K. or Vodafone Japan. The growth and success of the company during this period is due in large part to then president Bill Morrow.[44]
However, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, au by KDDI gained 163,700, and Willcom gained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo's FOMA 3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone cut back investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers, and by end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen by 103,100 to 14.996 million, while during the same period NTT DoCoMo had gained 1.65 million customers and KDDI/AU had gained 1.82 million customers. At the end of October 2005, NTT DoCoMo had 17.6 million 3G customers, KDDI/AU had 19.8 million 3G customers, and Vodafone-Japan had 1.9 million 3G customers, i.e. Vodafone-Japan gained about 4.8% of Japan's 3G market.
Vodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky to Vodafone live!, and used J-Sky's principles and technologies and business models to introduce the WAP-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. Thus Vodafone live! has its origin in J-Phone's J-Sky. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By end of October 2005 the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000 to 12,769,600.
In March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers, as Japanese users tend to have preferences not seen in other markets. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface, and did not have as many features as competing companies. This led to the loss of more customers and Vodafone's decision that the market was no longer profitable.

On March 17, 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell its holding of Vodafone Japan (Vodafone K.K.) to SoftBank for about 1.75 trillion Japanese yen (approximately US$15.1 billion). On April 14, 2006, SoftBank and Vodafone K. K. jointly announced, that the name of the company will be changed to a "new, easy-to-understand and familiar" company name and brand. It was announced in a press conference on May 18, 2006, that the new name would be "SoftBank Mobile Corp.", effective October 1, 2006. SoftBank started the rebranding around June 14, 2006.
On June 4, 2008, SoftBank Mobile announced partnership with Apple and brought the iPhone (3G) to Japan later in 2008.[45] SoftBank Mobile was the only official carrier of the iPhone in Japan until the release of iPhone 4S in 2011 when it became available on au by KDDI as well.[46]
Technology[edit]
SoftBank Corp.'s mobile network operates W-CDMA (UMTS 3G) network ("SoftBank 3G"). SoftBank's 3G network is compatible with UMTS and supports transparent global roaming for existing UMTS subscribers from other countries. SoftBank 4G uses TD-LTE / LTE. SoftBank offers 4G speeds of more than 110 Mbit/s. SoftBank Wi-Fi Spots are available almost everywhere in Japan.

Marketing[edit]
Since May 2006, SoftBank's marketing and commercials have principally revolved around "Otosan sujan karki", the canine patriarch of the otherwise human "Shirason, "Kaito" family.[49] "Otosan" translates to father, and the character, a Hokkaido dog, indeed acts as the father of the family, along with the son "Kojiro" (starred by Dante Carver), mom "Masako", and daughter "Aya".[50] The advertising series proved to be highly popular: CM Research Center ranked the Otousan adverts as the most popular in Japan between 2007 and 2012, based on monthly surveys of 3,000 randomly selected adults in Japan.[51][52]
Baby bonus[edit]
Softbank, along with some other companies in Japan,[53] offer a baby bonus for employees who have children. The payments range from US$400 for a first child to US$40,000 for a fifth child.[54][55]
