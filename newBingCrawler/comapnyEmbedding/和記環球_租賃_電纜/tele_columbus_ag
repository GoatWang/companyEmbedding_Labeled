Berlin, 5 December 2016. Tele Columbus, Germany's third-largest cable operator, will launch its new advanceTV product on 16 January 2017. It offers its  customers a leapfrog entertainment platform providing linear and video-on-demand content anytime on the TV set and on mobile devices in the household in best quality. In conjunction with a top cable receiver and an intuitive user interface setting new benchmarks, advanceTV combines linear television, video content from the Internet, personal recordings, the maxdome flat-rate and Hollywood blockbusters on-demand with further smart TV apps on a unique platform.


        From 16 January 2017, all new Premium TV customers of Tele Columbus can enjoy the most popular free-TV and pay-TV channels, the latest Hollywood blockbusters on-demand from the advanceTV video library as well as their favourite series and movies with the bundle product HD maxdome plus or the additional subscription option maxdome flat. The films in the advanceTV movie library are provided almost at the same time as their DVD/Blu-ray release. Video-on-demand content acquired through advanceTV is even accessible outside the home via any internet connection such as public hotspots or mobile networks. The advanceTV platform sets another milestone in the transition of Tele Columbus from a pure cable player to a fully integrated multimedia operator as part of its current strategy.
      

About Tele Columbus
        The SDAX listed Tele Columbus Group is Germany's third largest cable network operator. Via its origins - individual regional cable network operators that were merged into Tele Columbus - the company dates back to 1972. Today, about 3.6 million connected households in Germany are served by Tele Columbus, primacom, pepcom, Deutsche Telekabel, Martens und KMS with TV signals and, increasingly, digital broadcast packages, Internet and voice connections provided via high-performance broadband cable. As a national provider with a regional focus and a partner of the housing industry, the Group is present throughout its core markets Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia as well as in numerous key regions in western Germany. In tune with current demand trends, the company is upgrading its networks in a hybrid fibre-optic infrastructure for superfast Internet connections of up to several hundred megabits per second with the state-of-the-art Internet transmission standard DOCSIS 3.0. The broadband cable caters to the entire range of innovative media applications from analogous, digital and highdefinition TV to high-speed Internet and voice connections to telemetry services, tenant portals and interactive services. Beyond merely transmitting signals, Tele Columbus uses its own product platform in order to actively increase the programme offering and to develop additional services. Via its company HL komm, Tele Columbus also delivers powerful connections and network services to business customers.

Berlin, 14 November 2016. Tele Columbus AG (“Tele Columbus”, “Company” or “the Group”), the third largest German cable operator, published its financials for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2016. The Group continued on its successful growth trajectory in the third quarter recording a strong 59.9% increase and a pro forma increase of 3.1% in revenues to EUR 118.2 million (Q3 FY2015: EUR 73.9 million). In the nine months, revenues grew pro forma 4.1% year on year. The company also increased the Normalised total operating performance which includes own work capitalized amongst others by 56.2% to EUR 127.9 million (Q3 FY2015: EUR 81.9 million). Normalised EBITDA for the quarter strongly grew to EUR 63.7 million, resulting in an increase of more than 72% and a pro forma increase of 6.5% year on year (Q3 FY2015: EUR 36.9 million) and on a nine month basis 5.9% year on year. This led to a Normalised EBITDA margin of 53.9%, up 4.0ppt from the third quarter of FY2015. The increase reflects Tele Columbus’ successful operating performance as well as the positive effects arising from the integration of primacom and pepcom. In the reported period, Tele Columbus Group spent EUR 31.1 million on capital expenditures and – together with the EUR 47.8 million in the first half year – a total of 78.9 million in the first nine months (22.3% of revenues).
In the third quarter, the company showed a positive development of all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): As of 30 September 2016, Tele Columbus Group holds a stable basis of 3.6 million homes connected, approximately 5k up from June 2016, and is serving 2.42 million customers. With 1.58 RGUs (Revenue Generating Units) per subscriber (Q2 FY2016: 1.57x) the total number of RGUs increased by 19k to 3,823k (Q2 FY2016: 3,804k) which translates into 2.44 million Cable TV RGUs, 422k Premium TV RGUs and 463k Telephony RGUs.
Internet RGUs rose substantially to more than 500k which is an increase of 15k net additions quarter over quarter including the backlog of 3k from the second quarter. Meanwhile, close to 35% of Internet gross adds take 120 Mbit/s download speeds or more which is slightly up from the around 1/3rd reported with Q2 results. The total blended average revenues per user (ARPU) rose to EUR 16.3 per month in the third quarter 2016 (Q3 FY2015: EUR 14.9).
The Management Board of Tele Columbus reiterates its guidance for fiscal year 2016 expecting

stable homes connected of approximately 3.6m, a
mid-single digit percentage revenue growth versus pro forma revenues of FY2015, a
high single digit percentage Normalised EBITDA growth year on year versus pro forma FY2015

and specifies its guidance for

Capex to the lower end of the originally communicated 35% to 38% of revenues range.

„Even though we are heavily working on the integration of primacom and pepcom, we are well on track growing our business nicely by following our four key strategic initiatives”, says Ronny Verhelst, CEO of Tele Columbus Group. “We will continue on that path consequently in order to take full advantage of the market chances arising.” As key drivers for its mid-term development the company is pursuing the targets to generate organic growth, to make use of the smaller M&A opportunities in the German cable market, to exploit the synergies from the integration of the acquired companies and to expand the business customer activities. „This strategy is beginning to pay off – and given the strengths and opportunities of the company we are very much looking forward to further develop Tele Columbus on the basis of our prolonged management contracts” explains Frank Posnanski, the company’s CFO.
On 14 July 2016, the Tele Columbus AG was honoured with the Corporate Finance Award by the Boersen-Zeitung, one of the most renowned national business media for capital markets in Germany. The prize was awarded in 5 categories for the strategically and financially most outstanding transactions in 2015. Tele Columbus was elected in the category small/mid caps due to its consequent and successful acquisition strategy and the professional financing of the transactions.
On 1 August 2016, Tele Columbus has achieved another important milestone in the integration of its acquired companies and launched a new Internet & Telephony product portfolio for pepcom Group. The new Internet & Telephony products, marketed under the brandname cablesurf, offer speeds between 20 Mbit/s and 400 Mbit/s and give access to Tele Columbus’ free Community Wifi service. Together with the new Internet & Telephony product portfolio, Tele Columbus introduced attractive Triple Play-packages which include the necessary hardware.
On 19 August 2016, Tele Columbus launched its Community Wifi service in the Berlin Mercedes-Benz Arena offering its customers complimentary access to the Internet.
On 1 September 2016, Tele Columbus launched a new product portfolio for business customers offering Tele Columbus, primacom and pepcom customers harmonised commercial rates with bandwidths of 120, 200 and – depending on regional availability – 400 Mbit/s download speeds.
In September 2016, the group launched a new housing industry brand under the brand name “Tele Columbus Gruppe” serving as a strong umbrella for all housing industry activities in the transition phase until the introduction of a new company brand expected in 2017.
Recent developments
In October 2016, the group further intensified its close relations to the housing industry by reactivating its housing industry board in a new composition. The board is now chaired by Lutz Freitag, former president of the biggest German housing industry roof association GdW, and comprises 6 further renowned housing industry representatives.
Effective 1 October 2016, Roland Schleicher, formerly McKinsey Associate Partner and head of the McKinsey integration support team in 2015, joined as Chief Business Transformation Officer (CBTO).
On 11 October 2016, the Group announced that the contracts of CEO Ronny Verhelst and CFO Frank Posnanski were extended by three years to September 2019 and four years to September 2020 respectively.
On 13 October 2016, HL komm was re-certified for KV-Savenet 3.2 which allows the exchange of data via VPN between medical institutions.
On 14 October 2016, Tele Columbus AG has successfully concluded the repricing, consolidation and tenor extension of its €1.255 billion term loan facilities and amended certain other provisions in its €1.38 billion Facilities Agreement. The transaction became  effective
31 October and results in interest cost savings of €6.3 million p.a. from November 2016.
On 28 October 2016, Tele Columbus Group announced that the Group has reached long-term agreements continuing the existing partnerships with some of the biggest German housing associations. Based on the new contracts signed in September 2016, Tele Columbus Group will provide services to 170,000 existing and new homes connected.
On 28 October 2016, HL komm in cooperation with City of Leipzig successfully launched a City-Wifi consisting of 47 access points.
On 8 November 2016, the management signed a balance of interest and social plan with the Group’s workers’ council and the different workers’ councils of pepcom Group companies preparing the ground for full organizational integration of the pepcom group in 2017 and leading to significant expected personnel cost synergies from Q2 FY2017 onwards.
In the recent weeks, Tele Columbus Group successfully increased the number of connected homes ready for 400 Mbit/s to 880k and the number of Internet access points for the Community Wifi offering in the own networks from 50k to approximately 100k.

PRESS RELEASEChange in Management Board of Tele Columbus AGTimm Degenhardt to succeed Ronny Verhelst as CEO
 
Berlin, 24 July 2017. Tele Columbus AG (ISIN: DE000TCAG172, WKN: TCAG17), the third largest German cable network operator, announces a change in its management board: Ronny Verhelst (54) who led the company as CEO for nearly seven years since 2011 will leave for personal reasons as of 1 February 2018. He will be succeeded as CEO as of the same date by Timm Degenhardt (48), who is joining from the Swiss telecommunications provider Sunrise Communications AG. Timm Degenhardt will already start at Tele Columbus as of 14 August 2017 and will become member of the Group's management board as from 1 September 2017 for an initial term of three years until 31 August 2020. The five months transition period will ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities as well as a continuation in the management of the company. Frank Posnanski (50) will continue in his role as CFO and member of the management board.
Under the leadership of Ronny Verhelst the Tele Columbus Group evolved from a regional infrastructure company into a digital multimedia provider and a strong number three in the German cable market over the last couple of years: The financial restructuring of Tele Columbus and the successful IPO were followed by the integration of the cable companies number four and five in the German market and hence the consolidation of all medium-sized cable players in Germany. "With the upcoming introduction of a new and consolidated brand in autumn 2017, I will have accomplished my mission at Tele Columbus to make the company fit for the future", states the native Belgian Ronny Verhelst. "I would like to thank all my colleagues at Tele Columbus for their fantastic commitment as well as all our partners for the excellent cooperation over the past seven years. At the same time, I would like to ask for their understanding regarding my decision to relocate my focal point of life to my home in Belgium."
"It is almost impossible to adequately value Ronny's achievements. With his vast experience, his strategic skillset, his strong execution capability and his drive, he successfully managed to turn the company around", comments Frank Donck, chairman of the supervisory board of Tele Columbus AG. "In the name of the entire supervisory board I would like to thank Ronny for his achievements and we wish him all the best for his professional and private future. At the same time, we are very happy to have won with Timm Degenhardt a high-qualified and experienced successor. With a strong commercial background and customer focus, Timm is also truly familiar with the telecommunications and infrastructure market and, over the past couple of years, actively shaped the digitalisation of the media industry in several key positions. Together with him, we would like to continue the growth path for Tele Columbus."
German Timm Degenhardt is joining from the Swiss telecommunications provider Sunrise, most recently as Chief Consumer Officer and member of the management board with responsibility for the entire consumer business. Prior to this, he was Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Commercial Officer at Sunrise since 2013 and with his drive for both customer orientation and digitalisation laid foundations for the successful Sunrise IPO. Previously, Timm Degenhardt was CEO at aizo Group, a smart home applications company, since 2010 and Senior Vice President Marketing & Sales at E.ON AG since 2007. This was preceded by several senior leadership positions at American Express and at the telecommunications provider Orange, where he was a member of the management board and Vice President for Marketing and Product Development since 2004. Timm Degenhardt holds a Master of Science in Marketing Management from Nottingham Business School and a degree level diploma in Marketing from the Chartered Institute of Marketing in London.
"I am very excited to commence my new role, because I am truly convinced that the new digital applications, the growing demand for media content and the increasing mobile usage will offer great opportunities for a high performance broadband internet and entertainment provider such as Tele Columbus", states Timm Degenhardt, who will join the company's management effectively 14 August 2017. "The German market has to catch up a lot in international comparisons when it comes to innovation and adaption of new tech and media trends. In my opinion, a nation-wide yet also locally-footed provider like Tele Columbus offers excellent opportunities to tap that potential."
________________About Tele Columbus
The SDAX listed Tele Columbus Group is one of Germany's largest cable network operators. Via its origins - individual regional cable network operators that were merged into Tele Columbus - the company dates back to 1972. Today, about 3.6 million connected households in Germany are served by Tele Columbus, primacom, pepcom, Deutsche Telekabel, Martens und KMS with TV signals and, increasingly, digital broadcast packages, Internet and voice connections provided via high-performance broadband cable. As a national provider with a regional focus and a partner of the housing industry, the Group is present throughout its core markets Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia as well as in numerous key regions in western Germany. In tune with current demand trends, the company is upgrading its networks in a hybrid fibre-optic infrastructure for superfast Internet connections of up to several hundred megabits per second with the state-of-the-art Internet transmission standard DOCSIS 3.0. The broadband cable caters to the entire range of innovative media applications from analogous, digital and high-definition TV to high-speed Internet and voice connections to telemetry services, tenant portals and interactive services. Beyond merely transmitting signals, Tele Columbus uses its own product platform in order to actively increase the programme offering and to develop additional services. Via its company HL komm, Tele Columbus also delivers powerful connections and network services to business customers.
