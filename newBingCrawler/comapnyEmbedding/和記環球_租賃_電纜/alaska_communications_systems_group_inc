Alaska Communications (formerly Alaska Communications Systems or ACS) is a telecommunications corporation headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska. It was the first telecommunications provider in the state of Alaska to maintain a third-generation wireless network and the only provider in Alaska that owned fully incorporated infrastructure for the major telecommunications platforms; wireless communications, Internet networking, and local and long distance phone service. Alaska Communications wireline operations include advanced data networks and a diverse undersea fiber optic system connecting Alaska to the contiguous United States. The Alaska Communications wireless operations included a statewide 3G CDMA network, and coverage extended from the North Slope to Southeast Alaska.
History[edit]
The company was formed in 1998, when CenturyTel announced the sale of its Alaska operations (newly acquired from PacifiCorp) to local management and Fox Paine & Company.[2] In 1999, Alaska Communications acquired Anchorage Telephone Utility from the Municipality of Anchorage.[3]
On December 4, 2014, GCI Wireless agreed to purchase the wireless assets of Alaska Communications for $300 million. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015.[4]
