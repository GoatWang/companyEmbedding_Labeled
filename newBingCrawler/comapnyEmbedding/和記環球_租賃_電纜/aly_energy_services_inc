(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  As used in the subsequent discussion, "we", "our", and "us" refers to Aly Operating prior to the Merger transaction on May 14, 2013 and to Aly Energy thereafter. For the purposes of discussing and reporting financial information, we do not distinguish between Aly Energy and Aly Operating because the impact of the inclusion of Aly Energy, a "shell company" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under Exchange Act) prior to the Share Exchange (described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K), on the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.  21  Beginning on April 16, 2014, our financial results include the financial results of the business acquired in the United Acquisition. Beginning on July 1, 2014, our financial results include the financial results of Evolution.  This section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement because of various factors, including, without limitation, those described in the sections titled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.  History and General Description of Our Business  Inception of Aly Operating  On July 17, 2012, Munawar "Micki" Hidayatallah founded and incorporated Aly Operating Inc. ("Aly Operating"), formerly Aly Energy Services Inc., in Delaware with the strategic objective of creating an oilfield manufacturing, distribution and services company that serves exploration and production companies from well planning to plug and abandonment. We intend to grow our business both through organic growth resulting from investment in existing operations and through the acquisition of existing businesses operating in our industry.  Acquisition of Austin Chalk  On October 26, 2012, Aly Operating acquired all of the stock of Austin Chalk Petroleum Services Corp. ("Austin Chalk") for a total purchase price of $22.5 million. Total consideration included $17.9 million cash (net of cash acquired of approximately $58,000), a payable of $0.8 million and the issuance of 4.0 million shares of Aly Operating Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value, at fair value of $3.8 million.  Austin Chalk was founded in 2001 as a provider of high performance, explosion-resistant rental equipment and quality assurance services for land-based horizontal drilling. Austin Chalk currently offers a robust inventory of surface rental equipment as well as roustabout services which include the rig-up and rig-down of equipment and the hauling of equipment to and from the customer's location.  Share Exchange  On May 14, 2013, Aly Operating and Preferred Voice, Inc. ("Preferred Voice") entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement"), pursuant to which the holders of common stock of Aly Operating surrendered all of their shares in exchange for approximately 68 million newly issued shares of common stock of Preferred Voice (the "Share Exchange"), representing approximately 92% of the outstanding common stock of Preferred Voice after giving effect to the Share Exchange. Shares were exchanged at the ratio of 19.91 shares of Preferred Voice common stock for each one share of Aly Operating common stock.  Immediately after the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement, Preferred Voice amended its certificate of incorporation to change the name of Preferred Voice to Aly Energy Services, Inc. ("Aly Energy" or the "Company") and Aly Operating amended its certificate of incorporation to change the name of Aly Energy Services Inc. to Aly Operating, Inc.  For financial accounting purposes, this acquisition (referred to as the "Merger") was a reverse acquisition of Preferred Voice by Aly Operating under the acquisition method of accounting and was treated as a recapitalization with Aly Operating as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared to give retroactive effect of the Merger completed on May 14, 2013 and represent the operations of Aly Operating.  22  Acquisition of United Centrifuge  On April 15, 2014, Aly Energy acquired the equity interests of United Centrifuge, LLC ("United") as well as certain assets used in United's business that were owned by related parties of United (collectively the "United Acquisition"). In connection with the United Acquisition, United merged with and into Aly Centrifuge Inc. ("Aly Centrifuge"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aly Energy. United operates within the solids control and fluids management sectors of the oilfield services and rental equipment industry, offering its customers the option of renting centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment without personnel or the option of paying for a full-service solids control package which includes operators on-site 24 hours a day. United owns centrifuges which are differentiated from the competition due to the ability to remove the rotating assembly from a centrifuge within 45 minutes while on the rig site minimizing customer down time.  Total consideration for the United Acquisition of $24.5 million included $15.1 million cash, net of cash acquired of approximately $0.6 million, the issuance of 5,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock at Aly Centrifuge ("Aly Centrifuge Redeemable Preferred Stock"), $0.01 par value, at a fair value of $5.1 million, contingent consideration of up to $5.0 million in aggregate over 3 years at a fair value of $3.5 million, and a payable of $0.8 million. The contingent consideration consists of up to three future cash payments to the sellers in an amount equal to 5% of the gross revenues of the business acquired for each of the 12 month periods ending on March 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  Acquisition of Evolution  On July 1, 2014, Aly Energy acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Evolution, which specializes in providing MWD services, for total consideration of approximately $2.0 million consisting of the issuance of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an estimated fair value of $1.7 million and a payable of $0.3 million. Subsequent to the acquisition, Aly Energy expanded the Evolution service offering by adding full package directional drilling services. In addition, Aly Energy has invested in the in-house fabrication of MWD kits which we believe provide a technological advantage over other MWD kits on the market.  Overview of Our Business  We are a provider of surface rental equipment, solids control systems, and directional drilling services, including MWD services. Our equipment and services are primarily designed for and used in land-based horizontal drilling. Our equipment includes mud circulating tanks (400 and 500 barrel capacity), mud pumps (diesel and electric), live oil skimming systems with mud gas separators, flare lines with flare stacks, containment systems with stairs, portable mud mixing plants, centrifuges, shakers/vertical dryers, and MWD kits. We also provide personnel at the customer's well site to operate our equipment in certain product lines, such as skimming systems, centrifuges, downhole drilling motors and MWD kits, and we provide personnel to rig- up/rig-down and haul our equipment to and from the customer's location. We service the Permian Basin (in Texas and New Mexico), Eagle Ford Shale, Utica Shale, Marcellus Shale, Woodford Shale, Granite Wash, Mississippian Lime, and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale. Our primary operating yards, shop and repair facilities, and division management are located in Giddings, Texas, San Angelo, Texas, Prosper, Texas, and Houston, Texas.  We derive the majority of our operating revenues from day rates or hourly rates charged for the rental of our equipment and for the services provided by our personnel. The price we charge for our services depends on both the level of activity within the geographic area in which we operate and also the competitive environment.  Our operating costs do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues. Our operating expenses consist of both fixed and variable costs. Although most variable costs are highly correlated with revenues and activity, certain variable costs, such as sub- rental equipment expenses and third party trucking expenses, can be reduced as a percentage of revenues by our investment in new rental and transportation equipment.  23  Industry Trends and Outlook  Current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related level of drilling activity and general production spending in the areas in which we have operations primarily influence the demand for our services. The level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity in the United States is volatile and may vary based on oil prices, governmental regulation, governmental limitations on exploration and drilling activity, and other factors.  We operate in the commodity-driven, cyclical oil and gas industry. Since the beginning of 2011 and through mid-2014, the industry operated in an environment where crude oil prices largely avoided this cycle. During the fourth quarter of 2014, crude oil prices significantly declined due to continued growth in U.S. oil production, weakened outlooks for the global economy and continued strong international crude oil supply, especially from OPEC's unexpected decision to maintain oil production levels. As a result of the weaker crude oil price environment, many crude oil development prospects are or are becoming less economical for many operators, leading to an expected downturn in demand for our products and services and an overall weaker demand for oilfield services.  We experienced reductions in both the pricing and the utilization of our equipment in the fourth quarter of 2014 and we continue to experience such reductions in 2015. Although we have implemented significant cost control efforts in 2015, including headcount reductions and field wage reductions, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact of the current market conditions on our operations.  We believe we will face significant challenges in 2015, primarily due to anticipated continued volatility in oil and gas prices, and these challenges may have a significant negative impact on our operations, financial results and ability to access capital in 2015 and beyond.  Results of Operations  Our results of operations depend on the demand for our services and our ability to provide high quality equipment and service to satisfy that demand while maintaining an efficient cost structure.  Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 were significantly impacted by the inclusion of the results of United Centrifuge and Evolution, which were acquired on April 16, 2014 and July 1, 2014, respectively. In addition, steady demand for our services in our existing markets and strong demand for our services in our new geographic markets had a positive impact on the results of our legacy business.  Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013  The following table summarizes the change in the results of operations of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The year ended December 31, 2014 includes the financial results of both United and Evolution (the "Acquisitions") beginning on April 16, 2014 and July 1, 2014, respectively (in thousands):  24 -- For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Revenues $ 42,504 $ 18,418 Expenses: Operating Expenses 23,351 9,875 Depreciation and Amortization 4,959 2,389 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 5,752 2,399 Corporate Expenses 2,506 1,826 Total Expenses 36,568 16,489 Operating Income 5,936 1,929 Other Expense Interest Expense 1,033 460 Amortization of Deferred Loan Costs 284 169 Total Other Expense 1,317 629 Income Before Income Taxes 4,619 1,300 Income Tax Expense 2,006 640 Net Income 2,613 660 Preferred Stock Dividends 467 209 Accretion of Preferred Stock, Net (57 ) 37 Net Income Available to Common Shareholders $ 2,203 $ 414  Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $42.5 million, an increase of 130.8%, compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Acquisitions contributed $18.2 million in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining increase in revenues was due to strong demand for our mud circulating tanks and diesel mud pumps, particularly in the Permian Basin where we began operating in the third quarter of 2013, partially offset by a decline in pricing and demand for our live oil skimming systems. Our revenues generated from the hauling, rig-up/rig-down, and cleaning of our equipment increased to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 while remaining consistent as a percentage of total revenue due to the strong correlation of the revenue generated by these services to our rental revenues and overall level of activity.  Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $23.4 million, or 54.9% of revenues, compared to $9.9 million, or 53.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of $10.7 million of direct costs from the Acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining increase is primarily due to increased third-party expenses incurred, typically to sub-rent equipment, haul equipment, and clean equipment, in order to meet the increase in customer demand.  25  Depreciation and amortization expense increased 107.6% to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of depreciation expense and amortization expense associated with the Acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, depreciation expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to a larger fixed asset base throughout 2014, partially offset by a change in the estimated useful lives of certain types of equipment which became effective on July 1, 2014. Additional detail on the change in accounting estimate is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.  Selling, general and administrative expense increased 139.8% to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The $3.4 million increase is primarily due to the inclusion of $2.3 million of selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the Acquisitions. The remaining increase is due to increased payroll expense and related burden resulting from the expanding scope of operations and the strengthening of infrastructure to enable efficient growth partially offset by a non-cash adjustment to the fair value of a contingent payment liability.  Corporate expense increased to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the addition of personnel to support the increased size of the organization resulting from the Acquisitions. Corporate expense consisted primarily of payroll for corporate employees (including approximately $0 and $76,000 of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) and legal and professional fees, including audit and accounting fees. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, legal and professional fees included fees which were non- recurring in nature, primarily related to the Acquisitions and the Share Exchange, of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.  Interest expense and amortization of deferred loan costs was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in interest expense and amortization of loan costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to the expansion of our credit facility to $35.0 million in April 2014 from $18.5 million and the additional borrowing incurred in connection with capital investments during the year ended December 31, 2014 to expand our operations. We also incurred additional interest expense related to various capital leases and equipment loans entered into during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $2.0 million, or 43.4% of our income before income taxes, compared to income tax expense of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or 49.2% of our income before income taxes. Income tax expense includes state income tax which is primarily revenue-based and disproportionately increases income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  We disclose and discuss EBITDA as non-GAAP financial measure in our public releases, including quarterly earnings releases, investor conference calls and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We define EBITDA as earnings (net income) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our measure of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.  We also make certain adjustments to EBITDA for (i) non- recurring expenses, primarily professional fees related to acquisitions, and (ii) non-cash charges, such as bad debt expense, share-based compensation expense, and the changes in fair value of our liability for contingent payments, to derive a normalized EBITDA run-rate excluding additional non- recurring costs and non-cash expenses ("Adjusted EBITDA"), which we believe is a useful measure of operating results and the underlying cash generating capability of our business.  Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, these metrics should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.  26  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used by investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental financial measures that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt, pay deferred taxes and fund growth and maintenance capital expenditures. We also believe the disclosure of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our cash flow generating capacity from quarter to quarter and year to year.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also financial metrics used by management (i) as supplemental internal measures for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; (ii) as a significant criteria for annual incentive cash compensation paid to our executive officers and management; (iii) as a reference point to compare to the EBITDA of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions; and (iv) as an assessment of our ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness.  The following table provides the detailed components of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as we define that term for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively (in thousands):   For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Components of EBITDA: Net Income $ 2,613 $ 660 Non-GAAP Adjustments: Depreciation and Amortization 4,959 2,389 Interest Expense, Net 1,317 629 Income Tax Expense 2,006 640 EBITDA $ 10,895 $ 4,318 Adjustments to EBITDA: Stock-Based Compensation Expense - 76 Bad Debt Expense 122 113 Fair Value Adjustments to Contingent Payment Liability (408 ) - Non-Recurring Expenses 311 295 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,920 $ 4,802  Set forth below are the material limitations associated with using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP financial measures compared to cash flows provided by operating activities.   EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the future growth and maintenance capital expenditures,   EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest, future principal payments and other financing-related charges necessary to service the debt that we have incurred to finance acquisitions and invest in our fixed asset base,   EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the deferred income taxes that we will eventually have to pay, and   EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in our net working capital position.  27  Management compensates for the above-described limitations in using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP financial measures by only using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to supplement our GAAP results.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our on-going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to acquire equipment in order to increase our existing rental fleet and to expand product and service offerings, to service our debt, and to fund our working capital requirements. Our sources of liquidity have been internal cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, equipment financings, and proceeds from the sale of equity.  We believe that we will have the ability to provide for our operational needs, our planned capital expenditures, estimated contingencies and possible investments in 2015 through projected operating cash flow and our credit facilities. However, we anticipate that continued volatility in oil and gas prices during 2015 will affect our operations, financial results, and ability to access sources of capital. Should our projected cash flow and credit facilities not be sufficient, we may reduce capital expenditures and future investments and/or consider the issuance of debt and/or equity securities.  The net cash provided by or used in our operating, investing, and financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is summarized below (in thousands).   For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Cash Provided By/(Used In): Operating Activities $ 4,131 $ 3,988 Investing Activities (27,805 ) (8,658 ) Financing Activities 24,284 4,450 Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 610 $ (220 )  Operating Activities  For the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated $4.1 million of cash from operating activities. Our net income for the period was $2.6 million. Non-cash additions to net income totaled $6.8 million consisting of an aggregate of $5.2 million in depreciation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of deferred loan costs, $1.8 million in deferred taxes, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense, partially offset by a $0.4 million fair value adjustment to a contingent payment liability.  During the year ended December 31, 2014, changes in working capital used $5.2 million in cash. Cash was provided by a net increase in payables and accrued expenses of $1.3 million offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of approximately $5.7 million, due primarily to an increase in revenues in connection with both our legacy business and the Acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, an increase in length of time between the issuance of invoices and collecting payment. Changes in other current assets resulted in an additional use of cash of $0.8 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated $4.0 million of cash from operating activities. Our net income for this period was $0.7 million. Non-cash additions to net income totaled $3.5 million consisting primarily of $2.6 million of depreciation, amortization of intangibles and amortization of deferred loan costs.  During the year ended December 31, 2013, changes in working capital used $0.2 million in cash. Cash was primarily provided by a decrease in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.5 million in accounts payable offset by a decrease in accounts payable - affiliate of $0.8 million.  28  Investing Activities  During the year ended December 31, 2014, we used $27.8 million in investing activities of which $15.1 million was the cash purchase price, net of cash acquired, associated with the United Acquisition. We used $12.9 million of cash to invest in machinery and equipment during the period, including $4.0 million for the cash portion of consideration for the Saskatchewan Equipment Purchase, approximately $1.8 million for the fabrication of 5 new MWD kits, approximately $0.7 million in vertical dryers which was a new rental offering in 2014, and $0.6 million in the fabrication of our unique 400 bbl mud mixing plants.  During the year ended December 31, 2013, we used $8.7 million in investing activities, all consisting of the purchase or fabrication of capital assets, partially offset by $0.3 million of cash acquired from the reverse merger with Preferred Voice.  Financing Activities  During the year ended December 31, 2014, financing activities generated $24.3 million of cash. Net borrowings of $15.4 million during the period resulted from the expansion of our credit facility to finance the United Acquisition. We also issued common equity during the period raising $9.4 million in net proceeds through private placements of our Common Stock. Payment of deferred financing . . .
