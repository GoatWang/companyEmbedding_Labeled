Rostelecom stock lost 6.79 %, and the last close price as of 02 Aug, 2017 is 7.08 for ROSYY stock.  Looking at Rostelecom market capitalization, which currently stands at 2.85B, we can say that ROSYY stock is a Mid cap stock.  Rostelecom valuation can be different from its intrinsic stock price when viewed from a value investors perspective.  The stock price movement of a company indicates what investors are willing to pay.  For Ex: if investors feel that Rostelecom is worth a lot, it will most likely be reflected in an inflated Rostelecom stock quote, and vice versa.  However, it must be noted that a company's value must not be equated to its share price.  The volume of shares traded stood at 3038 on the last trading day, as is evident from Rostelecom stock chart, and ROSYY stock quote data.  A dividend is a cash payment from a company's earnings and is distributed among shareholders.  Rostelecom does pay dividends.  One can observe stock price trends and check for volatility by checking Rostelecom stock price history.

March 13, Moscow - Rostelecom has signed a contract with Zenith football club to deliver integration services as part of its project to implement an SAP solution to create a new supporter relationship management platform. The 3 year contract amounts to RUB 44.5 mln.
      

        Rostelecom will provide cloud services coupled with a software and hardware solution for SAP implementation to be installed in the company's data centre. The company is now buying equipment required for its implementation and is shaping the IT infrastructure of in line with SAP technical requirements.
      

        Once the project is complete, Rostelecom will be further delivering technical support services to the established IT infrastructure, namely a complex 24/7 monitoring and administration of entire infrastructure, a whole cycle of maintenance of operational system, a technical support of equipment and systems software as well as an online support.
      

        Dmitry Mankind, Commercial Director of Zenith FC, commented: 'We started our cooperation with Rostelecom in 2015 and they have really enhanced the development of Zenith FC. Zenith is always committed to addressing the challenges behind the logistics and organization linked with the sport industry and the growing standards for arranging home matches, processing of databases, ensuring smooth internal communication, information security and many others. Our partner Rostelecom offers solutions which can ensure a sustainable and efficient development of our brand'.
      

        Valery Ermakov, VP for b2b/b2g products, also commented:' We have significantly enhanced our product portfolio for b2b/b2g clients. Now, not only can we deliver traditional services, such as the leasing of channels, but also a range of up-to-date cloud solutions. These cloud services are in high demand among our clients today. We are happy to see Zenith become our so called 'cloud' client.
      

        We have been implementing this project in the partnership with SAP which is set to introduce an effective system for fans relationship management for Zenith FC. This system will enable us to monitor a history of relations with all target audiences of the club. Also it can provide fans with tailored offerings, ticket discounts etc. This is a unique IT project for Russia's entire sport industry'.
      

        Ilya Yuriev, Deputy Director General of the SAP CIS, commented: 'The SAP technologies not only allow sport clubs to efficiently manage relationships with their supporters, but also forecast ticket sales, schedule individual trainings, efficiently develop tactics, etc. For instance, the German national team managed to reduce the the average time each player kept the ball from 3.4 seconds to 1.1 seconds at the World Championship in Brazil thanks to a SAP solution'

For your information, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Ekaterina Ustinova, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Rostelecom's third quarter 2016 operational and financial results. Present on the call today, with me, are Sergey Kalugin, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company; Vladimir Kirienko, Senior Vice President for Business Development and Operations; Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Maria Florentieva, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Media. So the order of today's conference call will be the same as usual. So, we'll have a short presentation from our speakers and then followed by Q&A.Before we begin, let me remind you of our disclaimer statements. Any information provided during this call may contain projections and other forward-looking statements. While we believe that these projections are reasonable and are based on our current trends, market and industry trends, we wish to caution you that actual results can differ materially from these projections. We have no intention to update these projections or reflect the occurrence of unexpected events. So, now, we are ready to begin and Sergey, please go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) Good evening, dear colleagues. (spoken in foreign language) As you will appreciate, we want to update our results for the third quarter 2016. (spoken in foreign language) And the information we're about to share, well, at least, we feel sort of -- moderately optimistic about it and hopefully, you will feel the same once we share the results with you. (spoken in foreign language) It's good to mention that as usual we continued to increase the number of users of our Pay TV, our broadband Internet and also we're finishing building the optic fiber network in the areas where we didn't have it yet. (spoken in foreign language) And this good growth of new products and services brought about some very good financial results.(spoken in foreign language) Our revenues grew by 0.4%. (spoken in foreign language) We have great EBITDA and EBITDA margin similar to what we had a year ago. (spoken in foreign language) We (inaudible) that we were able to almost double our net profit year-on-year, which is good news. (spoken in foreign language) But importantly, the numbers that I've just shared demonstrate that the digital transformation that we have started a while ago is now bringing results that we like. (spoken in foreign language) For example, in cloud services and product, we grew by more than 40%. (spoken in foreign language) That's what helped us compensate the lost revenue that we didn't receive because of the budget cuts that resulted in lower payments under the BDD project. (spoken in foreign language) I'm also pleased to say that the projects that have been started just recently, for example, the Rostelecom's production system are also using some very good results already. (spoken in foreign language) For example in Novosibirsk, obvious, where we piloted it, productivity grew by 20% and profitability grew by 10%. (spoken in foreign language) We also see the positive performance of NPS or Net Promoter Score, we also see the reduction in the financial markets. We can see that the reduction is by several clients. (spoken in foreign language) I would also like to mention that the Company has adopted an new long-term incentive program that will be in operation in 2017, 2018 and 2019. (spoken in foreign language) It is very much different from the previous program.Read More(spoken in foreign language) We believe that the new program is similar to what IT companies or Engineering Technology companies would have. (spoken in foreign language) Importantly, almost any employee can become part of the program. (spoken in foreign language) And an important principle is that employees will totally invest together with the Company. (spoken in foreign language) So that, we have that share matching plan, which is part of the program and importantly, the people such as programmers, system architects and engineers will be getting more share from the Company as a result of their co-investing efforts than others. So in that way, we will stimulate the most productive, the most technologically intensive and the most creative people and professions. (spoken in foreign language) I also like to mention that as part of this program, people who are responsible for developing the production system, as well as cutting cost, are also entitled for having opportunities to get more shares from the Company than perhaps some other people. (spoken in foreign language) I would also like to mention that we have launched a full-fledged MVNO almost across the whole of Russia. (spoken in foreign language) And currently, we see that our initial ambition to have 15% of penetration into our client base through basically mobile coverage, seems to be quite reasonable. (spoken in foreign language) And it is perhaps a bit early to talk about that, but just on the preliminary data, we see that this sort of cozy and full play offering indeed helps reduce customer churn, (spoken in foreign language) including in fixed telephony and that's basically all I wanted to say.And with that, I am happy to turn it over to Vladimir.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vladimir Kirienko, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP for Business Development and Operations [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much Sergey. Hello to everyone who is on the line today, I am delighted to have joined by an experienced and professional management team. We have a bright future ahead of us and I am looking forward to contribute to it. As you know, I am a recent joiner and I have full intent to draw on my background in banking and (inaudible) industries to make this role a success. I'm responsible for the management of two key business area; commercial activity, as well as system stability for the regional branches, and the direction of the Company's new business development. I have not been here long, but I can already tell you that the management has made a significant progress in management of the Company's strategy; defending its traditional voice business and branching out into the new market with high growth potential, however, it has still a lot to do.First and foremost, we need to improve our new product development procedures. You can see from our results that for the last two quarters where value-added services and clouds has been the largest contributor to the topline growth. This can be further accelerated by intensifying product development, and ensuring products are marketed effectively so we got the most out of the unit growth scenario, such as data centers, cloud computers, big data, industrial Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, GEODATA and others.Secondly, our blended ARPU can be increased by setting our customer base to digital and content service. We need to promote the core service of Pay TV and broadband, more aggressively by intensive customer care and coming up with more tailored packages, for customers to increase value for money and custom satisfaction. These are key goals for the coming year and my main area of systems stability. Let's come back to the results. If you look on to the operational results, we demonstrated the third quarter of 2016, was a successful both in terms of penetration of our digital business and in terms of operational highlights. The most prominent event of the third quarter was the commercial launch of MVNO with Tele2.Now we can deliver quadruple-play solution across the country, which is truly promising and unmatched service given our national wide scale of our operations. As of today, MVNO has been launched in 16 out of 65 regions and more importantly for us, we finally got a presence in Moscow market. And I think it's really a great win for us. This is a key driver that can help us grow our topline, especially in B2B and B2G segments. Another fuel of our success in the third quarter was video surveillance for the parliamentary elections held in September. This vast project was successfully executed under the regional contract of RUB500 million.Rostelecom once again proved its worth as a reliable and safe partner in realizing ambition, complex and large-scale projects. We hope this will go a long way to strengthen our status to the partner for the government. We had a number of other important government contracts, in B2B and B2G space that supported our revenue, including contracts with Justice Department, Smart City projects and others. On the B2C side, we can keep promoting attractive proposition to our plans to stimulate consumption in video-on-demand and other high growth services, which resulted in higher subscriber base and increased revenue. All this translated into a growth across all of our key operation indicators. Growth in number of broadband customers reached 7% or 12.2 million (inaudible), while the IPTV space grew by 28% to 4 million customers. Most importantly for us in terms of revenue, content and digital service grew at a pace of 12%.Cloud and value-added services posted a substantial growth of 44%. As a result, the share of digital and content services increased to 44% as well in the third quarter of 2016 from 40% in the same period last year. This is in line with our strategic goal of becoming a digital service provider by delivering an increasing portion of services such as Pay TV, broadband, cloud, industrial Internet of Things and others and we are happy that we are on track to reach this target.This is all from my side. I would like to hand over to our CFO, Kai-Uwe.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP, CFO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much Vladimir. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. On my side, first of all, presenting today, financial and operational results. I would like to confirm that we are happy, content with the growth of the results, that is very important. We see that the initiatives taken by the management in face of revenue is growing year-on-year, despite the fact that normal spending, the decrease in fixed line revenue which is not an issue which is not easy to compensate. Nevertheless, we have been able to do that and the result has showed that in our financial position.OIBDA margin and OIBDA in absolute terms is stable and resilient, despite tough competition and also inflation in Russia. There are however, reasons for being conservative, due to the difficult macroeconomic environment and there is a significant risk that the state reimbursement for the BDD project, Bridging the Digital Divide will be reduced in 2016. Based on this, we will slightly review our guidance and I will come back to this later on during my presentations. Let's take a more detailed look into the financial results starting with revenue.As already said, revenue is up year-on-year by 0.4% and we reached RUB72.8 billion in quarter three and also revenue is up compared to last quarter by RUB1 billion. We also believe that we will traditionally show strong revenue quarter four and we are heavily working on that in spite of our homerun initiative for the Company. As already stated, we reached RUB25 billion in OIBDA, which is equal to 34.4% in margin, which is solid, resilient based on results take into consideration the environment. This is slightly above our expectation we had coming from last quarter. In terms of CapEx, investment holdings, we are continuing to fulfill important projects. CapEx cash is coming back to normal. So we had discussion up to half year results and I explained that we will have seasonal effect during the year and effectively this is happening. So CapEx implied for the Q was lower than the previous quarter. So we invested RUB13 billion including BDD project. And if you take this together, up to nine months, we have a ratio of 19.7% excluding BDD. I will come back to it later on when we talk about profit for the total year.I would also like to mention that we have had a very strong quarter in terms of net income. Net income, we reached RUB4.1 billion and I think it's important to say that, that was the strongest quarter since five to six quarters in a row, which we are also confident that we can show good results in terms of net income, no matter the external environment. I think it's also worth to say that this result could be even better. However, so far, we have negative influence on our equity consolidations with Tele2. If you look on the nine months results, net income reached RUB8.7 billion and we are also confident that we will add another [one quarter] in quarter four.Let's look on the next slide, in order to achieve this, we have no other way than controlling our costs. Because, first of all, we have to compensate declining revenue from fixed, which is traditionally good margin business and we entered into new products where the life cycle is just starting. We believe that we do that, so we can see this on this page, I will not comment on each and every single item. However, I would like to state that, payroll in quarter three was affected by further headcount optimization and also one-off payment. So we continue to close productivity and based on this we also optimize our headcount. At the same time, utility cost increased, mainly due to higher electricity tariffs and also we have had effects from increase in other operational income mainly related to BDD project which we try to offset by decrease in other operating expenses as much as we could.Next slide. Free cash flow during quarter three was very strong, RUB5.9 million, we could manage. We also believe that quarter four, will be traditionally a very strong quarter, in terms of cash flow. This has to do also with improvement in cash collection, this has to do with additional strong payments from B2B. So we are confident that we will also have a strong quarter four in terms of cash flow like we had with last year and the year before. The total debt and the net debt during quarter three, likely being influenced came from dividend payment, which we did during July and August. And the combination of very positive free cash flow and the dividend payment influenced slightly increasing debt. However, the debt ratio remained on 1.9, so we are quite confident that this is in good hands.Also, we are confident with regard to our total debt structure, which you can see on the slide. Important to say that during quarter three, we did successfully bond placement. So we utilized RUB15 billion bond at 9.2% which is for the time being an Russia benchmark. Also note the improving macro-economic environment, Fitch and S&P upgraded the Company's outlook to stable which we are also happy to announce. Next slide. Based on this coming back to the outlook, we said that we would like to slightly revise our outlook based on the macroeconomic environment and also due to the fact that we expect slightly lower reimbursement from the BDD project. So before we stated on a revenue that we believe that we would be, revenue growth to be 1% and 2%, now we slightly believe it will be up to 1%. This is with regard to revenue, but we are confident that revenue will grow year-on-year and I think that is, in any case good result taking into the environment and also fixed line growth. On OIBDA, we forecast mid-single-digit decline against [2016]. However we also believe that quarter four will be strong in terms of profitability same as quarter three. And last but not least, regarding CapEx, we raised the rate of our CapEx projection, we will be on the level of 19%, CapEx sales ratio of slightly below and this is excluding BDD project as we stated before. You might ask about how much will BDD in CapEx around the total year. So we believe that it will be around RUB5 billion, that includes our insurance projection.Thank you very much from my side.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much for Kai-Uwe. Thank you very much for the presentation. So now we are ready to start our Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) So George can we have the first question?================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Roman Arbuzov, UBS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Roman Arbuzov, UBS - Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have two questions please. One is on BDD and another one is on Tele2. So on BDD, it obviously remains a key issue for the Company. Could you please share your expectations of BDD revenues for this year and perhaps also next year that will be very useful? And then could you also perhaps give us some color in terms of how quickly do you think you can adapt to the new revenue environment when it comes to BDD? And do you think you can adapt immediately, for example, would you think there is a significant time lag between the new, sort of spending environment and the cost side and the investment side of the equation? That's the first question. And then one more in Tele2 please. So last quarter, you mentioned that you were very happy with the relationship you have with Tele2, you're happy with the project you're executing together and the synergies you're getting out of it. So I was just wondering if your thinking has changed at all over the last three months? And could you perhaps tell us under what circumstances would you potentially consider taking control of 32?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) Regarding the BDD project, we have, so to say our own attitude to that project, which is undergoing a change. (spoken in foreign language) We rely on other sources of revenue and you may have seen from our presentation that revenues or proceeds from that project have decreased substantially. However, they didn't have [incremental sort of say] on our financial results because we were able to compensate the loss of profit and revenue from that project through other sources.(spoken in foreign language) We are very happy that our focus on new product and services in particularly cloud where our growth has improved the business, really brings good results. Obviously, we are not Amazon, but we are moving in that direction. (spoken in foreign language) And if we speak about the budget and that's the area where we have three-year budgets in this country and this is the length, this is the period of the budget which is currently under review in the Russian State Duma or Parliament. (spoken in foreign language) So the numbers are solid, in 2017, our proceeds are expected to be RUB12 billion. (spoken in foreign language) RUB12.5 billion in 2018 (spoken in foreign language) and RUB13.5 billion in 2019. (spoken in foreign language) We currently have a much tighter cost control in that project and we almost do not fast track any construction under this. (spoken in foreign language) So we have much stricter control of what we receive and how we spend it under the project. (spoken in foreign language) Now in response to your second question.(spoken in foreign language) We have said many times that Tele2 is not an easy story so to say. (spoken in foreign language) And you're right, recently, we have been trying to look for more synergy between ourselves and Tele2. (spoken in foreign language) For example, we have told you today that we have practically completed the launch of full MVNO. (spoken in foreign language) And just a couple of words here about how we look at this project, how we see it. (spoken in foreign language) We are not just looking to through it increase the loyalty of our subscribers and reduce churn. (spoken in foreign language) We also understand that MVNO for us is a vehicle of entry into new markets in which we seek to increase our footprint, (spoken in foreign language) such as for example, the M2M and IoT, the Internet of Things market. (spoken in foreign language) And you are aware that we invest a lot in data centers and new platforms that Vladimir has mentioned such as for example, GEODATA and others. (spoken in foreign language) And I hope a day will come, if not very soon, but quite soon when I will be able to tell you about new products and services that we have building on Tele2. (spoken in foreign language) That is on one hand. (spoken in foreign language) On the other hand Tele2 is undergoing transformation and they have to become a full-fledged broadband provider. (spoken in foreign language) And we make everything possible so that the activities that we have at Rostelecom was available and was used by Tele2. (spoken in foreign language) And I hope that Larisa Tkachuk will contribute to that. She will be more and more involved with Tele2 going forward. (spoken in foreign language) I apologize if that was too long an answer, but I wanted to explain all those to you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can we have the next question please?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Semenov, Deutsche Bank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Semenov, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have a question on the dividends. So I mean so far, your free cash flow is negative, quite far behind the level of free cash flow generation you had this time last year. So, I just wanted to double check whether you are committing to an increase in dividend per share for this year and the three-year target of RUB45 billion?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) From the numbers that I see (spoken in foreign language) we see that our cash flow is actually positive and it will continue to grow. We expect to see growth in the fourth quarter. (spoken in foreign language) And as a management, we'll do our utmost to implement the dividend policy approved by our Board of Directors. (spoken in foreign language) And as management we'll do our utmost to implement the dividend policy after (inaudible). (spoken in foreign language) And myself personally, I don't see any substantial challenges to that so far.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Semenov, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can I also follow-up on the guidance and sort of 2017 EBITDA target. So this year, I suppose it's a bit of a first majority that you're losing or not getting rather RUB46 billion of revenues for the BDD project. But for next year, would you say that EBITDA should be more or less in line with the 2015 level in aggregate, so around RUB100 billion. Is that the right way to do it? I mean you would scale down the operating expenses or how should I think about this?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) We believe that it will be premature to be talking about 2017. (spoken in foreign language) One thing I want to say is that, currently, we are much more conservative about potential revenues under the BDD project. (spoken in foreign language) And we pay much more attention to some other projects, which on the one hand can bring about increase in revenue and net profit, and on the other hand reduce costs. (spoken in foreign language) So if nothing certainly happens in Russian economy then our results for the next year should be at least as good as for this year. But of course, it's again, a bit premature to be talking about that, because the budgeting process is still underway.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator, can we have the next question please?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, OTKRITIE Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital - Analyst [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A follow-up question on your free cash flow and the dividends. So just hypothetically, if I look at that, in Q3, your free cash flow this year is below the amount of dividend payment, which you made this year. Should we expect any contraction of the dividend in 2017 or in other words, could you pay more than your -- more than 100% of your annual free cash flow as dividend for the year? And what is the minimum you're going to pay by all means as dividend next year?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) I would like to rephrase and say once again that in our plans we abide by the dividend policy approved by the Board of Directors and will make our utmost to implement it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital - Analyst [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just want to clarify that you are fine with paying more than 100% of your cash flow as dividend, so that really -- because your dividend policy implies you need to pay more than 75% of the free cash flow. I mean paying more than 100% isn't fine for you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) It's possible, but looking at the results of the third quarter and from what we see so far in the fourth quarter, it seems to me that we should have enough to stay within the boundaries of the dividend policy as far as the free cash flow is concerned. That means that we will have enough free cash flow to pay the dividend that we have to under our dividend policy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital - Analyst [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In connection with your answer, looking at the free cash flow in the fourth quarter 2016, probable question to Kai-Uwe, how should we look at your working capital in the fourth quarter? So seasonally usually you have some release of the working capital due to the reduction of the trade receivables. So do you see that all the trends stay pretty much the same as they have in last year?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP, CFO [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Because if we look to last year and to the year before, our working capital balance has been always improving in quarter four. First of all, we especially, at the end of the year due to certain asset management cleaning, more than -- during the year, this is one aspect. Second, maybe more important is that we typically get reimbursement and get payment from B2B structures partially as well as the B2B sector. So working capital is hugely, very nor has a positive balance in quarter four, this is one point. Second point is also from CapEx perspective, typically, we closed quite a number of projects. In quarter four, however, given on the terms of payment, payment for those projects is moving into quarter one because a lot of projects are finally closed in November/December. Based on this, if you think in terms of CapEx cash, quarter four is relatively light quarter compared to other quarters. So these are the main reasons. In terms of seasonality, we have seen over the year-end we believe more or less similar things will happen this year. We obviously cannot forecast cash flow 100% because it has to do with cash collection and it does not depend 100% on us. But we will do utmost our best to achieve reasonable, similar results than in previous years.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, thank you. Operator, can we move to the next question, please?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Dilya Ibragimova, Citigroup.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dilya Ibragimova, Citigroup - Analyst [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I had a question please on or I have two questions actually. First is, maybe to Larisa if she is in this presentation, or maybe some more, if you could give us a bit more details on her new role. It seems like she has a lot of experience, relevant experience to be involved into the team. Could you perhaps give us a bit more of what the -- is she going to be responsible for the marketing or overall management or just a bit more on her new role? And second question is on your real estate program. There has been I think there definitely has been a sale of real estate so far this year, what are your expectation for the fourth quarter and whether there is any macro impact on the release of the real estate?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) We are setting formulas, Larisa is not with us here today. (spoken in foreign language) Just let me make it clear. Larisa is not going to work with those two. (spoken in foreign language) We as shareholders have many opportunities to participate in the management of the company through various vehicles, through committees and the Board of Directors. (spoken in foreign language) And also we can meet with the management (inaudible) as kind of a wish. (spoken in foreign language) So we'll mostly use these vehicles.(spoken in foreign language) As to in what specific capacity, Larisa could be helpful to our joint venture. I think you have mentioned just the right things that she could bring to the table. (spoken in foreign language) And I would like to make it clear that we do not want to sort of shadow or second guess the existing Tele2 management. (spoken in foreign language) And we know that there are a lot of respected and efficient people working for Tele2 and in fact, new people come on board for example, recently (inaudible) has joined the Company. He is quite well known in the industry. So we would reject ourselves to the instruments available to us as shareholders, we do not want to interfere with the Tele2 management.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP, CFO [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Regarding the second question, you put on the table in direction of the real estate. We believe that we will see especially also in quarter four, quite a strong activity from our side. In terms of the recent real estate, we have quite a lot in the pipeline and this is also why -- one reason as to why we are quite positive in terms of cash flow. I mean, this is one of the reasons we have talked before. We have been a little bit less active than previous year during the first half year and there is a good reason for that. The market was very volatile and also there was a drop in the pricing, so we thought that it will be better to stay less active and put it to later time. And I think that was a good decision because we see that slowly, slowly the market is kicking off, so we can realize let's say sale at advertising terms. So answering your question, we believe in quarter four, we will see stronger activity and stronger impact on our P&L respectively. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------George, can we have the next question please?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, OTKRITIE Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie Capital - Analyst [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A follow-up question, sure. So my question is on the regulation of interconnect. So should we expect any announcements on the changes in the regulation of the interconnect from fixed to mobile? And when do you expect them to come to force and what sort of an impact you think it will have on your financials?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sergey Kalugin, Rostelecom PJSC - President [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(spoken in foreign language) Thank you for your question. (spoken in foreign language) I think that you as well as us share the inequality that is part of that matter of that issue, (spoken in foreign language) or rather how (inaudible) it is. It's difficult for me to make any prediction or forecast about when exactly the regulation will change. (spoken in foreign language) But I have a feeling that most of the topics that are implied on the new legislation have already been agreed. (spoken in foreign language) It's difficult for us to speak for the regulator. We are trying to be reasonably optimistic about it, but it's difficult for us to comment about any timing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Operator, do we have any other questions?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Kazaryan, VTB Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Kazaryan, VTB capital - Analyst [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would like to ask quite short question about taxes. We see that there is improvement of tax refunds in the last quarter, but still it is smaller than we saw it in the nine months 2015. I would like to ask you, do you expect an improvement in the last quarter. You still paid more taxes than there were refunds. So, do you expect higher tax refunds in this year than you had than in the previous year and whether they exceed tax paid?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vladimir Kirienko, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP for Business Development and Operations [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for your question. And first of all, I would like to tell you that I have good news. Why good news because we did tax statement amendment and also the nearly 100% confirm what we asked to confirm. So we have confirmation of additional reimbursement of RUB1.9 billion to Rostelecom. Most likely, according to the schedule issued, that is in the next four to six weeks during this year, and this is also one of the reasons why we are (inaudible) confident that we will improve cash position. So, I just want to answer the question. So we will have a similar positive influence than we had last year. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Anna, do you have follow-up question. Okay, operator, can we have the next question then.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group - Analyst [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have a rather numerical question on the guidance. Basically, take into account that your EBITDA for the first nine months declined by 3.5%, you know that to arrive even to the higher end of your guidance, we need to -- if I understand we need to see decline in EBITDA in the last quarter by more than 5%, if my calculations are correct, of course. If so, what would be the reason for such significant decline in EBITDA? Is there any one-off items that you expect into your fourth quarter or either any one-off items in the period for comparison that may lead to a decline?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP, CFO [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------First of all, we will obviously try to do our best to give a better result. I mean there is no reason from our side that we should hide any margin next year and we will not do that. So that is statement number one. Statement number two, if you look to the seasonality, usually because of marketing activities and other reasons, quarter four in terms of OIBDA margin is, usually slightly lower than in other quarters. So taking this into account, our projection based on the nine months actual figures makes sense. However, as I said we will do our utmost best to do it as competitively we can.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group - Analyst [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On seasonality, I was talking about year-on-year comparison. So fourth quarter 2016 to the fourth quarter 2015. So seasonality, if I understand should not be a reason for the change however, am I wrong?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP, CFO [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We said before that we have information that the BDD contract (inaudible) other revenue than we had expected. And (inaudible) talked about this. This is one of the major reasons, why we are looking now more conservative.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group - Analyst [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In this quarter, when the EBITDA was down by just 1% versus last year, it didn't happen the underpayment on digital divide.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor, can you repeat the question, please?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group - Analyst [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, I'm looking -- I understand that this year is going to be weak largely because of the BDD underpayment. But the third quarter was relatively strong. So I'm just trying to understand what is different between third quarter and the fourth quarter. Why third quarter is looking good, why this fourth quarter is going to be looking much more than that. That's the sort of broad context of my question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP, CFO [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are several reasons. Reason number one, and if you look to the quarterly OIBDA margin performance in telecom companies, they're different quarter-by-quarter. So we do not have one line OIBDA margin and this the mainly reason for this, for instance also the B2B contract and B2G contract, they are closed and finished in different quarters. Giving one example we had, this quarter the contract in terms of revenue on the election which is one-time item and we did not have the same contract in quarter four, this is one example. Also we took measures on the BDD, let's say cost reduction and all those things are taken into consideration, but we believe on the one hand by this we take a conservative view. We will try to do an improvement as matter of fact, today this projection is stable today.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you Mr. Goncharov. As we have no further questions at this time, I will turn the call back over to Ms. Ustinova for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ekaterina Ustinova, Rostelecom PJSC - IR Director [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much for your questions. Thank you very much for your attention. So we are done for today. Have a good evening.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vladimir Kirienko, Rostelecom PJSC - SVP for Business Development and Operations [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bye, bye.

Mikhail Oseevsky, President of Rostelecom, commented:


"The Company's digital transformation continued to gain momentum, as evidenced by the digital segment's growing contribution to total revenue, which increased by 5 p.p. and reached 47% by the end of the first quarter. We are also increasing our competitive positions in the key pay-TV and broadband segments, thanks to higher levels of positive client experience and the best fibre optical infrastructure in the country. We are happy to have recorded the highest level of revenue growth in our broadband segment during the first quarter than at any other period over the past six quarters at 7%.


"A great deal of attention is also being placed on the expansion of our product line, in both the public and private sectors, by growing our new offering to include among other solutions cyber security services and the development of "cloud" solutions for businesses.


In May, the BoD proposed to its AGM the dividend payment for 2016. We believe that the dividend pay-out for 2016 reflects the company's actual performance in the reporting period. We intend to significantly increase the portion of free cash flow that is distributed to our shareholders. This reflects our commitment to the key principle of our policy which is to allocate more than three quarters of the free cash flow for dividends, and no less than RUB 45 billion within a period of three years, without increasing the Company's debt burden. The proposed level of RUB 5.39 per share enables us to maintain a high dividend yield, generally in-line with our current dividend policy.


Kai-Uwe Mehlhorn, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, added:


"The first quarter results reflect the mixed dynamics across our key segments. Our business is successfully transforming into a leading digital services provider, through units that are contributing significantly to our top-line. At the same time, we are experiencing a certain level of decline in our traditional business line. As a result, lower revenues from interconnect and traffic transit, mainly influenced by the strengthening of the rouble, prevented us from reporting revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017. Nevertheless, we have a positive outlook for the economy in 2017, particularly given the growing trend for digitalization across private and public sectors, which is opening up new growth prospects for our business. We therefore maintain our full year forecast of delivering revenue growth of approximately 1%, and an increase in OIBDA within 1%. We also expect a CAPEX to Revenue ratio of 18.5% excluding the implementation of the Bridging the Digital Divide project."
