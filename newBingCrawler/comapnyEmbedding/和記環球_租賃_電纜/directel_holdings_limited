	        Outbound tourism is becoming common in China, and China has become the biggest outbound tourism market in the world. In 2014, the number of Chinese outbound tourists had breakthrough 100 million. The surrounding countries are mainlanders’ primary traveling destinations. Outbound traveling market is surging, not only in China, but also around the world.







	        the number of Chinese outbound tourists: 10 thousand people

        [pic] an overview of Chinese inbound/outbound tourists numbers

        In 2013, the number of outbound tourists had reached 98.18 million people, an increase of 18% over the previous year. Asia accounts for 85% of the top 10 destinations, while Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan account for approximately 70% of it.

        In 2013, the number of inbound tourists had reached 129.07 million people, a decrease of 2.5% over the previous year. Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan account for 102.78 million people (~80%), while foreigners account for 26.29 million people (~20%).

        Facing this business opportunity, many device manufacturers have released their roaming service based on the terminal device, such as Google’s “Project Fi”, Huawei’s “Skytone”, Skyroam’s “Skyroam” and so on. TruPhone, a new global MVNO, also has provided a low price roaming service through traditional SIM card; and yet because of using traditional SIM card, it is greatly limited in terms of service experience, business comprehensiveness and extensibility.

        China-Hong Kong Telecom Ltd (China-HK Telecom), a member of the Group, is a MVNO in Hong Kong, providing one-card-multiple-numbers service in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan for over a decade and planning to merge with oversea MNOs through acquisition in order to qualify for global roaming.

Skytone Business Introduction:

        Skytone is a new type, creative integrated telecom roaming service, which is based on the Group’s years experience on one card multiple numbers service and combined with new era mobile internet technology. By working with the oversea operators, the group can provide a more convenient and cheaper roaming service with higher quality to the users.



	        



	        Taking the advantage of CA-SIM card’s one-card-multiple-numbers feature, the Skytone service provided by the Group could tackle two biggest issues of high roaming charges and difficult local SIM card purchase. With core technologies such as writing SIM card over the air by APP, CA authentication and encryption, and GOIP ,etc, the Group has created a new generation of roaming product.
 
        Meanwhile, Skytone is compatible with all kinds of network, meeting the strong needs of CDMA users who want to travel aboard.

Business Patterns:

        Other than China-HK Telecom’s 45411 IMSI, the Group works with other MNO and MVNO mainly by manufacturing normal SIM card and acquiring output file data from the card manufacturer, and then writing it into CA-SIM card by Skytone APP.

        Oversea CA-SIM users roaming in Hong Kong/Mainland China: Writing China-HK Telecom’s 45411 IMSI or other IMSI from our cooperated China operators into CA-SIM card to add Hong Kong/Mainland China phone numbers.

        Hong Kong/Mainland China users roaming aboard: writing output file data from the local MNO/MVNO by Skytone APP to add local phone numbers.

SKYTONE service APPs:

        The core APP of the Skytone system is

DIRECT-TX APP

        



	        The Directel exclusive technology can register SIM card into the network remotely through CA-SIM and GOIP device, which does not need to alter operator’s network. When one of the user’s numbers was called (including voice and SMS), Follow Me will forward it to the user’s phone in the roaming location (via Directel APP or general GSM module), the user would not need to pay for the call forward or IDD fees. With value-added service APPs featuring traveling and so on, users can purchase more non-telecom products.

        With value-added service APPs featuring traveling and so on, users can purchase more non-telecom products.
 
        Skytone

        



        With Skytone APP, Skytone product combines with CA-SIM; CA-SIM users gathered by all channels could write numbers into their CA-SIM card over the air by themselves.
 
        Skytone APP can encrypt or decrypt card data such as IMSI and Ki, and then write them safely into the CA-SIM card. With the SKYTONE system, single number users (such as Mainland China users) could upgrade to multiple numbers users.

Document Summary: Mobile Payments in China


                China is the world’s largest single mobile market. Indeed, China’s mobile payments industry is a burgeoning market. It is attracting a number of participants in an attempt to assume first mover advantage. While the market potential is very real, there is uncertainty over which proximity payment technology will ultimately secure dominance  - RF SIM on the 2.4 GHz band versus NFC on the 13.56 MHz band. 

This survey attempts to provide an overview of the contactless mobile payments ecosystem in China. It also explores the near-term regulatory directives and the payment technology competition amongst the key players and points out the likely winners. The race to lead in China primarily exists among the MNOs, banking institutions and the third party mobile payment service providers. Each has its own competitive advantage and offering to consumers.

              ENVIRONMENT‌‌
            



              ENVIRONMENT RELATED POLICIES
            

              The Group is a mobile virtual network operator. The Board of Directors also acknowledges well the importance of performing as a responsible corporate citizen. The Group has been implementing environmental protection and energy saving measures, where practicable to improve the efficiency of resources consumption. In establishing internal policies, the Group has strictly complied with the relevant laws and regulations on environmental protection implemented by the government. The Group will review the workflow process and the execution of relevant measures from time to time to ensure consistent implementation of the relevant policies.
            

              The working environment of the Group is an indoor office located in Hong Kong without any industrial plants. As such, the business of the Group does not generate any hazardous waste, air emission and waste water directly. The Group responds to the initiative of green office in its daily business operations by improving the efficiency of resources consumption, reducing waste generation through paper recycling, etc.
            



              USE OF RESOURCES
            



              The Group strives to use resources effectively and minimize the discharge of wastes. In the ordinary course of business, we have gradually implemented various energy saving and emission reduction measures. The relevant examples are as follows:
            

              Energy saving
            


                  Keep indoor air-conditioning temperature at 25˚C;
                



                  Encourage staff to shut down computers after work and switch off the lights if the employees are expected to be away from the room for more than one hour;
                



                  Encourage staff to switch office equipment, such as printers and computers, to energy saving mode (the equipment will enter the sleep mode under the standby condition); and
                



                  Replace the lighting system in the office by LED lights gradually.
                


              Reduce the use of resources
            


                  Encourage double-side printing and reuse of waste paper;
                



                  Purchase green and environmental printing paper; and
                



                  Encourage to use electronic channels for internal correspondence and communication as far as possible.
