Business Review 2012
performance and strengthened its position as the market leader in Sri Lanka. During the year, Dialog registered double digit revenue growth of 12% and increased its subscriber numbers by 13% to hit 8.7 million total base.
Data revenue mobile business grew by 59% YoY, whilst voice usage continued to increase, posting robust revenue growth of 8%. Continuous growth in Sri Lanka's high-speed mobile broadband sector saw Dialog chalk up 96% YoY growth to 900,000 subscribers at the end of 2013.
In 2013, Dialog sustained its lead in product innovation by introducing a host of firsts in market mobile products and services. In partnership with leading global payment providers, Dialog launched the first mobile point-of-sale (mPoS) solution on smartphones and tablets in Sri Lanka. Under its Near Field Communications (NFC) portfolio, the company introduced the country's first electronic travel card called 'Touch Travel Pass'.
Dialog secured a 10MHz tranche of mobile 4G LTE spectrum auctioned by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka in March 2013. Dialog was the first operator to launch mobile 4G LTE services in the region.
Further to this, the company upgraded its 3G network to HSPA+ and increased backhaul to cater to exponential growth in data usage. In addition, the company also expanded the number of 3G and Mobile 4G LTE base stations by 25% YoY.
Given its market leadership, Dialog also became the first and only authorised partner and service provider for Apple iPhones in Sri Lanka. At the same time, Dialog became the first operator to launch an operator branded smartphone in the country, making smartphones more affordable for every Sri Lankan.
As Dialog continues to expand and strengthen its mobile network across Sri Lanka, the company entered into an agreement with the Bay of Bengal Gateway Consortium to land a high capacity submarine cable in the south of Colombo. The investment brings the largest capacity of international bandwidth to Sri Lanka to date.
Dialog's international roaming services grew to reach 600 operators in 217 countries around the world. The company enabled its customers to have connectivity at all times, home and away, by expanding its 3G, GPRS and prepaid roaming destinations to 132, 176 and 124 countries and territories respectively.


In July 2013, Dialog was once again the first in South Asia to launch LTE roaming services with an Axiata affiliate company, M1 in Singapore. With this service, Dialog's roaming customers are able to enjoy continuous high-speed data services. This was followed by roaming services with operators within the Axiata footprint and also in Canada, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.
The company's infrastructure arm, Dialog Tele Infrastructure (DTI) continued to offer passive infrastructure as well as microwave and fibre optic transmission capacity to telecommunications operators and broadcasters. In view of providing high capacity and reliable backhaul transmission services, Dialog expanded its optical fibre network distance by 48%, connecting cities around the country.
By the of end 2013, DTI had 1,426 sharable tower sites with an external tenancy ratio of 1.12 times. DTI continues to be at the forefront of active and passive telecommunications infrastructure service providers in Sri Lanka, serving the Group's vision of augmenting core business revenue streams by alternative revenue streams.
In 2013 Dialog grew its digital services offering considerably. In D-commerce, the company introduced SMS payment vouchers allowing customers to make purchases through mobile phones at various merchants. Dialog consolidated its online properties, Anything.lk, ibuy.lk and tradenet.lk, into one portal called WoW.lk. The portal offers online shopping, daily deals, event tickets and classified advertisements.
Dialog's fixed telephony and broadband business, DBN, also saw robust growth during the year. It now serves a subscriber base of 477,000. Similarly, its pay-tv business saw a 25% YoY growth in total active subscriber base, reaching over 331,000 households in the country.

*  PAT normalised for translation forex loss SLR731 million in 2013 as well as translation forex loss of SLR2,176 million,deferred tax reversal of SLR2,277 million, and Suntel acquisition related cost of SLR343 million in 2012
Financial Performance
Dialog demonstrated strong revenue growth across all business segments to record consolidated revenue of SLR63.3 billion, a significant increase of 12% compared to 2012.
Underpinned by the positive revenue and continued operational improvements, the company posted 7% growth in EBITDA at SLR19.9 billion. EBITDA margin declined marginally by 1.5 percentage points to 31.5%. PAT declined by 14% due to revenue-based tax provision of SLR1.1 billion.
In light of Dialog's strong performance, the Board of Directors of Dialog announced a cash dividend of SLR0.29 per share to shareholders, 45% of consolidated income for 2013. The dividend is subject to Dialog shareholders' approval.
Outlook for 2014
Sri Lanka's telecommunication market will continue to be competitive in both voice and broadband services. The high-speed broadband service sector demonstrates substantial growth potential considering the relatively low penetration level in the country. Growth in traditional telecommunications services such as voice and SMS will be overshadowed by the exponential growth in data services. However, voice and SMS revenue would continue to be a significant contributor of the operators' revenue portfolios.
With its industry leading 3G and 4G networks in operation, Dialog is well positioned to seize the market opportunities in broadband and innovative products and services. 2014 will see Dialog fortifying its position as the leader in digital services in the country.
