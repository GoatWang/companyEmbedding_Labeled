Economic conditions remained difficult in many regions of the world, and were particularly dire in Southeast Europe, where OTE conducts all of its business. In our home market, Greece, which still accounts for the bulk of our revenues, the economy shrank by more than 6%, its fifth straight year of decline. The decline in consumer spending was even steeper, with unemployment rate currently reaching 27% of the population, and nearly 60% of all young people, while salary cuts and tax increases hit the disposable income of those who still had a job. In Romania, where we derive another significant portion of our sales, GDP and consumer spending failed to grow last year, and similar trends were observed in our other markets, Bulgaria and Albania. While telecommunications services have tended to be somewhat more resilient than overall consumption, the industry s revenues in our region suffered from a series of severe rate cuts mandated by the regulatory authorities in all the markets in which OTE units are active. In Greece, mobile termination rates were reduced by 74% over the course of the year, taking a significant toll on the industry s combined revenues and profits. Tariff reductions of comparable magnitudes impacted our international operations. Against this unfavorable economic and regulatory backdrop, OTE did a remarkable job on a number of fronts: we continued to provide our customers with solutions that are always innovative and reliable, and are also competitive in regulated fixed line- whenever we have control over their pricing; we intensified our cost-cutting efforts to mitigate the impact of severe revenue drops on our profitability; we considerably strengthened our finances; and we continued to invest wisely and selectively, ensuring that the countries in which we operate benefit from the technological infrastructure they require to rebound and return to growth. I would like to expand a little on our achievements in each of these areas. Building innovative solutions around our customers Our aim in the past few years has been to rebuild our customers experience of OTE products and services from the ground up, to put the customer at the center of all we offer. We achieved new major milestones in customer-centricity in A complete redesign of all our interactions with the public has been implemented in Greek fixed line, ranging from new retail shop formats to new statements that emphasize user-friendliness. The reorganization of our call centers, now accessible through a single number, has accelerated response time and fault repairs. At the same time, we have continued to make headway on the product front. In Romania as well as in Greece, richer content, notably in sports events, has resulted in robust growth in TV subscriber number, boosted by the launch of our successful Greek satellite TV offering. Authorized by the Greek regulator for the first time to narrow the pricing gap for doubleplay packages against our competition, we regained momentum in ADSL and were able once again to contribute to the overall growth of the Greek broadband market, a positive trend that we hope to continue fostering with the rollout of our high-speed VDSL offer, launched towards the end of the year. In mobile, our leadership in cellular data strengthens our market positions in all our countries, notably in the postpaid segments of the markets. We believe that our technological edge is and will remain instrumental in this highly competitive business. All in all, we are satisfied that our customers in all our markets appreciate the difference OTE makes to their lives, and that this advantage will increasingly fuel our resilience, and eventually our growth, in the coming years. Adapting our cost base Our customer-centric initiatives are key in mitigating the influence of economic and regulatory factors on our top line, but they cannot reverse the erosion of our revenues, and we need to work as intensively on the adaptation of our cost structure to this changing environment. Throughout the year, we pursued with determination the streamlining of our organization and the rationalization of our cost base. As I have noted in the past, the considerable efforts we are making to rein in operating expenses can only have a meaningful impact if we are able to reduce our largest source of costs, payroll and benefits. In 2012, in record time, we were able to launch and complete a major Voluntary Exit Scheme in the Greek fixed line. Initially intending to attract 1,200 employees, it was eventually adopted by more than 1,500 of our people, who left before the end of the year. This translates into a net saving of approximately 80mn on an annualized basis, and I want to emphasize that the cost of this programme was borne exclusively by OTE, with no participation from the Greek state and no demand on its pension funds. All told, we estimate that we have taken about 600mn of annual costs out of the Group over the past two years. We are proud of these achievements, which have enabled us to add a full percentage point to our EBITDA margin in the full year.23 23 Strengthening our financial structure Another key priority for the year was to get our financial structure in order and put ourselves in a position to meet our debt obligations of the coming year while continue to fund our investments for the future. During the year and in early 2013, we completed the sale of our stakes in Telecom Serbia and Hellas-Sat respectively, generating proceeds of over 600mn. In the second half of 2012, we have completely reshaped our debt profile through a series of loan extensions, borrowings at subsidiary level, bond repurchases and exchanges. This in-depth restructuring of our debt enabled us, in early February 2013, to raise a 700mn issue of fixed rate notes in the international markets. The issue was considerably oversubscribed, an important sign of investor confidence in the work we have done to consolidate OTE s finances in the difficult past years. Thanks to our continued strong cash generation, we ended the year with net debt of less than 2.9bn, a drop of nearly 1bn from the end of Our cash position at year end was close to 1.2bn, enabling us to face with confidence our investing and refinancing needs of the coming year. Investing for the future, ours and that of the nations we serve Throughout the year, we have pursued a selective but comprehensive programme of investments in updating our infrastructure and ensuring that the customers we serve have access to best-in-class technologies. Slightly more than one-tenth of our 2012 revenues were reinvested in capital expenditures, and this does not include the significant investments we had to make to renew and expand our mobile spectrum licenses in certain countries. In these tough markets, the continued implementation of this strategy and our management discipline enabled us to deliver a strong financial performance during the year. Total revenues dropped by slightly over 7% to 4.7bn, despite the severity of termination rate cuts and macroeconomics in the countries where we operate. Our stringent cost-reduction programmes resulted in a full one percent increase in our pro forma EBITDA margin to 35.4%. Our net income was quadrupled and we continued to generate considerable cash flow, roughly unchanged during the year at over 1.3bn despite lower sales. Special reference is due to the strong results of our international subsidiaries, which have delivered above expectations adding value to the Group, despite the highly volatile environment they face. In Romania, RomTelecom achieved consistent operating and financial performance, successfully implemented cost-reduction initiatives that resulted in an EBITDA increase, and significantly boosted the number of its broadband and TV customers. Cosmote Romania continued to enhance its operating efficiency, achieving a solid EBITDA margin, while increasing the number of business customers, capitalizing on targeted offers and synergies with RomTelecom in the B2B segment. In the extremely competitive and overcrowded Albanian market, AMC managed to increase its customer base and posted a 42% growth of mobile data revenues for the year. Last but not least, I have to point out Globul s solid performance under the tough Bulgarian market conditions, a performance which has attracted the attention of international investors. In April, 2013, the Group announced the signing of an agreement to sell Globul and Germanos Telecom Bulgaria A.D. to the Norwegian operator Telenor Mobile Communications AS, for an enterprise value of 717mn. In 2013, we do not expect to see material improvement in our operating conditions or the trends that have affected Greece for the past years. We estimate that the industry-specific obstacles and regulatory pressures will continue. Our revenues and profits will once again record the hits of mandatory tariff reductions implemented in the past year, as well as of potential new rounds. Intense competitive pressure is certain to eat into our revenue base in fixed and mobile. Facing these factors, we are confident that the continued implementation of our strategy, the operating momentum we have built and are continuing to foster, the dedication of all of our people, and our unflinching financial discipline will enable us once again to achieve a solid performance.

This database MAVISE is edited and published by the European Audiovisual Observatory.


The software of the database was developed in the framework of a contract with the DG Communication of the European Commission (2007-2011) and owned by the European Union (represented by  the European Commission).


Whilst the software of the database is property of the European Union, the European Audiovisual Observatory is the owner of its content, with the exception of elements provided by third parties, in particular Lyngemark Satellite providing information on the line-up of satellite channels and Bureau Van Dijk providing information on the addresses of companies.


The data collection process of information on the European television and on-demand audiovisual markets by the European Audiovisual Observatory is partly made possible in the context of a framework contract with the DG Communication of the European Commission (2012-2016) and specific contracts with this DG (for television) and DG for Communications Networks Content and Technology (for on-demand audiovisual services).


The data collection process has benefited from the help of the European Platform of Regulatory Authorities.


Neither the European Commission, nor the European Audiovisual Observatory nor any of the employees of the respective organisations, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights. Reference herein to any specific service (included linked websites) does not necessarily constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or promotion by the European Audiovisual Observatory, or the European Commission.


The views and opinions of authors expressed herein do not necessarily state or reflect those of the European Commission or the European Audiovisual Observatory or the Council of Europe. The fact that a television service or an on-demand audiovisual service is included in the database does not represent a position from the Observatory, from the European Commission or from any regulatory authority regarding its legal situation. In particular, the criteria used to include audiovisual services (television, on-demand audiovisual services) in the database are not completely similar to those defined by the European Directive on Audiovisual Services or by the transposition of this Directive in the national laws of Member States.


While every care has been taken to ensure accuracy, no guarantee is given that the material is free from error or omission. Our goal is to keep this information timely and accurate. In particular, an important number of on-demand audiovisual services accessible through distribution platforms do not provide clear identification of the company providing services. In a significant number of cases the identification of the company providing on-demand audiovisual services, and hence of the country of establishment of the services, is based on rational assumptions by the expert and analysts feeding the database.  If errors are brought to our attention, we will try to correct them. If you wish to propose changes concerning the presentation of your company in the database, please contact: mavise@coe.int

Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (Greek: Οργανισμός Τηλεπικοινωνιών Ελλάδος Α.Ε., Organismós Tilepikinonión Elládos AE), usually known by its Greek initials OTE, is the dominant telecommunications provider in Greece.[2] Along with its subsidiaries, is one of the largest telecom groups in South Eastern Europe. OTE Group offers broadband services, fixed and mobile telephony, high-speed data communications and leased lines services. In addition, the Group in Greece is involved in a range of activities, notably satellite communications, real-estate and professional training. At present, OTE companies employ about 30,000 people in 4 countries. Formerly a state-owned monopoly, OTE's privatization started in 1996 and is now listed on the Athens and London Stock Exchanges.[3]
Since July 2009 Deutsche Telekom is the largest shareholder of the company.
In September 2015, the company announced they are to discontinue the use of the OTE name and will instead adopt Cosmote as a uniform commercial brand. The company chose not to adopt the Deutsche Telekom brand under which name it operates in its Central and Eastern European operations.[4]

History[edit]
OTE was created in 1949 to bring several related public and private enterprises under one telecommunications umbrella. Prior to this, telephony, telegraphy, local and international connections were fragmented and ill-coordinated.
Up to 1998, the telecommunications market in Greece was a monopoly. The market was opened to competitors and OTE was gradually privatized. As a result, the Greek government currently holds 10% of the company's stock. Along with the rest of the telecoms market, OTE is regulated by the National Telecommunications and Post Commission (Εθνική Επιτροπή Τηλεπικοινωνιών και Ταχυδρομείων – EETT).
In 2007 Marfin Investment Group acquired 20% of the company, and in March 2008 sold it to Germany's Deutsche Telekom which later increased its stake to 25% plus one vote, matching that of the state.[6]

Criticism[edit]
Siemens[edit]
In the 2008 Siemens scandal, Siemens AG officials were accused of bribing local politicians and senior OTE officials to win a multimillion-dollar contract ahead of the Athens Olympic Games in 2004.
In July 2008, OTE filed a lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations, with respect to allegations of undue influence and/or acts of bribery in connection with contracts concluded between Siemens AG and OTE from 1992 to 2006. OTE was granted access to the prosecutor’s files and in July 2010, OTE expanded its claim and requested payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least €57.07 million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees.[20]
In 2010, the chairman of a special parliamentary committee examining allegations of bribery by Siemens AG was reported by local media to have sent a letter saying that OTE's management should face charges for dereliction of duty and for damaging the interests of the state. In June 2010, Greek prosecutors said that OTE's chief executive officer, Panagis Vourloumis, should face criminal prosecution, accused of corrupt practices in the maintenance of network contracts extended to telecom equipment makers Siemens AG, Anko and Greece's Intracom Holdings SA.[21][22] Panagiotis Vourloumis lodged an appeal to the Athens Court of Appeals which accepted his request to appear before the judges in person and to provide explanations for the case. In September 2011 the Court fully exonerated Vourloumis.[23]
Comverse Technology[edit]
In April 2011, Comverse Technology Inc. (CTI), headquartered in US, admitted to charges related to the payment of bribes to employees of OTE between 2003 and 2006 in order to obtain purchase orders. These bribes totalled $536,000.[24]
The management of OTE ordered an internal investigation to identify any possible involvement of executives and to protect the interests of the company.[25]
