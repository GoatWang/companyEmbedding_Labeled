Airtel provides GSM, 3G and 4G LTE mobile services, fixed line broadband and voice services depending upon the country of operation. Airtel is also testing VoLTE technology across five cities in India and should roll out the technology towards the end of 2017.[6] It is the largest mobile network operator in India and the third largest in the world with 400 million subscribers.[7][8] Airtel was named India's second most valuable brand in the first ever Brandz ranking by Millward Brown and WPP plc.[9]
Airtel is credited with pioneering the business strategy of outsourcing all of its business operations except marketing, sales and finance and building the 'minutes factory' model of low cost and high volumes. The strategy has since been adopted by several operators.[10] Airtel's equipment is provided and maintained by Ericsson ,Huawei,Nokia Solutions and Networks[11] whereas IT support is provided by IBM.[12] The transmission towers are maintained by subsidiaries and joint venture companies of Bharti including Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers in India.[13] Ericsson agreed for the first time to be paid by the minute for installation and maintenance of their equipment rather than being paid up front, which allowed Airtel to provide low call rates of ₹1 (1.6¢ US)/minute.[14]

History[edit]
In 1984 Sunil Mittal started assembling push-button phones in India,[15] which he earlier used to import from a Taiwan company, Kingtel, replacing the old fashioned, bulky rotary phones that were in use in the country then. Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) was incorporated and entered into a technical tie up with Siemens AG of Germany for manufacture of electronic push button phones. By the early 1990s, Bharti was making fax machines, cordless phones and other telecom gear.[16] He named his first push-button phones as 'Mitbrau'.
In 1992, he successfully bid for one of the four mobile phone network licences auctioned in India.[16] One of the conditions for the Delhi cellular license was that the bidder have some experience as a telecom operator. So, Mittal clinched a deal with the French telecom group Vivendi. He was one of the first Indian entrepreneurs to identify the mobile telecom business as a major growth area. His plans were finally approved by the Government in 1994[15] and he launched services in Delhi in 1995, when Bharti Cellular Limited (BCL) was formed to offer cellular services under the brand name AirTel. Within a few years Bharti became the first telecom company to cross the 2-million mobile subscriber mark. Bharti also brought down the STD/ISD cellular rates in India under brand name 'Indiaone'.[15]
In 1999, Bharti Enterprises acquired control of JT Holdings, and extended cellular operations to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. In 2000, Bharti acquired control of Skycell Communications, in Chennai. In 2001, the company acquired control of Spice Cell in Calcutta. Bharti Enterprises went public in 2002, and the company was listed on Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. In 2003, the cellular phone operations were re-branded under the single Airtel brand. In 2004, Bharti acquired control of Hexacom and entered Rajasthan. In 2005, Bharti extended its network to Andaman and Nicobar. This expansion allowed it to offer voice services all across India.
Airtel launched "Hello Tunes", a Caller ring back tone service (CRBT), in July 2004 becoming to the first operator in India to do so. The Airtel theme song, composed by A.R. Rahman, was the most popular tune on that year.[17]
In May 2008, it emerged that Airtel was exploring the possibility of buying the MTN Group, a South Africa-based telecommunications company with coverage in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East. The Financial Times reported that Bharti was considering offering US$45 billion for a 100% stake in MTN, which would be the largest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian firm. However, both sides emphasise the tentative nature of the talks, while The Economist magazine noted, "If anything, Bharti would be marrying up," as MTN has more subscribers, higher revenues and broader geographic coverage.[18] However, the talks fell apart as MTN Group tried to reverse the negotiations by making Bharti almost a subsidiary of the new company.[19] In May 2009, Bharti Airtel again confirmed that it was in talks with MTN and the companies agreed to discuss the potential transaction exclusively by 31 July 2009. Talks eventually ended without agreement, some sources stating that this was due to opposition from the South African government.[20]
In 2009, Bharti negotiated for its strategic partner Alcatel-Lucent to manage the network infrastructure for the fixed line business. Later, Bharti Airtel awarded the three-year contract to Alcatel-Lucent for setting up an Internet Protocol access network across the country. This would help consumers access internet at faster speed and high quality internet browsing on mobile handsets.[21]
In 2009, Airtel launched its first international mobile network in Sri Lanka.[22] In June 2010, Bhartil acquired the African business of Zain Telecom for $10.7 billion making it the largest ever acquisition by an Indian telecom firm.[23] In 2012, Bharti tied up with Wal-Mart, the US retail giant, to start a number of retail stores across India.[24] In 2014, Bharti planned to acquire Loop Mobile for ₹7 billion (US$110 million), but the deal was called off later.[25]
Bharti Airtel Limited ("Airtel"), the world's third largest mobile operator with operations in 20 countries across Asia and Africa, today said that its Treasury division has been adjudged as a highly commended winner of the Top Treasury Team (Asia) Awards at the Adam Smith Asia Awards 2015.[26]

On 9 May 2009 Airtel signed a major deal with Manchester United. As a result of the deal, Airtel gets the rights to broadcast the matches played by the team to its customers.
Bharti Airtel signed a five-year deal with ESPN Star Sports to become the title sponsor of the Champions League Twenty20 cricket tournament. But now the deal is terminated and Karbonn Mobiles is sponsoring Champions League Twenty20 cricket.[82]
Airtel, also signed a deal to be title sponsor the inaugural Formula One Indian Grand Prix during the 2011 season.[83]
Airtel, signed a deal to be title sponsor the I-League for 2013–14 I-League.[84]
Signature tune[edit]
The signature tune of Airtel is composed by Indian musician A. R. Rahman. The tune became hugely popular and is the world's most downloaded mobile music with over 150 million downloads. A. R. Rahman along with Anu Malik has re-used the same tune in Kannada movie titled Love.[85] A new version of the song was released on 18 November 2010, as part of the rebranding of the company.[85][86] This version too was composed by Rahman himself.[86]
Green initiative[edit]
GreenTowers P7 program[edit]
Bharti Infratel is the only telecom tower company, which has installed almost 3 MWT of solar capacity on their network, generating more than 5 million units of electricity every year. The Green Towers P7 program is scoped for 22,000 tower sites (primarily rural areas having low or no Grid Power availability) out of which 5,500 sites have already been implemented in the first year as a part of this 3-year program.[87][88][89] Once completed, the initiative will reduce diesel consumption by 66 million litres per year with a significant carbon dioxide reduction of around 150,000 MT per year. Bharti Infratel received the 2011 'Green Mobile Award ' at the GSMA Mobile World Congress at Barcelona and was also awarded the 2010 innovative infrastructure company of the year award at the CNBC Infrastructure Awards for this groundbreaking initiative. Bharti remains the first company in the world to introduce the practice of sharing of passive infrastructure by collaborating with their competition to share mobile towers and to reduce the collective carbon footprint of the industry.[citation needed] This has become a subject of case studies in institutions including the Harvard Business School.[citation needed]
Energy conservation[edit]
The company has installed solar hot water generator at its main campus in Gurgaon for fulfilling the hot water requirement in the cafeteria. Majority of its facilities across NCR region are now equipped with LES (lighting energy savers) which have reduced energy consumption in the lighting system to the tune of 10–25%. Variable frequency drives installed in the air handling unit at its campus have helped in enhancing the efficiency of cooling system by 10%. These measures have resulted in a total saving of 850,000 units of electricity per year.
Airtel has embarked upon technology related initiatives like virtualisation of servers that has helped it release over 500 CPUs. Also the drive of sending e-bills to the post-paid customers is helping save 12,840 trees annually. Within its campus the 'Secure Print Solution'—an automated queue management-based secured printing solution has led to an annualised saving of about 8 metric tonnes of paper.

Alternative energy sources such as solar energy used at 1050 sites saving 6.9 million litres of diesel and approximately ₹280 million (US$4.3 million).[88]
Energy efficiency measures such as Integrated Power Management Systems and variable speed DC generators have resulted in reduction in the rate of diesel consumption by 1.2 million liters, leading to savings of ₹47 million (US$730,000) across 900 sites.[88]
Demand side management like free cooling units instead of air conditioners has been implemented across 3400+ sites, saving consumption of 4.1 million liters of diesel.[88]

Controversies[edit]
Net neutrality debate[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Net neutrality in India.
In February 2014, Gopal Vittal, CEO of Airtel's India operations, said that companies offering free messaging apps like Skype, Line and Whatsapp should be regulated similar to telecom operators.[90] In August 2014, TRAI rejected a proposal from telecom companies to make messaging application firms share part of their revenue with the carriers or the government.[91] In November 2014, TRAI began investigating if Airtel was implementing preferential access by offering special Internet packs which allowed WhatsApp and Facebook data at rates which were lower than its standard data rates.[92] The statements of Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO of Singtel and also shareholder (32.15%) of Bharti Airtel share similar statements about the Anti-Net Neutrality position.
In December 2014, Airtel changed its service terms for 2G and 3G data packs so that VoIP data was excluded from the set amount of free data. A standard data charge of 4 paise (0.062¢ US) per 10 KB for 3G service and 10 paise (0.16¢ US) per 10 KB (more than ₹10,000 (US$160) for 1GB) for 2G service was levied on VoIP data.[93] A few days later Airtel announced a separated internet pack for VoIP apps, it offered 75 MB for ₹75 (US$1.20) with a validity of 28 days.[94] The TRAI chief Rahul Khullar said that Airtel cannot be held responsible for violating net neutrality because India has no regulation that demands net neutrality.[95] Airtel's move faced criticism on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.[96] Later on 29 December 2014, Airtel announced that it would not be implementing planned changes, pointing out that there were reports that TRAI would be soon releasing a consultation paper on the issue.[97]
In April 2015, Airtel announced the "Airtel Zero" scheme. Under the scheme, app firms will sign a contract and Airtel will provide the apps for free to its customers.[98] The reports of Flipkart, an e-commerce firm, joining the "Airtel Zero" scheme drew negative response. People began to give the one-star rating to its app on Google Play.[99][100] Following the protest Flipkart decided to pull out of Airtel Zero. The e-commerce giant confirmed the news in an official statement, saying, "We will be walking away from the ongoing discussions with Airtel for their platform Airtel Zero.[101]
In October 2016, India's telecom regulator TRAI recommended imposing a combined penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on three mobile network operators — Vodafone, Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular — for denying interconnection to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), the latest entrant into India’s telecom service.[102]
User privacy[edit]
In June 2015, a code used by the company was accused of compromising subscribers privacy.[103][104][105][106][107]
