      Commenting on the results, Osman Sultan, EITC's Chief Executive Officer, said:
    

      "EITC has made steady progress in the second quarter of 2017, with a 6.2% increase in Revenue and a slight improvement in Net Profit.
    

      "Driven by growth in handset sales, wholesale and fixed revenues, total Revenue reached AED
    

      3.26 billion in Q2 2017, representing a 6.2% increase over the same period last year. Revenue has also shown growth over the first six months of the year with a 4.3% increase to AED 6.42 billion.
    

      "Our mobile customer base increased 1.5% during Q2 2017 to 8.2 million customers, up from 8.1 million in Q2 2016. This was largely due to our strategy of focusing increasingly on attracting and retaining higher quality customers, with solid growth in postpaid customer additions.
    

      "Despite a steady performance during the quarter and the first half of the year, EITC continues to be impacted by challenging market conditions, with pressure on mobile rates and data monetization. Consequently, EBITDA and Net Profit stand at the same level as Q2 2016.
    

      "Looking towards a smart future, we have made further investments into Smart Dubai, the Virgin Mobile brand and adjacent markets. We will continue to invest in the future generation capacity of the business; EITC is a digital enabler and will be able to create new revenue opportunity as digital transformation for both consumers and enterprises opens up new markets.
    

      "A highlight for the second quarter of the year has been our progress with the introduction of the Virgin Mobile brand. During the period, we began a programme of pre-launch customer registration and conducted trial tests. We enrolled a few select number of UAE residents to test the product and its customer service, and are happy with the feedback received. We look forward to the full commercial launch of the Virgin Mobile brand in the UAE soon, and with it, bringing a fully digital and premium customer experience.
    

      "Our results are backed by our commitment to the future development of a digitally-enabled ecosystem. During the period, we achieved a milestone development in connectivity technology, with the successful testing of a 5G solution that will significantly upgrade connectivity speed for our users. With this initiative and more to come, we remain committed to a smart future, and the Government's vision for a smart nation."

Telecommunications & Wireless Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


The terminology wireless communication includes a wide range of products including handheld radios, PDAs, cell phones, and wireless networking. There are other examples of wireless technology that can be found in devices like Maritime VHF, garage door openers, computer mice, satellite television, GPS, keyboards, and cordless telephones.

Wireless communication has the ability to be limited to small distances, like it’s done with bluetooth communications, or also to thousand mile distances like with short wave radio communication. Very often wireless communication is applied where wires are not possible or costly.

Wireless communications can be found frequently within the telecommunication sector as a vehicle to transport data without the need to use wires. This transfer of data over large distances to communicate with complex, electrical products can be found in devices like telegraphs, teletypes, telephones, the use of microwave and radio waves, fiber optics and their corresponding electronics, in addition to its use in various orbiting satellites and the Internet.

While the focus of opportunity in the telecommunications industry continually changes from wired to wireless frameworks, the necessity to access a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum becomes increasingly valuable. There are many competing opinions of the best way to free up spectrum under the present power and control of the government bureaucracy’s around the world.
