KT Corporation Deploys Marvell's Game Changing G.now Technology for Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) Class Gigabit Broadband Services 
Marvell partners with Ubiquouss in providing unprecedented access over existing copper infrastructure for Korea's largest broadband internet service provider

Barcelona and Santa Clara, California

                  (February 25, 2014) –

          
	Marvell® (Nasdaq: MRVL), a worldwide leader in integrated silicon solutions, today announced that KT Corporation (KT), formerly known as Korea Telecom, the largest broadband internet service provider in Korea with 8 million broadband internet subscribers and 4 million IPTV subscribers, deploys the game changing Marvell G.now technology through its equipment manufacturer partner Ubiquoss. KT Corporation and Ubiquoss have selected G.now™ to enhance broadband access in multi-dwelling unit (MDU) buildings and enable FTTH class Gigabit broadband services for the Connected Home over KT’s existing copper infrastructure. KT and Ubiquoss are the newest to join a growing list of service providers, ODM and OEM partners implementing Marvell’s G.now transceiver in their latest digital home and access products, accelerating global adoption and enlarging the scope of ITU-T G.hn technology.

	“At Marvell we are very proud of our ingenuity and capability in delivering high performance and cost effective solutions to empower the global industry. This game-changing G.now technology is our latest contribution in enabling major service providers like KT Corporation to provide superior broadband service with existing infrastructure,” said Weili Dai, President and Co-Founder of Marvell. “I would like to thank the hard working teams of Marvell, Ubiquoss, and KT for their close collaboration in making the first G.now deployment possible. It is our passion and commitment to continue bringing great technologies to better the lives of global consumers.”

	“After successful field trials during the second half of 2013 with Ubiquoss equipment based on Marvell G.now technology, we have determined the technology has an impressive performance, is easier to deploy and provides substantial CAPEX savings when compared to traditional FTTH alternatives. We expect to extend the value-added service soon after the field’s evaluation to the major regions where demand is high for such advanced services,” said Dong Myeon Lee, CTO and Executive Vice President of Institute of Convergence Technology at KT Corporation.

	“Ubiquoss is dedicated to deliver state-of-the-art networking solutions for the broadband access market,” said Yong Ho Choi, EVP of Marketing at Ubiquoss. “By designing Marvell’s G.now silicon into our Gigabit Phoneline systems, we are giving a new life to the existing copper access infrastructure. G.now technology enables us to provision both symmetric and asymmetric access services as needed, solving one of the key problems faced by fixed-line service providers in the past. This technology is field tested and available today from Ubiquoss.”

	G.now enables fast and powerful connectivity, at data rates up to 1 Gbit/s over existing wiring, including electrical wires, coaxial cables, twisted pair and plastic optical fiber. G.now is G.hn technology applied for wireline broadband access networks, as an upgrade to VDSL2. Marvell G.now provides a much higher data rate (over 500Mbps over copper) than legacy VDSL systems (100 Mbps), TDD architecture with configurable uplink/downlink ratio, advanced FEC, automatic retransmission, NDIM technology for interference mitigation and automatic mitigation of Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT).

	Ubiquoss’s G.hn powered and industry’s first G.now products enable KT to deliver FTTH-class service to MDU apartments while avoiding the costs of replacing copper wires with optical fiber. These increased data rates ensure the access network is future-proof and ready to provide new services such as multi-stream 4K IPTV, cloud-based storage or 802.11ac wireless hotspots. With 18M national subscribers to wired broadband services (including xDSL, LAN and FFTH), KT has the world’s highest broadband penetration rate (97%) and is leading the broadband services revolution by continuously adopting next generation technologies for its population. Early 2013, the Korean government has announced its commitment to enable Gigabit broadband speeds in most parts of the country by 2017 in order to meet an explosive growth in data traffic. As the #1 wireline telco in Korea in market share, with 18M telephony subscribers (62%), 8M broadband subscribers (44%) and 4.7M IPTV subscribers (26%), KT has selected Marvell G.now to be the pioneer in enabling the world’s first Gigabit broadband services for its subscribers today.

	Ubiquoss is a leading provider of IP network equipment for broadband access over phone lines and UTP cables in MDU buildings, also #1 VDSL system provider in Korea. Its latest G.hn products include the 24-port G.hn Access Multiplexer (GAM) U4124B and G.hn Network Terminal (GNT) C301G, both using Marvell® HomeGrid Forum-certified 88LX3142 G.hn digital baseband processor and the 88LX2718 G.hn analog front end. In a fully loaded 24-port configuration, the U4124B can provide a total application-layer capacity of 9.6 Gbit/s.

KT&G (originally "Korea Tobacco & Ginseng" and later "Korea Tomorrow & Global Corporation", Korean : 한국담배인삼공사, Hanguk Dambae Insam Gongsa, ) is the leading tobacco company in South Korea with annual sales over $2 billion USD. KT&G was originally a government-owned monopoly but today is private-owned and must compete for market share with the world's largest tobacco firms such as Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco. KT&G’s sales volume share was 62% of the Korean market in 2009.[1]
KT&G produces popular Korean cigarette brands such as: The One, Indigo, Arirang, This, This Plus, Zest, Esse, Raison, and Lo Crux. It has been expanded outside Korea, especially through its superslims brand Esse in Russia and other eastern European markets.
KT&G also has significant affiliates such as a ginseng corporation, a pharmaceutical firm, and several bio ventures. Its headquarters are in Daejeon.
