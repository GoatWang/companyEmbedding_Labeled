Young Presidents' Organization

                    YPO (Young Presidents’ Organization) connects people with successful young chief executives in a global network unlike any other. Founded in 1950 in New York City by a young president named Ray Hickok, the organization unites approximately 20,000 business leaders in more than 120 countries around a shared mission: Better Leaders Through Education and Idea Exchange. A great deal has changed since YPO’s founding but certain things have remained the same: the value of a peer network and trusted mentors, the importance of ongoing education, and the need for a “safe haven” where issues can be aired in an environment of confidentiality. Over the past six decades, YPO has maintained its core commitment to these ideals while embracing change with each successive generation of young business leaders.

Calculation
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.



Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days Sales Outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
REDtone Asia Inc's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Jul. 2016 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Accounts Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0.634/0.791*91


=73.14



2. In Ben Graham's calculation of liquidation value, REDtone Asia Inc's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
REDtone Asia Inc's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Jul. 2016 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash And Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Accounts Receivable)+(0.5 * Total Inventories)


=1.022-3.051+0.75 * 0.634+0.5 * 0


=-1.55

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a company's sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

	Note About Forward-Looking Statements





	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are 

	"forward-looking statements"

	 within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words

	"believe", "project", "expect", "anticipate", "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "future," "opportunity," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result,"  "possible,"

	 and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section entitled 

	"Risk Factors"

	 (refer to Part I, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

	On April 30, 2007, the Company entered into loan agreements with Mao Junbao ("MJ") and MH for the establishment of Shanghai Huitong Telecommunications Co., Ltd ("Huitong"). On April 30, 2007, the Company entered into an equity pledge agreement, which provides that MJ and MH would pledge all their equities in Huitong to the Company and REDtone Shanghai.





	On July 16, 2014, Huitong, Mao Hong, a director and nominee shareholder of certain VIEs, and Wei Gang, an independent third party jointly incorporated Shanghai YuZhong Financial Information Service Co., Ltd  ("YuZhong") and the founders owned 49.8%, 25.1% and 25.1% of equity interests in YuZhong, respectively.





	On July 17, 2014, Huitong and YuZhong jointly incorporated Shanghai YuGuang Automobile Inspection Technology Co., Ltd ("YuGuang"). Huitong and YuZhong own 20% and 80% of equity interests in YuGuang, respectively.





	On September 11, 2014, YuGuang entered into an agreement with Zhou Jin Shan and Chen Xiu Lan to acquire 51% equity interest in Taizhou Haitai Motor Vehicle Inspection Co, Ltd. ("Haitai") from Zhou Jin Shan at a consideration of RMB652,800. Haitai is principally engaged in the provision of motor vehicle inspection service in the PRC. The acquisition was completed in January 2015.





	As of the date of acquisition, Haitai has 51% equity interest in Feng Cheng Motor Vehicle Inspection Co., Ltd.  ("FengCheng"). FengCheng is principally engaged in the provision of services for motor vehicle technical and emission inspection. Haitai and FengCheng was collectively known as "Haitai Group".





	Although the Company is not the shareholder of Huitong, Jiamao, Xin Chang, YuZhong, YuGuang, Haitai, and FengCheng, the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these seven (7) entities, as the Company has their respective voting powers and is entitled to receive all the benefits from the operations of these seven (7) entities. Hence, Huitong, Jiamao, Xin Chang, YuZhong, YuGuang, Haitai, and FengCheng, are identified as VIEs and are consolidated as subsidiaries of the Company.





	Mr Mao Hong, the appointed Chief Operating Officer, is also a shareholder of Huitong and YuZhong.

	The telecommunications industry in China is dominated by three state-run corporations: China Telecom Corporation Limited, China Mobile Communications Corporation and China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd, all of whom have 3G licenses and engaged fixed-line and mobile business in China. 






	We see competition from:






	(i) Direct Telecommunication Operators namely China Telecom Corporation Limited, China Mobile Communications Corporation and China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd. These companies may adopt a more aggressive pricing on their local and international calls and have direct impact on our discounted call services for corporate segment. Likewise, if these operators offer very competitive rates for domestic, long distance and international calls, it could pose a substitution threat to our EMS services.


	 




	3












	(ii) Other Discounted Service Providers




	The discounted service providers such as Super E-Secretary operate domestic calls and the tool to compete is to provide discount on long distance calls. This company, despite being a small player (less than 15% market share) in the Shanghai discounted consumer call market, may cause the price disruption when they compete on price aggressively.







	(iii) Other Mobile airtime reload service providers


	Other competitors like Smartpay, Defeng and YiQiao offers similar mobile airtime reload services in Shanghai. They entered into this reload services earlier than us but we command slightly better price advantage and better system support for paperless mobile reload in comparison with conventional paper-based reload model.  







	We believe our competitive advantage is derived from the following strengths:


	 






	(a)




	Competitive Pricing








	We, being one of the leading alternative voice service providers in Shanghai in terms of market share, could command the economies of scale to achieve lower minutes cost and lower operating cost per minute. Additional cost advantage is the low capital investment with self-developed technology.  By having advantage of longer market presence, credibility and dominant market share, we can afford to price its products and services competitively while maintaining healthy gross margins.


	 





	(b)




	Innovation









	Innovation embodied in all the products and services is the key to the competitive advantage of our operations. In addition, innovation also helps us to truly serve the needs of the customers and to provide value-added services and products to the customers.   





	Close communication with our front line resellers will enable us to gather market intelligence and assist us in strategy formulation that is relevant to market needs.









	(c)




	Value Added Services








	For the telecommunications services we provide, customers would also benefit from value added services in our convenient reload, customer care services and support, and e-billings.



	 





	Regulatory Matters







	REDtone China does not provide direct telecommunication services in PRC. REDtone China acts as a distributor for CTT. REDtone China has a business licence issued by PRC's State Administration for Industry and Commerce to carry out the distribution services.  REDtone China does not require a telecommunication licence to carry out its distribution activities.  





	We do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations applicable to our operations. We are subject to the laws and regulations which are generally applicable to business operations, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes.





	However, the telecommunications industry is highly regulated in China. PRC laws and regulations will be modified and updated from time to time by the China government. In addition, many PRC laws and regulations are subject to extensive interpretive power of governmental agencies and commissions, and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the future interpretation and application of these laws or regulations.










	Costs of Compliance with Environmental Laws





	We are not presently affected by and do not have any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws.








	Customers and Suppliers






	Our major customers are end users and corporate clients in Shanghai. Our suppliers are mainly termination partners and telecommunication players such as China TieTong Telecommunications ("CTT"), China Mobile and China Unicom and China Telecom.

	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief operating officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our chief operating officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.






	(b) Changes in Internal Controls.

	There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal period ended April 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.






	(c) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as amended. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:









	·




	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;










	·




	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and










	·




	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.









	Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992).





	Based on the Company's processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of April 30, 2016, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.





	This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation requirements by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2016.

	We were engaged to audit the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of REDtone Asia, Inc. and its subsidiaries, ("the Company") as of April 30, 2016 and May 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operation, stockholders'

	 

	equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.





	We were unable to evaluate correctness of the accounting treatment of one related party not being classified as variable interest entity. Had this related party been classified as variable interest entity, the consolidated balance sheet should have included this related party and we were unable to quantify the financial impact of such consolidation on the balance sheet and statements of operation. The outstanding balances of amount due to this related party derived from revenue and service costs for the years ended April 30, 2016 and May 31, 2015, appearing in the accompanying consolidated financial statements were and $28,771 and $54,792 respectively. The Company's records did not permit the application of other auditing procedures to obtain sufficient evidence regarding the correctness of the accounting treatment of amount due to the related party and such related parties transactions thereof.





	Since the Company did not provide sufficient appropriate evidence and we were not able to apply other auditing procedures to satisfy ourselves as to evaluate the correctness of the accounting treatment of the related party not being a variable interest entity, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion on these consolidated financial statements.

	Nantong Jiatong, Hongsheng and QBA were disposed of

	July 25, 2014

	. The corresponding results for years ended May 31, 2015 (up to disposal date) was reported as discontinued operations. See also Footnote 4.





	Prior to disposal of Hongsheng, the Company transferred its equity interest in Xin Chang to Huitong. The statutory registration was completed in September 2014.





	YuZhong, YuGuang, Haitai and FengCheng are new subsidiaries in previous financial year. See also Footnote 5.


	 


	NOTE 2 – PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2016 and year ended May 31, 2015 include the accounts of the Company, the Company's subsidiaries and VIEs (see Note 1). The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America, and all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority of the Company's operations is the Renminbi ("RMB"), while the reporting currency is the US Dollar.





	NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	(a) Economic and political risk





	The Company's major operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the political, economic, and legal environments in PRC may influence the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.





	The Company's major operations in the PRC are subject to considerations and significant risks typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, and legal environment. The Company's results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.





	(b) Cash and cash equivalents





	The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.





	(c) Accounts receivable and other receivables





	Trade receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.


	 




	F7












	Impairment on allowance for debts

	for the period ended April 30, 2016 and year ended May 31, 2015 amounted to $1

	96

	,

	138

	and $nil, respectively.





	(d) Property, plant and equipment





	Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to the statement of operations as incurred, whereas significant renewals and improvements are capitalized. The cost and the related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.





	The Company provides for depreciation of property, plant and equipment principally by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Plant and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives:


	                                     







	Computer and software




	 5 years






	Furniture, fixtures and equipment




	 5 years






	Motor vehicles




	 5 years






	Leasehold improvements




	 5 years






	Telecommunication equipment




	 10 years






	 


	Depreciation expense attributable to continuing operations for the period ended April 30, 2016 and year ended May 31, 2015 amounted to $379,941 and $541,142, respectively. Depreciation expense attributable to discontinued operations for the period ended April 30, 2016 and year ended May 31, 2015 amounted to $nil and $3,689, respectively.





	(e) Intangible assets





	IT license and software and operating license and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods of benefit, in 20 years. Customer base are amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years.





	The Company performs regular review of identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than the original Company policies. If such facts and circumstances exist, the Company regularly assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.





	Amortization expense attributable to continuing operations for the period ended April 30, 2016 and year ended May 31, 2015 amounted to $145,051 and $321,033, respectively.





	(f) Available-for-sale investments





	Investments in equity securities that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are recognized in the balance sheet at cost less impairment losses.





	(g) Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets





	The long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. Determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.





	There is $2,591,832 (2015: Nil) impairment loss recognized during the period ended April 30, 2016 and year ended May 31, 2015 respectively.


	 


	 




	F8











	(h) Income tax





	Income taxes are based on pre-tax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. The Company periodically assesses the need to establish valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets to the extent the Company no longer believes it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully utilized.





	The Company evaluates a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, no benefit is recognized.





	(i) Fair value of financial instruments





	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:


	 





	 




	Level 1—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.





	 





	 




	Level 2—Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.





	 





	 




	Level 3—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.








	We measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.





	(j) Revenue recognition





	The Company assesses appropriate revenue recognition policy for each type of operation according to ASC 605-45





	Revenue represents the invoiced value of services rendered and receivable during the year. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:







	Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,




	Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,




	The seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and




	Collectability is reasonably assured




	Revenue recognition policy for each of the major products and services:






	1.  




	Discounted call services for consumer (EMS) as follow:











	 




	Collaboration with CTT – Redtone China is appointed as the sole distributor for EMS and will recognize revenue when airtime is utilized by the consumer and the revenue recognized is on net basis which is computed based on a fixed sharing ratio of the total airtime utilized by consumers after netting of direct traffic termination cost and incidental expenses. Redtone China's role for Business Collaboration with China TieTong Telecommunications (CTT) would be as "Agent" as Redtone China is the sole distributor for EMS brand owned and controlled by CTT; and





	 




	F9








	 



	 





	 




	Collaboration with other telecommunication providers – Redtone China will act as a discounted consumer call Reseller whereby Redtone China will determine the service and package specification and pricing policies whereas China Unicom acts as a passive termination partner for call traffic.  Redtone China will pay China Unicom solely based on call traffic termination by China Unicom at a prescribed rate (defined as traffic termination costs on the books of Redtone China).  In this regard, Redtone China will recognize the revenue when the consumer utilizes airtime and the value recognized as revenue is the call charges gross value.    Redtone China's role for Business Collaboration with China Unicom would be as "Principal" as China Unicom is playing a passive role as traffic termination partner while Redtone China is fully responsible for the entire management of discounted call services








	As this is a prepaid product, there is an expiration date for the product sold. If the airtime is not utilized by the expiration date, which is currently one year from the activation date, it will be deemed expired and revenue will be recognized based on the remaining gross value of the expired prepaid product.


	 





	2.  




	Discounted call services for corporate as follow:











	☐




	Collaboration with CTT – the revenue recognize is the commission earned from distributing the discounted call services to corporate customer; and











	☐




	Collaboration with other telecommunication providers –the revenue recognized is the commission earned from distributing the discounted call services to corporate customer.











	3.  




	Reload services for prepaid mobile – revenue recognized is the commission earned.





	 






	4.





	Collaboration with Shanghai Huili Telecommunications Co., Ltd (


	"Huili


	") – Huili will act as


	"intermediary agent


	" to resell the call traffic termination by Redtone China. Huili will pay Redtone China the termination costs on the books of Redtone China.



	 






	 


	(k) Earnings per share





	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of April 30, 2016 and May 31, 2015, there were no dilutive securities outstanding.





	(l) Use of estimates





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.





	(m) Retirement benefits





	PRC mandates companies to contribute funds into the national retirement system, which benefits qualified employees based on where they were born within the country. The Company pays the required payment for qualified employees of the Company.





	(n) Foreign currency translation





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (US$). The functional currencies of the Company are the Hong Kong dollar (HK$) and the Renminbi (RMB), respectively. Capital accounts of the financial statements are translated into United States dollars from HK$ or RMB at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of balance sheet date. Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate of the year. The translation rates are as follows:

	On July 21, 2005, the PRC changed its foreign currency exchange policy from a fixed RMB/US$ exchange rate into a flexible rate under the control of the PRC's government.





	The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at the rates used in translation.





	(o) Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	The Financial Accounting Standards Board and other entities issued new or modifications to, or interpretations of, existing accounting guidance during the period.  Management has carefully considered the new pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any other new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company's reported financial position or operations in the near term.





	The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. No new standards had any material effect on these financial statements. The accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential effect on these consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future restatement of these consolidated financial statements because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to

	April 30, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued.






	NOTE 4 – DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATION





	On July 25, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to dispose of its entire equity interest in Hongsheng, a VIE subsidiary, to Guotai Investment Holdings Limited at a total cash consideration of approximately $4.54 million.





	Pursuant to the agreement, Hongsheng shall transfer all its operations, assets and liabilities other than investment in QBA prior to the completion of the above transaction. Therefore, the entire arrangement is to dispose of the shell of Hongsheng together with the entire interest in QBA.

	Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of the VIEs and can have assets transferred freely out of the VIEs without restrictions. Therefore, the Company considers that there is no asset of VIEs that can only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves of VIEs as of April 30, 2016 and May 31, 2015. Since the VIEs are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC Company Law, creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. There is currently no contractual arrangement that would require the Company to provide additional financial support to the VIEs. As the Company is conducting certain businesses mainly through its VIEs, the Company may provide such support on a discretionary basis in the future, which could expose the Company to a loss.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION  NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  We are principally involved in the business of offering discounted call services for end users and corporate segment and paperless reload services for prepaid mobile air-time reload for end users in Shanghai covering all three major telecommunication operators namely China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.  We believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant accounting policies, as described in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The Company has adopted a revenue recognition policy for each type of operation according to ASC 605-45.  Revenue represents the invoiced value of services rendered and receivable during the year. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:   Persuasive evidence an arrangement exists;   Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;   The seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and   Collectability is reasonably assured.  Revenue recognition policy for each of the major products and services:  1. Discounted call services for consumer (EMS) as follows:  � Collaboration with China Tie Tong Telecommunications ("CTT") - REDtone China is appointed as the sole distributor for EMS and will recognize revenue when airtime is utilized by the consumer and revenue is recognized on a net basis which is computed based on a fixed sharing ratio of the total airtime utilized by consumers after netting the direct traffic termination costs and incidental expenses. REDtone China's role for Business Collaboration with CTT is as an "Agent" as REDtone China is the sole distributor for the EMS brand owned and controlled by CTT; and  � Collaboration with other telecommunication providers - REDtone China will act as a discounted consumer call Reseller whereby REDtone China determines the service and package specification and the pricing policy whereas China Unicom acts as a passive termination partner for call traffic. REDtone China will pay China Unicom solely based on call traffic termination by China Unicom at a prescribed rate (defined as traffic termination cost on the books of REDtone China). In this regard, REDtone China will recognize revenue when airtime is utilized by the consumer and the revenue recognized is the gross value of the call charges. REDtone China's role for Business Collaboration with China Unicom is that of "Principal" as China Unicom is playing a passive role as the traffic termination partner while REDtone China is fully responsible for the entire management of the discounted call services  As this is a prepaid product, there is an expiration date for the product sold. If the airtime is not utilized by the expiration date, which is currently one year from the activation date, the product will be deemed to be expired and the revenue recognized at the time is the remaining gross value of the expired prepaid product.  2. Discounted call services for corporate consumers is as follows:  � Collaboration with CTT - the revenue recognized is the commission earned from distributing the discounted call services to corporate customers; and  � Collaboration with other telecommunication providers -the revenue recognized is the commission earned from distributing the discounted call services to corporate customers.  3. Reload services for prepaid mobile services - revenue recognized is the commission earned.  4. Collaboration with Shanghai Huili Telecommunications Co., Ltd ("Huili") - Huili will act as "intermediary agent" to resell the call traffic termination by REDtone China. Huili will pay REDtone China the termination costs on the books of REDtone China.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Company does not expect that the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements will have any material impact on its financial statements.  Year-to-date Results of Operations  Year-to-date Results for Three-month period ended July 31, 2016 as Compared to period ended July 31, 2015  The following table summarizes the results of our operations during the three-month periods ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, and associated percentage changes for comparisons purposes.
