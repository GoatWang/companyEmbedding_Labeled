Packaging is an essential   element in introducing your product to the market. While you may have a   very good product but your competitor has a more attractive packaging,   chances are you lose on your potential customers. 
We at Licton Industrial   aspire to be your partner by providing you with attractive, reliable and   affordable packaging. This website introduces you to a variety of   plastic packaging products. As an added service to the rapidly changing   needs of the market, we have commissioned an artist to create or modify   existing art works.
Plastic bags are a familiar component   of modern living-whether for business or personal purposes.  As a low   cost, light weight but strong and durable packaging material, millions   of people around the world consume and dispose of this bag everyday. 
As a leading plastic packaging   manufacturer in the Philippines, we are aware of the need to help   nourish our planet and reduce global warming while using convenient and   affordable plastics.  As part of our goal to continually grow and serve   the needs of our customers, we are now producing OXO-BIODEGRADABLE   plastics, which are made by blending an additive into the plastic that   causes its molecular structure to breakdown when exposed to heat or   sunlight. The degradation time varies depending on the amount of   exposure to degradation promoters (sunlight, heat and microorganisms). 
Once it becomes litter, it   could degrade in under 12 months compared to conventional plastic bags   that will remain around for decades thus saving valuable landfill space.   Oxo-biodegradable plastics have been the industry standard for many   years now in many industrialized countries.
Armed with this   innovation, we can help you and your business save the environment.    Call us now for more details about this breakthrough technology.

Volume Licensing for Microsoft Products and Online ServicesThe licensing resources on this page define the terms and conditions for the products and Online Services you purchase through
							Microsoft Volume Licensing programs.On this page: PT | OST | SPUR | SLA | ISVProduct TermsBeginning in July 2015, a new document called the Product Terms replaces both the Product Use Rights and the Product List. Together with the program agreement, Product Terms contains all the terms and conditions for how you purchase licenses for software and online services through Microsoft Volume Licensing programs, with the exception of the Microsoft Online Subscription and Cloud Solution Provider programs, as well as how you may deploy and use software licensed under those programs. Information on how to deploy and use Online Services continues to be found in the Online Services Terms (OST) for all programs. Now in one document, Product Terms provides the same information regarding availability of new products, discontinuation products, available promotions, point values, product migration paths, notes and other information specific to products. The consolidation, along with enhanced navigation, makes it easier to understand how to buy and use Microsoft products without diminishing your product use rights. The Product Terms document is updated monthly. The current and archived editions of Product Terms are available for download. For more information, read the Product Terms FAQ.
