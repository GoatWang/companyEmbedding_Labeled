Following our presentation, there will be a Q&A session.I will now hand over to Arti for his comments. Please, Arti, go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Arti Ots, Kcell Joint Stock Company - CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much, Irina. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me kick off with some of the progress and challenges we faced in Q2. So firstly, we have been talking about the cautious optimism in both macro field as well as on the mobile marketing in Kazakhstan. We can now say that we are optimistic about the trends we see going to the second -- from second quarter to the third quarter, especially supported by the commercial activities we have already executed and what we have in front. But I'll come back to this main message a little bit later in a separate slide.So firstly, as I mentioned, we have price adjustments starting to show already positive impact we had launched in June and fully coming in effect in the middle of July. We also see that the cost initiatives we have taken during this year and also last year are really giving an impact and that keeps the cost level in a good controlled pace.Also happy to announce that now we offer our 4G services in 7 more cities and more will be to come, so we cover 41% of the population already with the 4G services with the growing trends month-on-month.Let me just touch on B2B for a second here, as I'm not coming back in the later stage. On the B2B side, we have year-on-year growth of around 10% and the main contributor to this growth is our Business Solutions, which grew year-on-year 35% and what we consider as a key strategic step moving forward. This is part of our strategy and so far it's going exactly as we have planned.Last but not least, we paid out dividends in June, as was announced and planned earlier.On the negative side, we closed the tax audit -- that Trond will talk a little bit later -- with the total claim of KZT 9 billion. We had already made provision last December and Trond will comment on how it impacts this provision.Moving forward to the commercial side of our business, the key trend shift for this year was that we are focusing our commercial activities more towards the value creation and not much on stabilizing the subscriber market share, which we consider fairly stable now. We came in with a slight increase on the subscribers quarter-on-quarter and more than 230,000 customers year-on-year. We feel that it's the level that is comfortable to us not to be more aggressive in the market in a way to potentially initiate another spillover in the market.Read MoreOn the value creation side, we have now announced the closure of the legacy tariff effective from 18 of July and we already announced earlier the price adjustments to our legacy tariffs. And these legacy tariffs amount around 40% of our revenues and the information about the price adjustments are available in our website.Also I would like to announce our progress on the OTT field. We have now launched our new Mobi Press service, which is -- which give customers ability to read newspapers, so in the mobile, and also the mobimoney. So now we can say that we have a complete portfolio of services, of digital services that we feel comfortable on moving forward and develop further as the key differentiator.Going forward, as part of our digital initiatives we have now launched artificial intelligence based call center for our Activ subscribers. You might be surprised that has been a very big success. The artificial intelligence based call center is learning the language, both Kazakh and Russian everyday and is able to serve our customers better and better. As I said, this is just the first step on our wider digitalization initiatives, which we will cover in our next quarterly call in more detail.Also last but not least, as part of our handsets/monobrands sales activities, we have launched a new line of smartphones for our -- for low-end segment or low-end smartphone segment, which should contribute positively to the smartphone penetration, which now have reached close to 55% on our base.So moving forward to financials, you see in quarter two improving trends compared to Q1 and Q4 when we again look it from the comparative basis. Trond will comment on that. So let me just go through the highlights of the Q2.On the service revenue side, we are 1% behind year-on-year, while data is growing on almost 10% year-on-year. Also the handset sales is now fully our own handset sales, so we don't do anymore any wholesale. So it's going directly through our sales -- own sales channels. That's why you don't see much as improvement compared to last year. But when we look the contract phones sold through our own sales channels, then the growth is remarkable, it almost doubled year-on-year.EBITDA margin remains depressed I would say compared to last year. Here we will see improving trends supported by the price adjustments going on to next quarter and the second half of the year.So moving to the first half of 2017 summary, it basically reflects the same trends. Year-on-year we still face a decline on the service revenue. We can also now feel with a reasonable confidence that we have reached an inflection point and the second half should be stronger than the first half of this year.By saying that, I would like to hand over to Trond for greater details on the -- some of the operational KPIs and also financials to walk you through the logic and thinking behind it. Trond -- go ahead, Trond.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Trond Moe, Kcell Joint Stock Company - CFO and Finance Director [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Arti, and good morning or good afternoon to everyone from my side as well. Let's start on Slide 6, where we look -- kind of look a bit closer on our revenue trend in Q2. We report a growth quarter-on-quarter, and although it's still a very small decrease year-on-year, overall we can see the improvement in those numbers and the trend is positive.As you can see from the chart, we report an increase of 1.4% quarter-on-quarter in net sales, while our service revenue was up 1.8% quarter-on-quarter.At the same time, if you look at the B2B revenues, they continue to rise. And if you look at the Business Solutions part of that, which is the non-core mobile services, we report an impressing 33% quarter-on-quarter growth and 35% year-on-year increase. Our B2C revenue remains broadly stable year-on-year, which we consider a good result in this time and on the same level as the fourth quarter of 2017.Moving then to Slide 7, let's look a little bit closer at the trends that I have mentioned. Here we see the quarterly result compared to the same quarter one year earlier. You can see that the trend had been positive for some time now and we are now almost at the same revenue level as one year ago. Data revenues are growing faster, but please note that since the majority of our revenues now come from fixed monthly price bundles, split between voice and data is more of an accounting allocation issue than a real trend.On Slide 8, let's look at absolute data usage and revenue. Our data traffic grew by 58% year-on-year as smartphone penetration continued increasing and reached 55% compared with 50% at the end of 2016. The reduction in average revenue per megabyte is explained by more revenues now coming from bundle packages with high data allowances.Data revenue was up 9% year-on-year and accounted for 31% of total revenues. But again, please note that this is mostly allocated by accounting rules. The way we do it is based on historical usage, which gives us the formula allocating 67% of bundle revenue to data. This formula may of course be revised as usage patterns change going forward.Okay, moving then to Slide 9, you can see our operational performance. MOUs increased to 231 in Q2 compared to 220 in the previous quarter. Total voice traffic in Q2 rose by 1.6% against Q2 of 2016 and by 5.1% versus Q1 of 2017, while Q2 ARMUs held quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.Blended APRU was up 1.5% quarter-on-quarter, a decrease by 2.2% compared to Q2 of 2016. And as you can see, our subscriber base grew by 244,000 versus the same quarter 1 year ago. This increased mainly due to the promotional campaigns done in the period.On Slide 10 then, you will see the summary of our financial highlights for Q2 and the first 6 months of 2017. As I already mentioned, we have a slight decrease in revenues, but we do see a positive trend on the top line. Costs have grown during the last year, but these are mainly due to volume increases and data capacity costs, especially as we have a significant growth in our 4G network and corresponding 4G traffic. In addition, we had some positive FX effects last year, which also contributed to the difference. On other cost elements not directly associated with network and traffic growth, we keep them well under control.On net income, the difference reflects the price or the cost increases I just mentioned and also an increase in the tax audit provision following the completion of the tax audit for the period of 2012 to '15. The tax authority has now presented us with a total claim of KZT 9 billion for this period, of which KZT 5.8 billion is for unpaid taxes and KZT 3.2 billion represents fines and penalties for late payments. It covers a range of different taxes. One of the biggest elements are related to VAT on written-off equipment following earlier network swaps. Another big element is related to withholding tax from the IPO back in 2012, where the tax authorities claim that withholding tax should have been paid on retained earnings that were transferred into the new joint stock company.This money of course never left Kazakhstan and we therefore consider this part of the claim to be unjustified and we do intend to dispute this and a number of other claims through the available mechanisms to us, including court litigation.We therefore consider it unlikely that this full amount of the claim of KZT 9 billion will become payable following the appeal process. But for prudency reasons, we have made an additional provision now in Q2 of KZT 2.7 billion, this in addition to the provision we made in Q4 last year of KZT 3.9 billion.On the CapEx side, we are now in line with our previous guiding of modest CapEx spend even as we continue to rollout 4G in an efficient manner through a network sharing arrangement.Moving then to Slide 11, we can see the Kcell EBITDA performance quarter-on-quarter. And as we have already discussed, our EBITDA and EBITDA margin decreased year-on-year. The decline in absolute EBITDA year-on-year was mainly due to the volume increases and the data capacity cost that I just mentioned.Looking at quarter-on-quarter performance, still we can see improvement as EBITDA was 3% higher versus Q1 with EBITDA margin of 37.4% versus 37% respectively.And with that, I'm happy to hand it back to Arti to talk a little bit more about our ongoing initiatives and expectations for the future and especially the second half of the year. Arti?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Arti Ots, Kcell Joint Stock Company - CEO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much, Trond. So let me walk you through or give you an update, also for the ones who attended our Investor Day. So these are the projects that we run both for cost as well as for then revenue initiatives. So just a short update. I'm not going through all it in detail. You can find the details on our IR website about these projects from the Investor Day presentation.But a few updates, firstly, on the convergent billing. We had some issues previously. Most of these issues are closed and we are moving forward with the Phase 2 of this project to migrate our prepaid customers also within a year's time to the new convergent billing system. And this effectively gives us a strategic advantage to start migrating the customers from the pre-paid to postpaid or in Kcell terms from Activ brand to the higher value Kcell brand.On the digital transformation, not too many updates at the moment. So I mentioned the first green initiatives what we have done on replacing human call center with artificial intelligence based call center. You will hear more updates on that program in our next quarterly call.Moving forward, we are in the process of restructuring our first line or field line maintenance as we speak. We have number of good options and opportunities on the table and this program is going as planned.The last two are more related with network. On transmission, we are actively seeking opportunities to restructure the way we buy transmission capacity from buying a capacity to basically lease or build model. We're also progressing as planned. It's too early to speak about concrete results. But whenever we get the concrete offers on the table and make the necessary decisions, we will come back to you immediately.And on the network sharing, like Trond mentioned, also the network sharing from Kcell side and also from Beeline side around 4G is going as planned. We have ongoing 2G, 3G pilot projects already ongoing. We expect the results from the pilot projects to be ready by September over this year.So all-in-all, initiatives are in line with our expectations and that should give us from the both cost and the revenue perspective more solid foundation for next year.Let me update you also on network. As Trond mentioned, our modest CapEx budget is executed in a good way. Now we can already report a 4G coverage of 41%. And as we have said earlier, our 4G investments go primarily to the places where we see the higher number of 4G handsets available. So effectively build a network where we see either potential or already demand.The CapEx for second quarter increased and the CapEx-to-sales ratio was around 11%. We intend to now swap our cities with Beeline, so the year-end target of 4G network will be around 48% to 49% and this is also in line with our initial plan. As said earlier, the 4G has really picked up very quickly, and in the cities where we have 4G network like in Almaty, Astana and some other bigger cities, the 4G traffic already amounts close to half of the whole traffic.So by that, we move to guiding for the full year. We remain optimistic about the second half of the year and also the guiding for the full-year related to that will be flat service revenue and absolute EBITDA compared to last year and CapEx-to-sales ratio at low teens level, of course excluding the non-recurring items or strategic projects if any.So by that, I would like to finish and give the word back to Irina to facilitate the Q&A session.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Irina Shol, [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Arti. Operator, we are ready for questions.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) We have a question now from Dilya Ibragimova from Citi.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dilya Ibragimova, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I had two questions please. First is on your archive tariffs that you mentioned you have. Some of them have been closed by now. I just wanted to clarify whether those tariffs improved Hallo, Kazakhstan archive tariffs, and if not, what your expectations regarding those, whether you're discussing this with the regulator or just any update on Hallo, Kazakhstan tariffs would be great? And the second question relates to your EBITDA guidance. Essentially, flat EBITDA for the full-year implies that EBITDA growth in the second half should be at least flat. But the EBITDA has been declining in the first half. What makes your -- or EBITDA in the first half has been declining faster than the revenue decline because of the cost pressure you're mentioning. What makes you confident in you being able to stabilize it then in the second half? Is there -- are there any other cost initiatives you've taken or maybe you think EBITDA can stabilize as soon as revenue stabilize? Any color would be great. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Arti Ots, Kcell Joint Stock Company - CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Firstly, let me answer the first question regarding Hallo, Kazakhstan and then Trond will take the -- take you -- walk you through the thinking around the EBITDA improvement. To answer directly, the Hallo, Kazakhstan is not on that list what we have closed. We have closed quite a bit of the regional tariffs and that's effectively in line with our digitalization initiatives and also the swap to a new billing system to just make it more simpler to our customers and also as a project to execute. When it comes to Hallo, Kazakhstan, we feel confident about the price increases we have applied. So the gross margin of this product is in line with our expectations or basically in line with the gross margin of other bundles. So we have no reason to close this product at the very moment when customers are ready to pay a higher price for it. So in that respect, it's not the problem itself. So it's -- Hallo, Kazakhstan is part of the tariffs that -- where the prices were increased just recently. Trond, the second question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Trond Moe, Kcell Joint Stock Company - CFO and Finance Director [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, on the guidance. I think it's -- you're doing the right math of course. And if you compare the first half of the year with first half of last year, you see that we are behind. So that means that when we signal flat EBITDA and flat revenue for the full-year, it means that we do expect that second half for this year will be better than second half of first year both on revenue side and on EBITDA side. This is mainly driven by revenue increases related to tariff adjustments. We do see already effects from some of those that were announced, so we feel fairly confident on that side. On the cost side, we don't expect the cost to increase that much anymore in second half. The cost increases we saw already were mainly driven by traffic and capacity increases, but also on pricing of those elements; for example, pricing our energy on our sites, which is normally done in the first half of the year, and also pricing on the internet fees that we receive. And we don't expect any more that the -- price increases in the second half. So the short answer is that less cost increases, but mainly revenue increases in the second half of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) We have no further questions at the moment.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Arti Ots, Kcell Joint Stock Company - CEO [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So I think that the holiday season is starting, so I want to wish everybody a very nice vacation. I hope that on the next quarterly call we can deliver some of this positive news we talked this morning and come back to the growth track.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Irina Shol, [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. I think that concludes our today's presentation. Thank you and good-bye.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.
