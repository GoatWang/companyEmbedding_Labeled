As a regional contractor with a local supply chain, employing local people and a longstanding commitment to the local communities in which we work, we are able to create a positive lasting legacies for future generations. Our unrivalled levels of customer service and uncompromised quality has resulted in the Midas Group going from strength to strength, despite sometimes harsh market challenges.
Every Midas employee is fully committed to delivering industry leading performance & customer service, and our customers are at the heart of everything we do. We survey customer satisfaction at three key project stages to ensure we meet and exceed expectations and currently the average score at Practical Completion is 83%, measured against our target benchmark of 80%. The fact that over ¾ of turnover results from repeat business is testament to our customer commitment.
Our vision is to be widely acclaimed for industry leading performance and customer service
By:


Having great people in high performing teams;


Forming long-term partnerships with customers;


Consistently delivering leading edge performance;

Sustainability
Building for Generations to Come 
The Midas Group is committed to the creation and maintenance of buildings that conserve rather than waste energy and aspires to build them in a way that minimises their environmental impact now and for future generations. By adopting current best practice and by continually seeking to improve, we will manage our business so that it delivers long-term value to our people, customers, supply chain and the communities in which we work.
We believe that demonstrating continuous improvement in sustainability best practice is becoming evermore important to our customers. Meeting the social and environmental challenges of the 21st century are of increasing significance and we recognise that we must continue to develop a culture at Midas that places sustainability alongside other key deliverables of safety, customer service and quality.
Having recognised that having an effective sustainability strategy is crucial to continued success, the Group launched ‘7-Steps to Sustainability'.
This strategic document sets out practical steps for delivering a sustainable and responsible business model through our core activities, services and supply chain and embodies an aspiration to be innovative and consistently improve what we do.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Since the company was formed in 1976 we have been committed to socially responsible activity – long before it was given the name CSR! Today the Midas Group remains committed to ethical behaviour and sustainable economic development, while improving the quality of life of its workforce and their families, as well as the local community and society at large. It is fundamental to who we are and how we operate as a company.

Our commitment was formalised by the publishing of the Midas Group Corporate Social Responsibility Mission Statement and Policy in 2006.

Click here to view or download our CSR Mission Statement and Policy

People are at the heart of our business – our staff, customers, supply chain and the communities in which we work. We value all these relationships and are proud to have a reputation that sets us apart. Initiatives that benefit society and local communities feature strongly in our approach to corporate responsibility and include not only financial assistance but also contributions of time and resource. We actively encourage participation in community projects, with staff undertaking many hours of voluntary work and charity fundraising.

In 2012 we introduced Community Engagement Week, giving staff the opportunity to support worthwhile projects in our local communities. Every year, dozens of projects are organised; staff from across the Midas Group are able to nominate projects and together in their regions choose which to support, donating their time to give something back to the local community.





Environmental responsibility
We're mindful of our responsibility to protect the environment. We strive to incorporate environmental and social considerations into our procurement processes, recognising that it is our responsibility to encourage our supply chain to minimise negative environmental and social effects. To help review and monitor the resources we use we introduced a Sustainable Procurement Policy that encourages our employees and supply chain to review their consumption of resources such that we source only what we need. Knowing where materials come from and identifying the 'chain of custody' is very important. It is our preference to procure products that are manufactured and can be used in an environmentally and socially responsible way and which are accredited to a recognised environmental standard.
We are committed to reducing waste, re-using and recycling where possible and ultimately sending zero waste to landfill. We work hard to find new opportunities to reuse or recycle waste materials through efficient design and careful management of the construction process.

Technological developments
Committed to leading the way with technological developments we are a member of buildingSMART and are proud to maintain international standards for Open BIM. This universal approach to the collaborative design, realisation and operation of buildings is based on open standards and workflows and is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a building. Bringing together all the information about a building’s design, construction and maintenance allows us to deliver more efficient, cost effective, sustainable solutions for our customers.
 






Health & Safety
The Midas Group is an industry leader when it comes to Health & Safety and we are extremely proud to have been awarded a ROSPA Presidents Award for the second time as well as an 11th consecutive Gold Medal. It our policy, in line with the UK Contractor Group, that all Midas employees hold a valid CSCS card, relevant to their professional discipline.The Health and Safety of our staff, the communities in which we work, our supply chain and the wider public dominates the agenda at the Midas Group. We know that only through taking a robust and progressive stance on Health & Safety can we then concentrate on the organisation’s core deliverable of helping to create communities.

We’re only as good as the company we keep and so we’re delighted that over 80% of our turnover results from repeat business.
Our long-standing customer relationships demonstrate our commitment to industry leading performance and customer service and the trust our customers have in the Midas Group on their important projects. 
Of course everyone claims to be great but not all construction groups are the same. Here are just a few nice comments that we've received from clients over the years.





"We are determined not only to provide a top quality product, on time and at low cost, but also to ensure that our customers experience a positive and fulfilling customer journey."
