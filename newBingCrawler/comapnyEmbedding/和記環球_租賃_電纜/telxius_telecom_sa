 Spanish telecom behemoth Telefonica SA TEF  plans to file for an initial public offering (IPO) of its infrastructure division Telxius in the second half of 2016. The company may also consider a share market listing (an IPO) for its U.K. wireless unit O2 or even sell it by the end of this year. In May 2016, Bloomberg reports stated that Telefonica is mulling over an IPO for Telxius and O2 UK. In the meantime, the company has been grappling with issues such as the Brexit, Britain's vote to leave the European Union, which delayed the process. Since May 2016, Telefonica has been in talks with several banks over the Telxius IPO. Formed in Feb 2016, the division has been set up to manage the company's infrastructure assets. At present, Telxius oversees about 15,000 wireless towers and an international submarine-cable network covering 31,000 kilometers (19,000 miles). More assets are likely to be assigned to Telxius over time. Telefonica aims to raise around €4-€5 billion ($4.5-$5.6 billion) from the Telxius IPO. The spin-off of an infrastructure unit is not new in the global telecom space. Earlier, America Movil SAB AMX  had spun-off its Telesite infrastructure division and Telecom Italia SpA TI  also followed suit. The Telxius IPO is of utmost importance to Telefonica after the European Union telecom regulator blocked the proposed sale of its O2 unit in the U.K. to 3UK of Hutchison Whampoa. The deal was worth around $14.9 billion. Telefonica's debt currently stands at approximately €52.2 billion (around $58 billion). The company had planned to reduce its debt burden through the divestment of its O2 division. However, the plan fell through as the transaction failed to materialize. Telefonica is now reportedly planning an IPO for its O2 division. As of Jun 30, 2016, total customer access lines of Telefonica were approximately 341.9223 million, down 1.8% year over year. Notably, in the Latin American markets, Telefonica competes with large global telecom operators like AT&T Inc. T  and America Movil. According to some industry watchers, Telefonica may now be compelled to vend some of its core assets to raise cash and pay-off debt. Otherwise its debt rating may be badly affected.  Nevertheless, management expects free cash flow and operating income before depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2017 than in 2016. At this juncture, proceeds from the Telxius IPO can help Telefonica clear part of its outstanding debt. Telefonica currently carries a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).   TELEFONICA S.A.

UPDATE: Telefonica Scraps Telxius IPO After Weak Investor Demand

By Ruth David, Manuel Baigorri, Rodrigo Orihuela, Bloomberg
Telefonica SA canceled an initial public offering of its infrastructure unit, Telxius Telecom SA, after demand from investors proved inadequate.
Telefonica will continue “to analyze strategic alternatives” for Telxius, the Spanish carrier said in a statement Thursday. The decision to call off the sale was reached together with the banks that were managing the IPO, the company said.
Telefonica and its advisers had been scrambling to rescue the deal, weighing lowering the price range or reducing the size of the deal amid insufficient demand for the stock, people familiar have said.
Investors balked at paying the asking price of 12 euros to 15 euros a share and the company and its banks were unable to find a solution. A canceled sale leaves Telefonica, Spain’s most indebted non-financial company, with shrinking options to reduce its 52.6 billion euro ($59 billion) debt pile and sustain its credit rating while still maintaining dividends.
While Telefonica had sought a valuation of as much as 3.75 billion euros for Telxius in a sale of as much as 40 percent of the unit, shareholders struggled to value the company’s submarine-cable assets and pressed for a lower price from such a motivated seller, people familiar with the matter have said.

Telefonica SA (TDE)



Telefonica SA

Agreement for the sale of stake of Telxius

RNS Number : 4061X Telefonica SA 21 February 2017  

 
 
 
TELEFÓNICA, S.A. (herein after "Telefónica") as provided in article 228 of the Spanish Stock Market Act (Ley del Mercado de Valores), hereby reports the following
 
 
SIGNIFICANT EVENT
 
 
 
Following the Significant Event published on February 10, 2017, Telefónica has reached an agreement for  the sale of up to 40% of the total share capital of Telxius Telecom, S.A.U. to Taurus Bidco S.à.r.l. (hereafter, "KKR", entity managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.), for a total amount of €1,275 million (€ 12.75 per share).
 
The aforementioned agreement includes a Purchase Agreement for the sale of 62 million shares (representing 24.8% of the total capital stock) of Telxius Telecom, S.A.U. for a price of € 790.5 million, as well as stock options over 38 million shares (representing 15.2% of the total share capital) for a price of at least  € 484.5 million.
 
These options correspond to a call option exercisable by KKR and to a put option exercisable by Telefónica upon maturity of the call option.
 
The closing is subject to obtaining the corresponding regulatory approvals. The exercise window of the options would take place during the fourth quarter of 2017, provided that regulatory approvals have been obtained on that date.
 
The transaction implies an Enterprise Value of €3,678 million including debt, and an Equity Value of €3,188 million (€12.75 per share), which confirms the valuation established by Telefónica in the prospectus for the offering of shares registered on September 20, 2016 for the same perimeter of assets and the implicit multiple of company value over EBITDA would be 11.4 times the EBITDA 2017 of Telxius(1)
 
This Agreement will have no impact on Telefonica´s Group consolidated results as it consists on the sale of a minority stake, maintaining Telefónica the control over Telxius.
 
 
This operation is part of Telefónica Group's asset portfolio management policy, based on a strategy of value creation and strategic positioning. Likewise, it also complements the objective of organic debt reduction, in a growing cash flow scenario.

Telefonica Said to Mull Selling Telxius Stake After IPO Flop

By Manuel Baigorri, Esteban Duarte and David Hellier, Bloomberg
Telefonica SA is considering selling stakes in its infrastructure business after an initial public offering of the unit, Telxius Telecom SA, fell through last month, people familiar with the matter said.
The Spanish phone company is speaking to advisers and is exploring whether to offer competitors or private-equity firms a holding in the entire unit or its components, which include wireless towers and undersea cables, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. No final decisions have been made and the company could decide against the sale, they said.
Cellnex Telecom SA Chief Executive Officer Tobias Martinez said in an interview Thursday he’d consider investing in Telxius if it became available. Towers are an increasingly popular target for investors and companies, like Cellnex, that specialize in buying up infrastructure when phone companies sell down to cut costs. The submarine cable business, which transmits calls and data between countries, proved harder to value for investors in the IPO, the people said.
