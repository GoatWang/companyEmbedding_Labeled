Having a product in their store that provides cash-out services and serves as a mobile point of sale solution in a country with limited financial infrastructure cements their relationship with MoneyOnMobile," said Ranjeet Oak, Managing Director of MoneyOnMobile's India subsidiary.Percentage Change in Revenue Categories by Transaction Type since December 2016  Category   Jan-17   Feb-17   Mar-17   Apr-17   May-17     Domestic Remittance / MOM ATM   133%   10%   42%   19%   86%     Mobile / TV Top-Up   -9%   -25%   3%   -6%   3%     All Other   3%   -17%   14%   -15%   16%  MoneyOnMobile generates revenue in two ways, depending on the transaction type: either a fixed fee per transaction, or a percentage discount on the amount of the transaction. The figures above are grouped based on the commission type MoneyOnMobile receives. Domestic remittance and MOM ATM generate revenues for the retailer and MoneyOnMobile based on a fixed fee for each transaction, regardless of transaction size. Mobile and TV top-up generate revenues to retailers and MoneyOnMobile based on a percentage commission of the amount of the transaction.About MoneyOnMobile, Inc.MoneyOnMobile, Inc. is a global mobile payments technology and processing company offering mobile payment services through its Indian subsidiary.

	We are offering an aggregate of      shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and warrants to purchase an aggregate of      shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $     per share and $     per warrant. The warrants have an exercise price of $     per share and expire five years from the date of issuance. The shares and warrants will be sold and trade separately.

There is no established public trading market for the warrants. No assurance can be given that a trading market will develop for the warrants.

	Our technology also allows consumers to deposit funds into their mobile wallet or to perform a financial transaction through its robust agent network which includes over 330,000 retail locations as of December 31, 2016. Consumers use their mobile phones to make certain routine payments for utilities or to transfer currency to other consumers using text-messaging and mobile application technology. The license to operate has been issued by the Reserve Bank of India and is the property of My Mobile Payments Limited (MMPL), which maintains custody of customers funds in accordance with Indias regulations. An
	affiliate of MoneyOnMobile, Digital Payments Processing Limited (DPPL), owns and operates the retail agent network, the customer support call center, the sales support functions, and the intellectual property necessary to process transactions.


	MoneyOnMobile representatives Messrs. Montgomery and Arey are two of the four members of DPPLs board of directors. Mr. Montgomery is Chairman of the DPPL board with a tie-breaking vote. Mr. Montgomery also is one of 6 members of MMPLs board.


	Indian Payment Processing Market


	In India, the majority of personal payments are made in person with cash, and most routine services are paid in advance. Effecting the simplest transactions (e.g., buying cell-phone minutes, paying for cable or satellite television time, and paying electric or water bills) can be both time consuming and inconvenient. Typically each service has its own payment location, meaning travel can be significant and waiting lines can be long. In addition, workers moving from the country to the city find the process of sending money home in cash or by courier can be risky, unreliable, and expensive. It is difficult to confirm receipt of
	the funds transfer, and the recipient may experience significant delays in receiving the money.





	MoneyOnMobile Business Model


	In India, consumers are often required to prepay for certain utilities, such as mobile phone services or their electricity, and because bank accounts and credit cards are only used by a small portion of the Indian population. Currently, there are approximately 29 million credit cards in use for a population of approximately 1.3 billion people. Consumers typically prepay for their utilities with cash, either directly to utility providers or through distributors.


	MoneyOnMobile offers electronic wallet services (M-wallet), similar to carrying a prepaid debit card, using the consumers mobile phone. MoneyOnMobile is the first provider in India to have a multi-lingual app for a service in this category. By using this application, customers, through our robust agent network, can pay for goods and services and send money anytime and anywhere. MoneyOnMobile service uses cell telephone numbers to identify the consumer.


	The MoneyOnMobile service launched in April 2011 and as of June 30, 2016 has provided service to more than 170 million unique phone number users, processing over $227 million in transaction volume in fiscal year 2016. MoneyOnMobile is ranked as one of the top mobile money providers globally based on the

	number of unregistered users who used the mobile money service as compiled by GSMAs 2015 Global Adoption Survey. MoneyOnMobile also announced the launch of its domestic mobile money order service for customers in January 2015. MMPL currently has a license to operate a payments system received from the Reserve Bank of India. Renewal is required in October 2018, which we expect to receive.


	MoneyOnMobile acts as an intermediary between:






	


	Utility providers;




	MoneyOnMobile purchases utility units, such as mobile phone minutes, at wholesale rates and resells these units to distributors. MoneyOnMobile maintains a balance of these units held for resale. Additionally, we process utility bill payments made by consumers.






	


	Retailers/mobile money agents;




	For businesses, MoneyOnMobile acts as an intermediary, a single vendor providing mobile payment solutions to most cellular and DTH providers, allowing a small retailer to sell minutes from any provider. Individual retailers are able to execute retailer assisted transactions with consumers to provide all available services.






	


	Consumers;




	The consumer is able to digitize their cash into the MoneyOnMobile system leveraging our agent network. This occurs when the consumer pays cash at any of our independent retailer stores, which is then credited to the consumers M-wallet. To move funds from the users account to another individuals account, a text message to the MoneyOnMobile network tells who and what amount to pay. The amount is instantly deducted from the senders account and credited to the recipients bank account. Both parties receive a confirmation within seconds of the money transfer.


	Additionally, once a consumer has established a MoneyOnMobile electronic wallet account, they can use MoneyOnMobiles technology to facilitate peer-to-peer or non-distributor-related transactions with other parties that have MoneyOnMobile accounts, including other retailers, utilities and other MoneyOnMobile consumers. A consumer's M-wallet balance can be used to pay for utility bills, send money across the country, buy airtime minutes and purchase travel tickets at any of the 330,000 retail locations who are part of our network. MoneyOnMobile earns a transaction fee for these services.


	Short Term Strategic Goals and Objectives


	During the next 12 months, our strategy is to establish MoneyOnMobile as the industry leader for mobile payments to the unbanked population in India. The fundamental short-term goals and objectives of our business strategy include the following:






	


	Leverage our intellectual property portfolio to create value.








	


	Collaborate with leading eCommerce merchants.








	


	Develop and maintain strategic and development partnerships within our industry segments.








	


	Expand our commercialization capabilities, initially by internally developing our own marketing and sales force.




	Recent Developments


	New Products Launched


	MoneyOnMobile signed an agreement with Enfold, a third party vender, and MicroSoft to provide digital lockers for the 170 million individuals in India that constitute MoneyOnMobiles unique user base.


	As part of the Companys philosophy of doing well by doing good, MoneyOnMobile recently launched accident insurance, a new financial services product for our consumers.


	MoneyOnMobile also launched digital gift cards which allows consumers to make purchases online at several eCommerce vendors, including Amazon.in and Flipkart.

	MoneyOnMobile has launched the MOM ATM in selected retail outlets across India to meet the growing demand for digital money and transactions. The MOM ATM allows retail merchants to serve as mini-ATMs. Any Banked customer can withdraw cash from their bank account and any consumer with a prepaid payroll card can withdraw cash from this withdraw their wages at any of our participating retailers. This will make storing money in bank accounts more attractive to people across India because they will be able to access their funds at a time and place that is convenient to them. Currently, there are approximately 207,000 ATMs India
	whose population could support a substantially higher number compared to other countries ATM penetration rates. MOM ATMs are helping to fill this gap in the market.


	India Management Team


	We have recently enhanced our executive management team in India by re-hiring Ranjeet Oak as our President and COO. Mr. Oak is co-founder of MoneyOnMobile and is an accomplished mobile payments executive with broad management skills, including strategic planning, business development and business integration. He has over 20 years of industry experience, having various divisions of IT education, ITES and BPO organizations. Mr. Oak has also energized our product development and marketing efforts through his extensive industry relationships. Additionally, on March 10, 2017, Shashank Joshi, resigned as Director of MoneyOnMobile,
	Inc.


	Reverse Stock Split


	Our board of directors and stockholders approved a 1-for-     reverse split of the Companys outstanding common stock that will become effective upon completing our shareholder vote (the Reverse Stock Split). The Reverse Stock Split will not change the par value of our stock or the number of common shares or preferred shares authorized by our Certificate of Incorporation. Upon shareholder approval, all share and per share amounts in this Registration Statement will be retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.


	New Board Members


	On April 6, 2017, our Board of Directors elected Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Mr. Karl Power as a member of the Board in order to fill the vacant position resulting from the resignation of Shashank Joshi and the Boards resolution to increase the size of the Board to five members.

	RISK FACTORS



	Investing in our common stock and warrants involves significant risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and other information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus. In particular, you should consider the risks related to this offering described below. Our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed as a result of any of these risks. In this event, the market price of our common stock and warrants could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.




	Risks Relating To the Company



	We have incurred significant losses since inception.


	We had an accumulated deficit of $45.7 million as of December 31, 2016. We have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. As such, we are subject to all risks incidental to the sales and development of our product offerings, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Additionally, the Companys unaudited interim financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and audited financial statements as of March 31, 2016 have been prepared on the assumption that the
	Company will continue as a going concern. Our independent accountants have issued in their report stating that our recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.


	Our success will be dependent on local management team for the foreseeable future.


	We believe our success depends on the continued service of local management. Although we currently intend to retain our existing management, we cannot assure such individuals will remain with us. We have no employment agreements with any individuals. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key executives, directors, or advisors, or our inability to find suitable replacements within a reasonable period of time following any such loss, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our business plan and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
	operations.


	We may not be able to raise the additional capital necessary to execute our business strategy which could result in curtailment of our operations.


	Our ability to raise additional capital is uncertain and dependent on numerous factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, economic conditions and availability or lack of availability of credit. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, or if the terms thereof are too costly, we may be forced to curtail operations until such time as alternative financing is arranged that would have a material adverse impact on our planned operations.


	Evolving products and technological changes could make our services obsolete.


	We anticipate the services we offer will continue to evolve and be subject to technological change. Accordingly, our ability to maintain a competitive advantage and build the business requires us to continually invest in research and development. Many of the companies we expect to compete with have greater capital resources, research and development staffs, and facilities. Our services could be rendered obsolete by the introduction and market acceptance of competing services, technological advances by current or potential competitors, or other approaches. Additionally, our processing technology platform will require upgrades to
	meet our business plan, and new problems or delays could develop and limit our ability to grow.


	We anticipate the industry in which we operates will be subject to intense competition.


	There are several direct competitors conducting business in India, and some have access to large markets of existing phone subscribers. Once these companies fully implement their strategies, the competition in India for the services being provided by us may intensify significantly.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	A significant portion of our total assets consists of goodwill, which is subject to a periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.


	We have goodwill totaling $13.5 million at December 31, 2016 resulting from our MoneyOnMobile acquisition. We evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates at least once a year. This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecast, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units. These changes could result in an
	impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.


	We are subject to the risks faced by new businesses.


	MoneyOnMobile is an early-stage company with a limited operating history and lacks profitability in recent periods, and is, therefore, subject to many of the risks and uncertainties faced by new enterprises. There is no assurance we will be able to manage its business effectively, identify, employ, and retain any needed management or technical personnel, further develop and implement its services, obtain third-party contracts or financing, or achieve the other components of its business plan. There is no assurance we will achieve or sustain profitability.


	Political, economic, social, and other factors in India may adversely affect businesses.


	The ability for businesses to grow may be adversely affected by political, economic, and social factors or changes in Indian law or regulations or the status of Indias relations with other countries. In addition, there may be significant differences between the Indian and U.S. economies such as the rate of gross domestic product growth, the rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, and balance of payments positions. Government actions in the future could have a significant effect on the Indian economy and have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve business objectives.


	Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war within India or involving India and other countries could adversely affect the financial markets and businesses.


	Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence could have the direct effect of destroying property causing a loss and interruption of business. For example, India has, from time to time, experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries such as Pakistan. The longstanding dispute with Pakistan over the border Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir remains unresolved. If the Indian government is unable to control the violence and disruption associated with these tensions, the results could destabilize the economy and, consequently, adversely affect businesses. Also, India has seen an increase in politically motivated
	insurgencies and a fairly active communist following. Any hostilities or civil unrest could adversely influence the Indian economy and, as a result, negatively affect businesses.


	Changes in the exchange rate of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar result in earnings volatility and could negatively impact our reported earnings and the ultimate return on our investment.


	MoneyOnMobiles functional currency is the Indian rupee, and its financial statements must be converted to U.S. dollars when preparing our financial statements. Changes in the exchange rate between the two currencies can cause reported financial results to fluctuate and a weakening rupee relative to the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our earnings. Additionally, the return on our investment in DPPL and MMPL, if any, may be less than expected if the exchange rates are less favorable at the time of realization.


	Exchange controls in India may limit our ability to utilize cash flow effectively.


	We are subject to Indias rules and regulations on currency conversion with respect to our investments in DPPL and MMPL. In India, the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulates the conversion of the Indian rupee into foreign currencies. Today, companies in many industries are permitted to operate in India without any special restrictions, effectively placing them on par with wholly, Indian-owned companies. Foreign exchange controls also have been substantially relaxed. However, the Indian foreign exchange market

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	is not yet fully developed, and there is no assurance the Indian authorities will not revert to regulating companies and imposing new restrictions on the convertibility of the Indian rupee. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to repatriate India earnings or receive dividends.


	We may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the U.S. against DPPL and MMPL.


	DPPL and MMPL are organized in India and all of their assets are located in India. As a result, in the event of a dispute between us and either or both of DPPL or MMPL, we may be unable to effect service of process upon either or both of DPPL or MMPL outside of India. In addition, we may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against either or both of DPPL or MMPL.



	Risks Relating to Industry



	The payments industry is highly competitive and we expect to compete with larger firms having greater financial resources. Such competition could increase and adversely influence our prices to merchants and our operating margins.


	We compete in a highly competitive market with a wide variety of processing service providers. Developing and maintaining our growth will depend on a combination of the continued growth in electronic payment transactions and our ability to increase our market share. If competition causes us to reduce the prices we charge, we will have to aggressively control our costs in order to maintain acceptable results of operations.


	Our continued growth depends on our ability to maintain or increase our average net revenue yield


	One of the key measures we use to assess our financial performance is our average net revenue yield, which we calculate by dividing adjusted net revenue by the total payment volume of the transactions we process. Our average net revenue yield may be affected by a number of factors, including increased competition, pressure from merchants and/or agents, and acquisitions. In order to maintain our competitiveness, we must continue to ensure that our payment processing system provides a more convenient and attractive option for both merchants and customers than alternative systems that may not require payment of a processing fee.
	Retail banks and various payment service providers are already and may become available to our consumers. To attract consumers, we also offer certain services on a commission-free basis, such as peer-to-peer transfers and certain payments in e-commerce. Despite our efforts, consumers may still choose to use other payment systems, even if those systems do not offer the convenience that we do, because they charge lower fees. In addition, because agents are able to switch between different payment processing systems, we may face additional pressure to reduce the fees we charge due to increased competition from other payment service providers.


	We are subject to the economic risk and business cycles of our merchants and agents and the overall level of consumer spending.


	The payment services industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. Economic factors such as employment levels, business conditions, energy and fuel costs, interest rates, inflation rate and the strength of the rupee against foreign currencies could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits. If our merchants make fewer
	sales of their products and services using our services or consumers spend less money per transaction, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower amounts, resulting in lower revenue. A further weakening in the economy could have a negative impact on our merchants, as well as consumers who purchase products and services using our payment processing systems, which could, in turn, negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the recessionary environment disproportionately affects some of the market segments that represent a larger portion of our payment processing volume. In addition, these factors could force some of our merchants and/or agents to liquidate their operations or go bankrupt, or could cause our agents to reduce the number of their locations or hours of operation, resulting in reduced transaction volumes. We also have a certain amount of fixed costs, including salaries and rent, which could limit our ability to
	adjust costs and respond quickly to changes affecting the economy and our business.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	We do not control the rates of the fees levied by our agents on consumers.


	Our agents pay us an agreed fee using a portion of the fees levied by them on consumers. The fee paid to us by the agent is based on a percentage of the value of each transaction that we process. However, in certain cases the amount of fees levied by an agent on a consumer for each particular transaction is determined by such agent at its own discretion. We do not cap the amount of such fees or otherwise control it. We believe that the fees set by our agents are market-driven, and that our interests and our agents interests are aligned with a view to maintaining fees at a level that would simultaneously result in our
	agents profitability and customer satisfaction. However, we can provide no assurance that our agents will not raise fees to a level that will adversely affect the popularity of our products among consumers. At the same time, if we are forced to cap customer fees to protect the strength of our brand or otherwise, we may lose a significant number of agents, which would reduce the penetration of our physical distribution network. In limited instances, we have introduced such caps at the request of our merchants. No assurance can be made that this trend will not increase. Material increases in customer fees by our agents or the imposition of caps on the rates of such fees by us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	A decline in the use of cash as a means of payment or a decline in the use of our merchants may result in a reduced demand for our services.


	Substantially all of our business is in India where a substantial part of the population relies on cash payments, rather than credit and debit card payments or electronic banking. We believe that our profitability depends on the use of cash as a means of payment and the reach of our merchant network. There can be no assurance that over time, the prevalence of cash payments will not decline as a greater percentage of the population in emerging markets adopts credit and debit card payments and electronic banking. The shift from cash payments to credit and debit card payments and electronic banking could reduce our market share
	and payment volumes and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	Risks Relating To Acquisitions



	Revenues and profits generated by acquired businesses or account portfolios may be less than anticipated, resulting in losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges.


	In evaluating and determining the purchase price for a prospective acquisition, we estimate the future revenues and profits from that acquisition based on the historical revenue of the acquired provider of payment processing services or portfolio of merchant accounts. Following an acquisition, it is customary to experience some attrition in the number of merchants serviced by an acquired provider of payment processing services or included in an acquired portfolio of merchant accounts. Should the rate of post-acquisition merchant attrition exceed the rate we forecast, the revenues and profits generated by the acquired providers
	of payment processing services or portfolio of accounts may be less than we estimated, which could result in losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges.


	We may fail to uncover all liabilities of acquisition targets through the due diligence process prior to an acquisition, exposing us to potentially significant, unanticipated costs.


	Prior to the consummation of any acquisition, we perform a due diligence review of the business or portfolio of merchant accounts that we propose to acquire. Our due diligence review, however, may not adequately uncover all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the proposed acquisition. For example, in the past we may have been obligated to fund certain credits and charge-backs after discovering that a merchant account from an acquired merchant processing portfolio was in substantial violation of the Visa and MasterCard card association rules. In the future we may make acquisitions that
	may obligate us to make similar payments resulting in potentially significant, unanticipated costs.

	We may not be able to integrate acquired companies or assets or potential future acquisitions into our company, and resources available to assist our acquisitions may be insufficient.


	We have made strategic acquisitions, and we intend to continue to make such acquisitions in accordance with our business plan. Each acquisition involves a number of risks, including:






	1.


	the diversion of our managements attention to the assimilation and ongoing assistance with the operations and personnel of the acquired business, which could strain managements resources;








	2.


	the potential for our affiliated companies to grow rapidly and adversely affect our ability to assist our affiliated companies as intended;








	3.


	possible adverse effects on our results of operations and cash flows;

	6.


	our inability to assist our affiliated companies as intended or to acquire and integrate businesses under our business plan could negatively impact our operations, financial results and cash flows.





	Risks Relating To Government Regulation



	The payments industry in India is subject to extensive regulation.


	Payment system operators like MoneyOnMobile are subject to the Indian Payments and Settlement Systems Act 2007 and operate under the authority and board oversight of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Although the RBI has reviewed the operations, systems, and processes of MoneyOnMobile, and has licensed it to operate a payments system in India through October 24, 2018, the RBI has the authority to revoke this license at any time should MoneyOnMobiles operations not continue to meet standards primarily relating to the custody of, and accountability for, consumer funds. Such revocation would seriously and
	negatively affect the value of MoneyOnMobile. In addition, increased regulatory focus could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the services MoneyOnMobile provides.


	We are subject to federal and state laws regarding anti-money laundering, including the Patriot Act, and if we break any of these laws we could be subject to significant fines and/or penalties, and our ability to conduct business could be limited.


	We are subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which prohibit us from transmitting money to specified countries or on behalf of prohibited individuals. The money transfer business has been subject to increased scrutiny following the events of September 11, 2001. The Patriot Act, enacted following those events, mandates several new anti-money laundering requirements. The federal government or the states may elect to impose additional anti-money laundering requirements. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements,
	including the Patriot Act, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operation.


	Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal and state regulatory authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required registrations, loss of approved status, termination of contracts with banks, administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability. The occurrence of one or more of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	If we were to inadvertently transmit money on behalf of, or unknowingly conduct business with, a prohibited individual, we could be required to pay significant damages, including fines and penalties. Likewise, any intentional or negligent violation of anti-money laundering laws by our employees could lead to significant fines and/or penalties, and could limit our ability to conduct business in some jurisdiction.

	Risks Relating To Our Common Stock



	Changes to current accounting principles and our accounting policies could have a significant effect on the Companys reported financial results or the way in which it conducts its business.


	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and various other authorities formed to interpret, recommend, and announce appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles and/or managements own interpretation and application of such principles could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even retroactively affect the accounting for previously reported transactions. Our accounting
	policies that recently have been, or may in the future, be affected by changes in the following accounting principles:






	


	revenue recognition;








	


	stock-based compensation;








	


	accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets; and








	


	accounting issues related to certain contingent convertible debt instruments and their effect on diluted earnings per share.




	Changes in these or other rules may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business.


	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the value of our common stock.


	Our Certificate of Formation provides for the issuance of up to 1.0 million shares of what is commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock. Such stock may be issued by our Board of Directors from time to time, without shareholder approval, as one or more separate series of shares as designated by resolution of our Board setting forth the relative rights, privileges, and preferences of the series, including, if any, the: (i) dividend rate; (ii) price, terms, and conditions of redemption; (iii) voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences; (iv) provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase; (v)
	terms of conversion to common stock, including conversion price; and (vi) voting rights. The issuance of such shares, with superior rights and preferences, could adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock and potentially the value of our common stock. Our ability to issue such preferred stock also could give our Board of Directors the ability to hinder or discourage any attempt to gain control of us by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest, or otherwise.


	Our executive officers, directors, and major shareholders hold a majority of our common stock and may be able to prevent other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.


	Our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. As a result, acting together they would be able to influence many matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control, and could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and may affect the market price of our stock.


	The price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause our investors to incur trading losses and fail to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them.


	We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of an active trading market in our common stock. The failure to achieve and maintain an active market for our common stock means that you may not be able to dispose of your common stock in a desirable manner and the price for our shares may fluctuate greatly.


	Moreover, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them. If a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our ability to file the

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Companys periodic reports required under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on a timely basis may adversely impact the your ability to trade the Companys shares on the secondary market.


	We incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to comply with public company regulations.


	We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as well as other federal and state laws. These requirements may place a strain on our people, systems, and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting,
	significant resources and management oversight are required. This may divert managements attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



	Risks Related to this Offering



	Investors in this offering will suffer immediate and substantial dilution.


	Because the price per share of our common stock being offered is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock, you will suffer substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase in this offering. If you purchase shares of common stock in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of  $[    ] per share in the net tangible book value of the common stock. See the section entitled Dilution below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you purchase common stock in this
	offering.


	We will have considerable discretion over the use of the proceeds of this offering and may not realize an adequate return.


	We will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds that we will apply to various corporate purposes. We may use the proceeds for purposes that do not yield a significant return, if any, for our stockholders.


	Future sales or issuances of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock and warrants to decline.


	The sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether directly by us or in the secondary market by existing security holders (including holders of our outstanding warrants and convertible debt), the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and warrants and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities. Any such sales may result in significant dilution to
	our existing shareholders, including you. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders, which will result in additional dilution to you.


	Warrants are speculative due to their structure and the value of our common stock may never exceed the exercise price of the warrants.


	The warrants do not confer any rights of common stock ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends. Rather, the warrants merely represent the right to acquire shares of our common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time. Specifically, commencing on the date of issuance, holders of the warrants may exercise their right to acquire the common stock and pay an exercise price of $[    ] per share (125% of public offering price of the common stock), prior to five years from the date of issuance, after which date any unexercised warrants will expire and have no
	further value. Moreover, following this offering, the market value of the warrants is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the market value of the warrants will equal or exceed their public offering price. There can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for holders of the warrants to exercise the warrants.

	The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives requires the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed
	on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements included in this prospectus are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.


	We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included or incorporated by reference important factors in the cautionary statements included in this prospectus, particularly in the Risk Factors section, that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make.

	or to any document incorporated by reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. It is routine for internal projections and expectations to change as the year, or each quarter in the year, progresses, and, therefore, it should be clearly understood that the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our expectations are made as of the date of this prospectus and may change prior to the end of each quarter or the year.






	USE OF PROCEEDS


	We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deduction of the underwriting discount and payment of estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $     (or approximately $     if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full).


	We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for operating costs, retirement of those note obligations which will have an early maturity date upon the successful closing of this offering, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or acquire businesses or technologies that we believe are complementary to our own, although we have no current plans, commitments, or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date of this prospectus.


	The expected use of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions, our future revenues and expenditures. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including market conditions, cash generated by our operations, business developments and related rate of growth. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes.


	From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities such as money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

	DIVIDEND POLICY


	We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. Our board of directors sets our dividend policy. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, but we may determine in the future to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors ad will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and
	other factors that our board of directors considers relevant.







	DILUTION


	If you invest in our common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share and the pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering. We calculate net tangible book value per share by dividing the net tangible book value, which is tangible assets less total liabilities, by the number of outstanding shares of our common stock.


	Our net tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $7.5 million, or $0.13 per share. After giving effect to the sale by us of      shares of common stock offered by this prospectus at a public offering price of $     per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2016 would have been approximately $    , or $     per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of
	$     per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $     per share to new investors purchasing our common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates the per share dilution:

	The information above assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, our net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering would be $     per share, and the dilution in net tangible book value per share to investors in this offering would be $     per share.


	The above discussion and table are based on 58,612,098 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and does not include, as of that date:


	16,863,242 shares underlying outstanding warrants;

	Approximately $2,900,000 outstanding principal amount and interest of convertible debt which can be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price that varies depending on the average trading price of shares of our common stock.


	If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, the pro forma net tangible book value after this offering would be $     per share, representing an increase in net tangible book value of $     per share to existing stockholders and immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $     per share to purchasers in this offering at the public offering price.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

	FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	MoneyOnMobile, Inc. is one of Indias largest mobile payments technology and processing companies offering digital payment services to cash using businesses and consumers. The company covers all of India with a single source solution reaching the cash using population of businesses and consumers. MoneyOnMobile services enable Indian businesses and consumers to use their mobile phones to pay for goods and services or transfer funds from one cell phone to another using simple SMS text functionality instead of cash.


	MoneyOnMobile allows consumers to deposit funds into their mobile wallet or to perform a financial transaction through its robust agent network of over 330,000 retail locations as of December 31, 2016. Consumers use their mobile phones to make certain routine payments for utilities or to transfer currency to other consumers using text-messaging and mobile application technology. Customer contracts, and the license to operate, have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India and are the property of My Mobile Payments Limited (MMPL), which maintains custody of customers funds in accordance with Indias regulations.
	Another MoneyOnMobile company, Digital Payments Processing Limited (DPPL), owns and operates the retail agent network, the customer support call center, the sales support functions, and the intellectual property necessary to process transactions.


	MoneyOnMobile representatives Messrs. Montgomery and Arey are two of the four members of DPPLs board of directors. Mr. Montgomery is Chairman of the DPPL board with a tie-breaking vote. Mr. Montgomery also is one of 6 members of MMPLs board.


	MoneyOnMobile, Inc., a Texas corporation headquartered in Dallas, Texas, was incorporated on May 30, 2006, as Toyzap.com, Inc., and became a public company on May 7, 2008, through a self-underwritten registered public offering of 4,000,000 shares of $.001 par value common stock. The offering raised $150,000 that was used to pursue a business strategy that never commenced operations. The shell company, Toyzap.com, Inc., was acquired by members of the Companys current management team, affiliates thereof, and certain other purchasers, on April 23, 2010, pursuant to purchase agreements whereby approximately 99% of
	the Companys then issued and outstanding common stock was acquired. At such time, the former management and Board of Directors resigned and a new management team and Board of Directors were appointed, who then redirected the business focus of the Company to the business plan described below. On September 3, 2010, the Company changed its name to Calpian, Inc. pursuant to approval obtained at a meeting of our shareholders. On August 9, 2016, the Company changed its name to MoneyOnMobile, Inc. pursuant to approval obtained at a meeting of our shareholders. The Companys common stock began trading in the over the counter (OTC) market on March 4, 2009.


	In March 2013, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Calpian Commerce, Inc. (Calpian Commerce), to own and operate certain assets and liabilities of Pipeline Data, Inc. and its subsidiaries acquired in exchange for a cash payment of $9.75 million. The acquisition was financed by expanding the Companys senior credit facility from $5 million to $14.5 million.


	Effective November 30, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with eVance Processing Inc. (eVance) to divest its Calpian Commerce business segment and certain other U.S. residual portfolio assets of the Company including its partially-owned joint venture Calpian Residual Acquisition, LLC, and its equity investment in Calpian Granite Hill, L.P. This action was undertaken to allow the Company to focus entirely on executing its growth strategy for MoneyOnMobile. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.


	In March 2012, the Company began to invest in a Mumbai, India-based mobile money system catering to Indias vast unbanked and under-banked populations with transaction services. It allows consumers to deposit cash with one of our agents at a retail location in order to perform any one of a variety of financial transactions. The Companys investment was achieved by acquiring equity interests in Digital Payments Processing Limited (DPPL), a newly-organized company. DPPL maintains an exclusive services agreement with My Mobile Payments Limited (MMPL). Additionally, Payblox Technologies (India)
	Private Limited (Payblox), a wholly owned subsidiary of MMPL, organized in October 2010 under the laws of India and headquartered in Mumbai, India, provides certain back office and support services on behalf of MMPL to its

	customer base. These companies are all organized under the laws of India and headquartered in Mumbai, India. MoneyOnMobile is the primary beneficiary of MMPL.


	On March 31, 2015, My Mobile Payments Limited executed a business transfer agreement to sell its business to DPPL. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has acquired 69.56% and 8.17% of the outstanding common stock of DPPL and MMPL, respectively. The Company and MMPL have entered into an agreement by which the Company intends to acquire additional shares of common stock of MMPL to increase its equity percentage to 74% for an additional investment amount to be negotiated as future investments are made. The acquisition of additional shares is subject to approval by the Indian government and regulations for foreign investment.



	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	The following analysis of the results of operations for the (i) three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015; and, (ii) fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
	because of a number of factors. An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Readers of this prospectus should carefully consider the risks set forth in the Risk Factors section of this prospectus. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, or similar expressions, variations of those terms or the negative of those terms to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements specified in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements.

	Revenues and Cost of Revenues


	Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 were lower than in 2015 by $(0.6) million or (39.8)% as the Company was negatively impacted by demonetization. Demonetization began on November 8, 2016, when the India government announced that about 86% of Indias currency, consisting of 500 and 2,000 rupee notes, were no longer be accepted as legal tender. A 50 day grace period was provided to exchange these voided notes with new 500 and 2,000 notes. The effect of this was that cash was scarce making it difficult for people to pay for any of our goods or services. In addition to this, the long queues at banks made it
	difficult for our distribution network to make cash deposits to support their transactional business with us. Beginning in early December 2016 our processing volume and number of transactions began to improve mainly due to the establishment of our new line of credit in India. Additionally, the high capital requirements for domestic remittances continues to limit our ability to sell additional services.


	We continue to focus our working capital on higher margin goods and services which continues to improve of our gross margins. Gross profit percentage was 59.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 55.4% in 2015. In addition to changes in service mix during the quarter, our program to control operating costs continues.

	Interest expense totaled $1,257,229 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2,026,141 for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the decrease of our average borrowings outstanding. Interest expense resulted from the accretion to face value of borrowings advanced to our Company as well as accruing interest on all debt outstanding.

	Revenues and Cost of Revenues


	Revenues in 2016 were higher than in 2015 by $0.5 million or 9.0% due to increases in monthly customer base and higher volume of usage by existing consumers. Gross profit percentage was 46.1% in 2016 compared to 39.1% in 2015. General and administrative costs increased by $5.1 million or 41.2% compared to 2015 due primarily to direct commissions and other fees paid associated with capital raising to fund the growth strategies.


	Additionally, the Company incurred interest and financing costs of $3.0 million and $1.3 million in 2016 and 2015. Net losses attributable to MoneyOnMobile, Inc. shareholders were approximately $(16.0) million, or $(0.34) per share in 2016 compared to $(8.8) million, or $(0.22) per share in 2015. Due to net losses, the Company had no current U.S. federal tax provision in either 2016 or 2015 and deferred tax benefits of cumulative net operating losses and other temporary tax differences have been offset by valuation allowances. State income tax reports are assessments not offset by operating losses.


	Advertising and Promotion


	Advertising and promotion totaled $758,742 for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1,210,541 during the same period in 2015, resulting in a $451,799 decrease from 2015 to 2016. The majority of the decrease was related to reduce marketing campaigns in current year.


	Personnel


	Salaries and wages expenses totaled $3,332,645 for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $3,822,589 during the same prior year period. The decrease of $489,944 and 13% was primarily due to lower executive compensation costs in 2016.


	Selling, General and Administrative


	Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $13,282,909 for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $7,924,233 for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase of $5,358,676 and 68% was primarily related to increases of $2,769,639 for deferred consulting fee amortization and $4,470,402 for equity awards issued for services.

	Professional Fees


	Professional fees totaled $1,294,748 for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1,427,983 for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease of $133,235 was primarily attributable to lower audit and legal costs in 2016.


	Other Income (Expenses)


	Interest expense totaled $3,047,358 for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1,337,243 for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the decrease of our average borrowings outstanding. Interest expense resulted from the accretion to face value of borrowings advanced to our Company as well as accruing interest on all debt outstanding.




	Liquidity and Capital Resources.


	Our source of liquidity is principally cash generated from operating activities supplemented as necessary on a short-term basis by various capital raising activities, including sales of our common stock in private placements and subordinated debt borrowings not restricted to specific investing activities. We continue to see significant growth potential in our MoneyOnMobile business segment and have increased our investment. To date we have successfully navigated the complexities of capital raising activities in order to fund these long-term investments. The following discussion highlights changes in our debt structure as well
	as our cash flow activities and the sources and uses of funds during the nine months ended December 31, 2016.


	Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 do not contain any adjustments for this uncertainty. In response to our cash needs, we raised the following funding as described below. Any additional amounts raised will be used for our future investing and operating cash flow needs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional amounts of financing.



	Recent Financing Activities

	:


	In December 2016, MMPL entered into a Loan Agreement with YES BANK Limited (the Lender), pursuant to which the Lender extended an unsecured credit facility to the Company totaling approximately $1,500,000 (Credit Facility). As part of the agreement, a MoneyOnMobile, Inc. shareholder provided the lender with a $2,000,000 standby letter-of-credit in order to assure repayment by MMPL of any amounts borrowed from the Lender. The aggregate interest rate on the Credit Facility totals 11.6% and matures in December 2017.


	As of December 31, 2016, our liquidity was $1.4 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents. Our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, debt service and fund growth opportunities in India. The company faces large debt repayments in the near-term and is contemplating numerous strategies to meet these obligations as they come due.


	In December 2016, the Company began a new round of financing through an exempt offering of equity securities for a total of $10,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $650,000 had been received by the Company. From January 1 through March 5, 2017, the Company issued 1,513,334 common shares along with 306,269 warrants for $918,800.



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.



	Inflation



	Inflation and changing prices have had no material effect on our net sales and revenues or on our income from continuing operations over our two most recent fiscal years.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	Our managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the fair market value of our assets and accrued stock-based compensation
	expense. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends, and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.


	For a description of our critical accounting policies, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. There have not been any material changes to our critical accounting policies since March 31, 2016.

	OVERVIEW



	MoneyOnMobile is a mobile phone based payment processing network catering to Indias vast unbanked and under-banked population, providing everyday financial transactional services. MoneyOnMobile allows consumers to deposit cash with one of our agents. The consumers cash deposit then becomes digital currency in our computerized records similar to as if the consumer had made a deposit at the bank. Afterward the consumer, or the agent acting on behalf of the consumer, can perform financial transactions such as bill payment or money transfer using only the mobile phone and SMS text messages.


	The Indian market is the largest under-banked population in the world with approximately 600 million to 800 million individuals. The MoneyOnMobile system works with any mobile phone handset that can generate a SMS text message. It does not require a smart phone, which represent only approximately 15% of all handsets in India. The MoneyOnMobile system is more reliable, cheaper and much easier than transacting in all cash.


	Weve now grown to be one of Indias largest mobile money systems. As of December 31, 2016, we have over 330,000 participating agents where consumers can load cash, operating in 700 cities across India. Consumers have the ability to perform over 55 different transaction types including various bill payments and domestic remittances, which is sending money from one person to another anywhere in the country. To-date, weve served over 193 million cumulative mobile phone numbers and weve processed almost U.S.$1.7 billion worth of transactions.



	STRATEGY



	Our strategy is to be the last mile payment processor of choice across India, working with financial institutions, third-party agents and other service providers to make consumers lives easier by not having to wait hours in line to perform basic payment functions. One of our core operating metrics is processing volume, the amount of value that is processed over our network. We grow our processing volume by increasing the number of services offered on our network, by increasing the number of agents enabled with our service, and by increasing the inventory turn of cash through our network.


	We are working with a number of banks and payment processors to increase our agent service offerings, and will continue to expand our number of partners in order to provide more value to consumers daily lives. Our agent growth is directly attributable from our organic sales efforts through our sales team; at the same time, we also grow our number of agents by sign up existing organizations or cooperatives to our service. The velocity of money within our network increases through two key factors: increasing the number of deposits collected from our agents on a daily basis, and by our agents offering a diverse and
	profitable mix of cash-in and cash-out services.



	OUR PRODUCTS



	Our core products can be broken down into two primary categories: cash-in transactions and cash-out transactions. Within the cash-in product category, we perform cash collection services for a wide range of companies including mobile operators, satellite TV providers, utility companies, e-commerce companies, insurance companies and banks. In addition to these services, we originate domestic remittance transactions, which is the sending of money from one consumer within India to another consumer. Within the cash-out product category, we enable consumers to withdraw cash from their bank accounts. We also allow consumers to access
	their bank account balance for making purchases at any MoneyOnMobile retail shop.





	COMPETITION



	MoneyOnMobile experiences and will experience intense competition from companies developing digital payment and eWallet technologies. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources.


	PayTM, MobiKwik, and FreeCharge, are only payment mechanisms. They only allow you to buy something at a store using a protocol like an app on Apple Pay. MoneyOnMobile is really fundamentally quite different for a couple of reasons. One is were a business opportunity for our agents, they make money on MoneyOnMobile. They dont make money processing transactions for our competitors.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Second, our cost of processing the marginal transaction is extremely low, very, very low in fact and we can therefore handle very small transactions. PayTM and the others load value into their digital wallet using traditional credit or debit cards, requiring the consumer to have a bank account so their marginal transaction cost is a lot higher.



	GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION



	The industry in which we operate is subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations in the United States and India. There are numerous laws and regulations restricting the purchase, sale, and sharing of personal information about consumers, many of which are new and continue to evolve; accordingly, it is difficult to determine whether and how existing and proposed privacy laws may apply to our businesses in the future. Also, there are numerous consumer statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, regarding the possession of both consumer- and merchant-level data with which we must comply. Furthermore,
	government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in increased regulation of our product(s), resulting in a greater regulatory burden for us.


	Payment system operators in India are subject to the Indian Payments and Settlement Systems Act 2007 and operate under the authority and board oversight of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In the licensing process, the RBI reviews the licensees operations, systems, and processes and has the authority to revoke a license at any time should operations not continue to meet RBI standards, primarily those relating to the custody of, and accountability for, consumer funds.





	EMPLOYEES



	As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed five employees at its executive offices located in Dallas, Texas. During the year, we utilized independent consultants to assist with certain accounting, financial reporting, and administrative matters. DPPL and MMPL combined employed approximately 300 hundred full and part-time employees. The Company and our affiliates have no employment or collective bargaining agreements and we believe our employee and independent contractor relationships are satisfactory.






	DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY



	Our corporate offices are currently located at 500 N. Akard Street, Suite 2850, Dallas, Texas 75201. Our India headquarters are located at the MoM House located at 61 Ramchandra Lane, Kanchpada, Mumbai, India 400064.






	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	Hall MOM, LLC v. MoneyOnMobile, Inc.


	On March 1, 2017, Hall MOM, LLC (Hall MOM) and MoneyOnMobile, Inc. reached an agreed final judgment upon execution of a settlement agreement and release (Hall Settlement Agreement). As part of the Hall Settlement Agreement, MoneyOnMobile, Inc. shall pay Hall MOM $3,000,000, plus interest and attorneys fees. $1,000,000 of this amount is payable in two $500,000 installments on or before March 15, 2017 and March 31, 2017. The remaining $2,000,000 is part of an executed promissory note due from MoneyOnMobile, Inc. to Hall MOM (Hall MOM Note). The Hall MOM Note is payable beginning April 3,
	2017 through December 31, 2017 in monthly minimum payments of $50,000. Interest accrues on the Hall MOM Note at 10% per annum on outstanding balance through June 30, 2017 and 15% per annum afterward. Upon full payment by MoneyOnMobile, Inc. to Hall MOM, Hall MOM will surrender its 450,379 shares owned of DPPL to MoneyOnMobile, Inc., which shares represent 8.2% of DPPL at December 31, 2016.

	Because our common stock currently is not traded on any national securities exchange or other major trading system, we are not subject to any standards regarding the independence of our directors. However, if our listing application is approved by the NASDAQ Capital Market, we will be required to have a majority independent directors on our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors believes that James M. McKelvey, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Karl Power are independent as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.


	Committees of the Board of Directors


	Pursuant to our Bylaws, our Board of Directors may establish committees of one or more directors from time-to-time as it deems appropriate. The Company has no separate committees and all matters of corporate governance are addressed by the full Board of Directors. In matters involving our directors and their separate interests, only disinterested directors vote.


	We have neither a separate audit committee nor an audit committee financial expert as defined by applicable SEC rules. The Board may consider the establishment of a separate audit committee and, if established, the Board believes that Karl Power may serve on the committee and as the Boards audit committee financial expert.


	The Board intends to establish the committees necessary to comply with NASDAQ rules prior to our application for listing being accepted.

Each share of common stock entitles a stockholder to one vote on all matters upon which stockholders are permitted to vote. Common stock does not confer on the holder any preemptive right or other similar right to purchase or subscribe for any additional securities issued by us and is not convertible into other securities. No shares of common stock are subject to redemption or any sinking fund provisions. All the outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Subject to the rights of the holders of the preferred
	stock, the holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to dividends out of funds legally available when and as declared by our Board of Directors. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive, ratably, the net assets available to stockholders after payment of all creditors and any liquidation preference on outstanding preferred stock.


	As of December 31, 2016 we had 58,612,098 shares of common stock, 1,225 shares of Preferred Series D stock and 2,530 shares of Preferred Series E stock outstanding,

In
	no event shall we be required to make any cash payments or net cash settlement to the registered holder in lieu of issuance of common stock underlying the warrants.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Texas Law and Our Certificate of Formation.


	Some provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code, or the TBOC, our certificate of formation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult: acquisitions of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our directors. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a
	premium over the market price for our shares. In addition, because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines, it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences, rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock.


	These provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.


	Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors.


	The TBOC, authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties, subject to certain exceptions. Our certificate of formation and bylaws include provisions that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent permitted under the TBOC. The effect of these provisions eliminate the rights of us and our shareholders, through shareholders derivative suits on our behalf, to recover monetary damages from a
	director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation will not apply to any director if the director has acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived an improper benefit from his or her actions as a director.


	Our bylaws provide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the TBOC. We also carry directors and officers liability insurance providing indemnification for our directors, officers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification and advancement provisions and insurance will be useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers.


	The limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement provisions in our certificate of formation and bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.


	There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.


	Authorized but Unissued Shares


	Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without shareholder approval. We may use additional shares for a variety of purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, to fund acquisitions and as employee compensation. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.




	Transfer Agent and Registrar


	The registrar and transfer agent for our common stock is Securities Transfer Corporation.

	The underwriters are committed to purchase all the shares of common stock and warrants offered by us if they purchase any shares of common stock and warrants. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the offering may be terminated. The underwriters are not obligated to purchase the shares of common stock and/or warrants covered by the underwriters over-allotment option described below. The underwriters are offering the shares of common stock and warrants, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and
	accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, and other conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriters of officers certificates and legal opinions. The underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.


	Discounts and Commissions


	The underwriters propose initially to offer the shares of common stock and warrants to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to dealers at those prices less a concession not in excess of $[    ] per share of common stock and concession not in excess of $[    ] per warrant. If all of the shares of common stock and warrants offered by us are not sold at the public offering price, the underwriters may change the offering price and other selling terms by means of a supplement to this prospectus.


	The following table shows the public offering price, underwriting discounts and commissions and proceeds before expenses to us. The information assumes either no exercise or full exercise of the over-allotment option we granted to the representatives of the underwriters:

	We have agreed to pay a non-accountable expense allowance to the representative of the underwriters equal to 1% of the gross proceeds received at the closing of the offering. We have paid an expense deposit of $25,000 to the representative, which will be applied against the out-of-pocket accountable expenses that will be paid by us to the underwriters in connection with this offering, and will be reimbursed to us to the extent not actually incurred in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(C).


	We have also agreed to pay the representatives expenses relating to the offering, including (a) all actual filing fees incurred in connection with the review of this offering by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA; (b) all fees, expenses and disbursements relating to background checks of our officers and directors in an amount not to exceed $15,000 in the aggregate; (c) the costs associated with bound volumes of the public offering materials as well as commemorative mementos and lucite tombstones, each of which the Company or its designee will provide within a reasonable time after the closing in such
	quantities as Joseph Gunnar & Co. may reasonably request; (d) the fees and expenses of the Underwriters legal counsel not to exceed $75,000;

	We estimate the expenses of this offering payable by us, not including underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $    .


	Over-Allotment Option


	We have granted a 45-day option to the representative of the underwriters to purchase up to      additional shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $     per share and/or warrants to purchase      shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $     per warrant, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.


	The underwriters may exercise this option for 45 days from the date of this prospectus solely to cover sales of shares of common stock and/or warrants by the underwriters in excess of the total number of shares of common stock and/or warrants set forth in the table above. If any of these additional shares and/or warrants are purchased, the underwriters will offer the additional shares and/or warrants on the same terms as those on which the shares and warrants are being offered. We will pay the expenses associated with the exercise of the over-allotment option.


	Representative Warrants


	We have agreed to issue to the representative the representatives warrants to purchase up to      shares of common stock (5% of the shares of common stock and shares of common stock underlying warrants sold in this offering, plus 5% of any shares of common stock and/or warrants sold upon exercise of the over-allotment option, if any). The representatives warrants will be exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four-year period commencing one year from the effective date of the registration statement at a per share exercise price equal to 125% of the public
	offering price per share of common stock in the offering. The representatives warrants and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are, therefore, subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA. The representatives (or permitted assignees under the Rule) will not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate these warrants or the securities underlying these warrants, nor will it engage in any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of these warrants or the underlying securities for a period of 180 days after the effective date. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrant exercise price or
	underlying shares will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below the warrant exercise price.


	Right of First Refusal


	Until twelve (12) months from the closing of the Offering, provided that the Offering results in gross proceeds of $5 million to the Company, the representative shall have an irrevocable right of first refusal to act as sole investment banker, sole book-runner and/or sole placement agent, at the representative sole discretion, for each and every future public and private equity and debt offerings for the Company, or any successor to or any subsidiary of the Company, including all equity linked financings, on terms customary to the representative. The representative shall have the sole right to determine whether or not any other
	broker-dealer shall have the right to participate in any such offering and the economic terms of any such participation. The representative will not have more than one opportunity to waive or terminate the right of first refusal in consideration of any payment or fee.


	Lock-Up Agreements


	Pursuant to lock-up agreements, we, our executive officers and directors, and certain of our stockholders, have agreed, without the prior written consent of the representative not to directly or indirectly, offer to sell, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of shares of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the transfer or disposition by any person at any time in the future of) our common stock, enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of
	ownership of shares of our common stock, make

	Indemnification of Underwriters


	We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make for these liabilities.


	Stabilization


	In order to facilitate the offering of our securities, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our securities. In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our securities in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of securities than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covered short sales are sales made in an amount not
	greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shares of securities in the offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing shares of securities in the open market. In determining the source of shares of securities to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. Naked short sales are sales in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing securities in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our securities in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
	Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of shares of securities made by the underwriters in the open market before the completion of the offering.


	Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our securities or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our securities. As result, the price of our securities may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.


	The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M under the Exchange Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our securities, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the representative of the underwriters purchases securities in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representative can require the underwriters that sold those shares as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them.


	The underwriters make no representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our securities. In addition, neither we nor the underwriters make any representation that the underwriters will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.


	Electronic Offer, Sale and Distribution of Shares


	A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the websites maintained by one or more underwriters or selling group members, if any, participating in the offering. The underwriters may agree to allocate a number of shares of securities to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representative to underwriters and selling group members that may make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on the underwriters websites and any
	information contained in any other website maintained by the underwriters is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.

	1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A description of our accounting policies and other financial information is included in our audited consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. The disclosures included in our accompanying interim financial statements and footnotes should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
	notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.


	Disposition of Assets


	On November 30, 2015, the Company consummated the sale of Calpian Commerce, Inc. and certain other U.S. portfolio assets. As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods presented and the (loss) gain on disposal have been included in Net (loss) income from discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See note 14  

	Sale of U.S. Operations

	for additional information.


	Going Concern


	The Companys unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $(2,949,874) and $(7,989,461) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.


	The Company is continuing with its plan to further grow and expand its mobile payment processing operations in India. Management believes that its current operating strategy will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern as long as it continues to obtain additional financing; however, there is no assurance this will occur. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	Reclassifications


	Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.


	2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	Fair Value Measurements


	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Carrying values of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and interest payable approximate fair values. Additionally, carrying value of senior notes, subordinated notes, and note payable approximate the estimated fair value for debt with similar terms, interest rates, and remaining maturities currently available to companies with similar credit ratings.


	The estimated fair value of our common stock issued in share-based payments is measured by the more relevant of: (i) the prices received in private placement sales of our stock or; (ii) its publicly-quoted market price. We estimate the fair value of warrants, other than those included in common stock unit purchases, and stock options when issued or vested using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Recognition in shareholders equity and expense of the fair value of stock options awarded to employees is on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period
	and, for grants to non-employees, when the options vest. The fair value of exercisable warrants on the date of issuance issued in connection with debt financing transactions or for services are deferred and expensed over the term of the debt or as services are performed.

	2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)


	Convertible Instruments


	Certain debt instrument require us to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. This criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
	changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the debt term.


	Derivative Financial Instruments


	We classify as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares providing that such contracts are indexed to the Companys common stock. We classify as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Companys control) or (ii) gives the counter party a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We assesses
	classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.


	Our free standing derivatives consist of embedded conversion options with a convertible note. The Company evaluated these derivatives to assess their proper classification in the condensed consolidated balance sheets using the applicable classification criteria enumerated under ASC 815-Derivatives and Hedging. We determined certain embedded conversion features do not contain fixed settlement provisions. As a result, we were required to record the conversion option associated with the debt as an embedded derivative. We previously recorded this liability as a derivative liability within current liabilities in our historical
	consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the value of this derivative liability has been marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period and recorded as Other income (expense) in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31 and March 31, 2016 we did not have any outstanding convertible instruments that would be classified as a derivative.


	Foreign Currency Translation


	The functional currency of our Indian operations is the Indian Rupee. Indian assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each consolidated balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at quarterly average exchange rates and resulting translation gains or losses are accumulated in other comprehensive loss as a separate component within the accompanying statements of shareholders equity. Additionally, cumulative translation adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to noncontrolling interest proportionally based on the weighted average
	percentage ownership interest held by the noncontrolling interest.


	Goodwill


	Goodwill consists of the cost of our acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is allocated to reporting units based on the relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit.


	We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. We have elected to first assess the

	qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that
	it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.


	Intangible Assets


	Intangible assets consist of software (excluding computer software), customer lists, trademarks, distributor contracts and domain names acquired through business combinations, or consists of software developed or obtained for internal use, as well as software intended for resale. Costs to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized on a per project basis and are amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life.


	Costs for software developed for resale are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established, capitalized once technological feasibility occurs, including costs for coding and testing, and expensed once the software is available for release to customers. Capitalized costs for software available for sale are amortized over the greater of the amounts computed for the (1) expected revenue to total anticipated revenue or (2) straight line basis over its estimated useful life.


	The amortization period is five years for customer lists, acquisition costs and trademarks, five years for internal use software, three years for software developed for resale and domain names are not amortized. Capitalized finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but reviewed at least annually for potential impairment.


	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets


	In addition to the annual goodwill impairment test, long-lived assets, including property and equipment and other intangible assets, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life
	assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life. There were no adjustments to the carrying value or useful lives of long-lived assets (other than goodwill) during the three or nine months ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.


	Revenue Recognition


	The Company recognizes revenue when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been performed; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.

	2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)


	The following revenue recognition policies define the manner in which the Company recognizes its sales transactions:


	Money transfer represents our instant domestic remittance service in India. Once a consumer has established a MoneyOnMobile electronic wallet account, they have the capability to facilitate non-distributor-related transactions with other parties that have MoneyOnMobile accounts, including other retailers, utilities and other consumers. The Company records revenue, representing a variable transaction fee, upon completion of a money transfer transaction. Distributors often keep a prepaid balance with MoneyOnMobile to facilitate MoneyOnMobile transactions. Prepaid balances are deferred until utility units are delivered to the end
	consumer.


	Bill payment transactions provide consumers the ability to pay utility bills by mobile phone text message and smart phone through the Companys distribution network. This process is facilitated through the Companys electronic wallet technology. The Company earns a fixed transaction fee from the consumers service provider for our payment facilitation services. The Company records revenue upon confirmation of a customer transaction on a net basis, which represents the commission earned by the Company from the service provider.


	Recharges are comprised of mobile phone and direct-to-home (DTH) top ups made by consumers. The Company purchases utility units from various vendors for resale through our network of distributors. Revenue is recognized on delivery of the utility units to the end consumer on a net basis, as the Company is acting in an agent capacity. The Company does not change the product or perform part of the service, has minimal discretion in supplier selection, has minimal latitude in establishing prices and possesses no credit risk.


	Ticketing and other revenue represents the sale of train tickets, airline tickets, hotel bookings and online purchases made by consumers through third party partner websites. Revenue is recorded at time of consumer purchase on a net basis, which represents the commission earned by the Company from the service provider.


	As of December 31 and March 31, 2016 advances from distributors was $2,285,918 and $4,013,509, respectively.


	Commitments and Contingencies


	In the normal course of business, there are various claims in process, matters in litigation, and other contingencies. Currently, there are no claims that had a material effect on the Company. See note 13  

	Commitment and Contingencies

	for additional details.


	Recent Accounting Pronouncements


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. On July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.


	In February 2016, the FASB issued its final lease accounting standard, FASB Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases, which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the effect that ASC 842 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard is to be applied under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.

	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which has simplified the test for goodwill impairment. This ASU eliminated step two of the goodwill impairment test. The effective date for the company is April 1, 2020. However, we intend to early adopt for our annual goodwill impairment test performed in our upcoming fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The effect that ASU 2017-04 will reduce the complexity of the goodwill impairment test.


	There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted or recently issued pronouncements that we expect to have a material effect on the presentation or disclosure of our future consolidated operating results, cash flows or financial condition.

	Subordinated Notes Payable


	The Companys subordinated debt has been issued pursuant to a $3 million Subordinated Debt Offering and a separate $2 million Subordinated Debt Offering. Each offering is exempt from registration under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as described in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 6, 2011 and August 10, 2012. The notes are secured by a first lien on substantially all of the Companys assets, but are subordinated to the senior credit facility. The notes bear interest at a rate of 12% annually paid monthly in arrears.


	On December 30, 2014, the Company amended the subordinated notes payable to extend the maturity to December 31, 2016. In consideration for the maturity extension, the notes were amended to add a conversion feature, which gives the note holder the option to convert the notes at a price equal to $1.00 per share of common stock. Furthermore, the Company has the option, upon three day prior written notice, to require the note holders to convert the outstanding principal of the note into common stock if the share price equals or exceeds $2.00 in any ninety (90) day trading period.


	Additionally, the Company granted the note holders a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock for every $1,000,000 of outstanding principal at the time of the amendment. The 960,000 warrants had a fair value at issuance of $442,400 using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The modification date discount value is amortized over the remaining term of the modified debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 16.75%. For the three month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, amortized debt discount included in interest expense totaled $226,911 and $57,048, respectively. For the nine month periods ended December 31,
	2016 and 2015, amortized debt discount included in interest expense totaled $575,071 and $171,144, respectively. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company made principal payments of $0 and $0.


	In March 2016, the Company extended the maturity date on its remaining subordinated debt from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. As part of this agreement, the Company issued to debt holders 3,200,000 warrants, which possessed an aggregate fair value of $1,267,817 at issuance using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 1,000,000 of these warrants were subsequently canceled prior to year-end and reissued with an extended maturity date.


	In July 2016, the Company negotiated with certain investors to covert $300,000 of subordinated notes payable and $49,350 of interest payable into 499,072 shares of the Companys common stock.

	Notes Payable and Promissory Notes


	In October 2015, the Company received $6,000,000 from various investors as part of a debt subscription agreement, which was specific to facilitating the sale of the Companys U.S. Operations. As part of the November 2015 sale, the entire debt was assumed by the purchaser of the U.S. Operations. Additionally, short term notes totaling $59,434 were issued to the note holders to account for the interest that was incurred by the Company while the funds were in escrow and have a maturity date of December 31, 2016.


	In April 2016, and as part of the Companys settlement agreement with the buyer of its U.S. Operations, the Company issued two new promissory notes, First, $727,285, of which $720,084 was the note balance included in the Asset Purchase Agreement, with the remaining balance as subsequent interest incurred. This note possessed an interest rate of 12% per annum payable monthly, matures on December 31, 2017. Second, the Company issued the buyer a $675,000 note in exchange for the buyer waiving any claims for breach of the Purchase Agreement between the buyer and the Company. Additionally, the Company escrowed 2,000,000 shares
	of its common stock as a guarantee of repayment for the $675,000 note. The Company issued three notes totaling $546,440, which represented the remaining outstanding debt of a Company subsidiary that was not included as part of the sale of U.S. Operations at March 31, 2016. These loans have a maturity date of December 31, 2016.


	In December 2016, the Company extended the maturity date on $622,679 of its notes payable and promissory notes from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. No other terms of the debt agreements were changed. As part of this debt modification, the Company issued to note holders 59,709 warrants, which possessed an aggregate fair value of $32,365 at issuance using the Black-Scholes valuation model.


	India Office Building Mortgage


	During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, MMPL refinanced its office building loan by paying off its loan with the Union Bank of India, and replacing it with a $2,198,000 loan with Standard Chartered. The new loan is at a variable interest of 11.10% per annum with principal and interest payments to be made in 180 equal monthly payments and is collateralized by the building.


	India Line of Credit


	In December 2016, MMPL entered into a Loan Agreement with YES BANK Limited (the Lender), pursuant to which the Lender extended an unsecured credit facility to the Company totaling approximately $1,500,000 (Credit Facility). As part of the agreement, a MoneyOnMobile, Inc. shareholder provided the lender with a $2,000,000 standby letter-of-credit in order to assure repayment by MMPL of any amounts borrowed from the Lender. The aggregate interest rate on the Credit Facility totals 11.6% and matures in December 2017.






	9  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


	We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity
	to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

	We estimate the fair value of warrant granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The expected life of warrant represents the term of warrant. The expected stock volatility is based on the average of historical volatility of the Companys common stock and other subjective factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted, and the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and managements intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion. Selling, general and administrative
	expenses relating to warrants issued for services totaled $66,024 and $383,102 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses relating to warrants issued for services totaled $372,475 and $2,309,643, respectively.


	The fair value of each warrant granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants during the the nine months ended December 31:

	The

	2011 Equity Incentive Plan

	(2011 Plan) provides for issuing equity awards for an aggregate of 3.5 million shares of our common stock in the form of grants of restricted shares, incentive stock options (employees only), non-qualified stock options, share appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance units. The purposes of the Plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors, and consultants, and to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company. Stock option awards have
	a maximum contractual life of ten years and specific vesting terms and performance goals are addressed in each equity award grant. Shares issued to satisfy awards may be from authorized but unissued or reacquired common stock. On June 1, 2016, the Company filed a Form S-8 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register its

	2016 Equity Incentive Plan

	(2016 Plan), which registered 3,000,000 shares of the 6,000,000 shares issuable under the plan.

	Stock Options


	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The expected life of options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and other subjective factors. The expected stock volatility is based on the average of historical volatility of the Companys common stock and other subjective factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted, and the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and managements intention to retain all earnings for
	future operations and expansion. No forfeiture is expected when stock options are granted.


	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company awarded zero and 2,106,000 stock options for shares of common stock. Stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $989,488. Options with a weighted-average exercise price of $0.74 per share for 3,480,000 shares were outstanding at December 31, 2016. Intrinsic value is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option. Intrinsic value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $127,500 and $0,
	respectively. At December 31, 2016, outstanding options are fully vested and the weighted-average remaining contractual term was 8.4 years; however, if services are earlier terminated, 3,480,000 options become void 90 days after termination.


	The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted average assumptions for the grants during the nine months ended December 31, 2015:

	Basic (loss) per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per share by application of
	the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.

	REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


	To the Board of Directors and

	Shareholders of MoneyOnMobile, Inc.


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MoneyOnMobile, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MoneyOnMobile, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	1  OVERVIEW




	The Company


	In these consolidated financial statements, references to MoneyOnMobile, Company, we, us, and our collectively refers to MoneyOnMobile, Inc., and its majority-owned Indian enterprise, which includes Digital Payment Processing Limited (DPPL), My Mobile Payments Limited (MMPL) and Payblox Technologies (India) Private Limited (Payblox). All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company operates one distinct business unit, which is located in India.


	MoneyOnMobile


	MoneyOnMobile offers electronic wallet services in India. MoneyOnMobile can be used to pay for goods and services and sending or receiving money using mobile phone text messages, smart phone or internet. Consumers are often required to prepay for certain utilities, such as mobile phone services. Because bank accounts and credit cards are only used by a small portion of the Indian population, consumers typically prepay for these utilities with cash, either directly to utility providers or through distributors. MoneyOnMobile acts as an intermediary between a) the utility provider and distributors, b) distributors and consumers,
	and c) consumer and other parties.


	As an intermediary between the utility provider and distributors, MoneyOnMobile purchases utility units, such as mobile phone minutes, at wholesale rates and resells these units to distributors. MoneyOnMobile maintains an inventory of these utility units held for resell. As an intermediate between distributors and consumers, distributors use MoneyOnMobiles electronic wallet technology to a) allow consumers to purchase utility units from the distributor by mobile phone text message and b) allow distributors to send a text message confirmation back to the consumer. MoneyOnMobile earns a transaction fee for these services,
	paid by the consumer. Once a consumer has established a MoneyOnMobile electronic wallet account, consumers can use MoneyOnMobiles technology to facilitate non-distributor-related transactions with other parties that have MoneyOnMobile accounts, including other retailers and utilities and other MoneyOnMobile consumers. MoneyOnMobile also earns a transaction fee for these services, paid by the consumer.


	In March 2012, the Company began acquiring common stock of Digital Payments Processing Limited (DPPL). During 2012, DPPL entered into an exclusive services agreement with My Mobile Payments Limited (MMPL), an entity that shares common ownership with DPPL. DPPL maintains a services agreement with My Mobile Payments Limited (MMPL) to deliver payment processing services in India. Both companies are organized under the laws of India and headquartered in Mumbai, India.


	Additionally, Payblox Technologies (India) Private Limited (Payblox), a wholly owned subsidiary of MMPL, organized in October 2010 under the laws of India and headquartered in Mumbai, India, provides certain back office and support services on behalf of MMPL to its MoneyOnMobile service customer base. Collectively, DPPL, MMPL, and Payblox Technology (India) Private Limited (Payblox), operate the MoneyOnMobile enterprise. MoneyOnMobile is operated locally by a management team based in Mumbai, India, with corporate oversight provided by the executive management based in Dallas, Texas. MMPL currently has a
	license from the Reserve Bank of India to operate a payments system. Renewal of the license is required in October 2018, and DPPL intends to seek renewal and has no reason to believe it will not receive such renewal.


	In January 2014, the Company acquired a majority of the common stock of DPPL, obtaining control of DPPL and, through DPPLs services agreement, obtaining control of MMPL and Payblox. As such, MMPL has been determined to be Variable Interest Entity, in the Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements. Prior to obtaining control in January 2014, MoneyOnMobile was accounted for an equity method investment.


	On March 31, 2015, MMPL and DPPL executed an business purchase agreement, whereby MMPL purchased all the assets of DPPL. The impact of this business combination has been eliminated upon consolidated, as the Company maintained financial control of both entities since January 2014.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	1  OVERVIEW   (continued)


	Sale of U.S. Operations


	Effective November 30, 2015 (11:59 pm), the Company divested its U.S. Operations, excluding executive headquarters. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. In consideration for the acquired assets, the buyer assumed certain of the Companys liabilities, including an aggregate of $8.3 million of notes payable and certain of the Sellers outstanding contractual obligations. See Note 17:

	Sale of U.S. Operations

	for additional details.


	2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	Preparation of Financial Statements


	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our conclusions. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include reveune recogniton, valuation of
	financial instruments, goodwill, fair value measurements and business combinations.


	Basis of Presentation


	We consolidate entities over which we have control, as typically evidenced by a voting control of greater than 50% or for which we are the primary beneficiary, whereby we have the power to direct the most significant activities and the obligation to absorb significant losses or receive significant benefits from the entity. We separately present our noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. For affiliates we do not control but where significant influence over financial and operating policies exists, as typically evidenced by a voting control of 20% to 50%, the investment is accounted for using the equity
	method. In addition, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of all variable interest entities for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date such determination is made. All significant inter-company investments, accounts, and transactions have been eliminated.


	Disposition of Assets


	On November 30, 2015, CLPI consummated the sale of Calpian Commerce, Inc. and certain portfolio assets of CLPI and CRA. As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods presented and the (loss) gain on disposal have been included in Net (loss) income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, these assets and liabilities have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2015 retroactively. See note 17  

	Sale of U.S. Operations

	for additional information.


	Going Concern


	The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $(19,727,913)and $(9,356,411) for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.


	The Company is continuing with its plan to further grow and expand its mobile payment processing operations in India. Management believes that its current operating strategy will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern as long as it continues to obtain additional financing; however, there is no assurance this will occur. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	Reclassifications


	Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.


	Fair Value Measurements


	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company believes the carrying values of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and interest payable approximate their fair values. Additionally, the Company believes the carrying value of its senior notes, subordinated notes, and note payable approximate the estimated fair value for debt with similar terms, interest rates, and remaining maturities currently available to companies
	with similar credit ratings.


	The estimated fair value of our common stock issued in share-based payments is measured by the more relevant of: (i) the prices received in private placement sales of our stock or; (ii) its publicly-quoted market price. We estimate the fair value of warrants, other than those included in common stock unit purchases, and stock options when issued or vested using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Recognition in shareholders equity and expense of the fair value of stock options awarded to employees is on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period
	and, for grants to non-employees, when the options vest. The fair value of exercisable warrants on the date of issuance issued in connection with debt financing transactions or for services are deferred and expensed over the term of the debt or as services are performed.


	Convertible Instruments


	Certain debt instrument require us to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. This criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
	changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.


	Derivative Financial Instruments


	We classifiy as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares providing that such contracts are indexed to our common stock. We classify as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Companys control) or (ii) gives the counter party a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We assesses classification of its
	common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.


	Our free standing derivatives consist of embedded conversion options with a convertible note. The Company evaluated these derivatives to assess their proper classification in the consolidated balance sheets using the applicable classification criteria enumerated under ASC 815-Derivatives and Hedging. The Company determined that certain embedded conversion features do not contain fixed settlement provisions. As a result, we were required to record the conversion option associated with the debt as an embedded derivative. We previously recorded this liability as a derivative liability within current liabilities in our historical
	consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the value of this derivative liability has been marked-to-market at the end of each

	reporting period and recorded as Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any outstanding convertible instruments thtat would be classified as a derivative.


	Foreign Currency Translation


	The functional currency of MoneyOnMobile, consisting of DPPL and the variable interest entities MMPL and Payblox, is the Indian Rupee. MoneyOnMobile assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each consolidated balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at quarterly average exchange rates and resulting translation gains or losses are accumulated in other comprehensive loss as a separate component within the accompanying statements of shareholders equity. Additionally, cumulative translation adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
	noncontrolling interest proportionally based on the weighted average percentage ownership interest held by the noncontrolling interest.


	Cash and Equivalents


	We consider cash, deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash and equivalents. Our deposits at financial institutions at times exceed amounts covered by U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance.


	Due from Distributors


	Amounts represent purchases made by MoneyOnMobile consumers for which payment was made to an agent. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, there were one and three distributors, which comprised 92% and 80%, respectively.


	Property and Equipment


	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three to five years. The building purchased in India has an estimated useful life of 39 years. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the assets carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated
	statements of operations and comprehensive operations.


	Equity Investment


	Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balance. The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. No impairments were recorded during years ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.


	Deferred Financing Costs


	The Company capitalizes third-party costs paid to obtain its debt financing. Capitalized costs are then amortized using a straight-line basis over the related debt term into interest expense.


	Business Combinations


	We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to

	intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer lists, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
	with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.


	Goodwill


	Goodwill consists of the cost of our acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is allocated to reporting units based on the relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit.


	We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08,
	Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value
	of goodwill is written down to fair value.


	After reviewing the results of multiple valuation models, a weighted average approach on a financial controlling basis was considered most appropriate comprised of an 80% weight to the market approach (40% precedent transactions (subject company), 15% precedent transactions (comparable company) and 25% guideline public company) and a 20% weight to the income approach (20% discounted cash flow). Additionally, other information such as current market, industry and macro economic conditions were utilized to assist to develop these fair value measurements.


	For its MoneyOnMobile annual impairment assessment for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. As a result, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired for the year ended March 31, 2016 or 2015. The percentage that fair value of goodwill exceeded carrying value as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 was 91.3% and 23.9%, respectively.


	Intangible Assets


	Intangible assets consist of software (excluding computer software), customer lists, trademarks, distributor contracts and domain names acquired through business combinations, or consists of software developed or obtained for internal use, as well as software intended for resale. Costs to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized on a per project basis and are amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life. Capitalized costs for internally developed software during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $530,015 and $115,440, respectively.

	Costs for software developed for resale are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established, capitalized once technological feasibility occurs, including costs for coding and testing, and expensed once the software is available for release to customers. Capitalized costs for software available for sale are amortized over the greater of the amounts computed for the (1) expected revenue to total anticipated revenue or (2) straight line basis over its estimated useful life. Capitalized costs for software developed for resale during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $0 for both periods.


	The weighted average amortization period is five years for customer lists, acquisition costs and trademarks, five years for internal use software, three years for software developed for resale and domain names are not amortized. Capitalized finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but reviewed at least annually for potential impairment.


	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets


	In addition to the annual goodwill impairment test, long-lived assets, including property and equipment and other intangible assets, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life
	assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life. There were no adjustments to the carrying value or useful lives of long-lived assets (other than goodwill) during the years ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.


	Revenue Recognition


	The Company recognizes revenue when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been performed; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has three primary revenue streams: residual portfolios, merchant payment processing fees, and MoneyOnMobile transactions.


	The following revenue recognition policies define the manner in which the Company accounts for sales transactions:



	MoneyOnMobile



	A significant portion of revenue is attributable to Merchant Services, including Mobile Recharge and Direct-to-Home. In these transactions, revenue from purchased utility units is recognized on a net basis, as the Company is acting in an agent capacity. MoneyOnMobile does not change the product or perform part of the service, has minimal discretion in supplier selection, has minimal latitude in establishing prices and possesses no credit risk.


	Other services offered are Consumer Services, including bill payment and money transfer. For bill payment transactions, MoneyOnMobile acts as an agent with consumers. Distributors use MoneyOnMobiles electronic wallet technology to allow consumers to pay utility bills by mobile phone text message and smart phone. MoneyOnMobile earns a fixed transaction fee for these services. For our money transfer services, once a consumer has established a MoneyOnMobile electronic wallet account, consumers can use MoneyOnMobiles technology to facilitate non-distributor-related transactions with other parties that have
	MoneyOnMobile accounts, including other retailers and utilities and other MoneyOnMobile consumers. MoneyOnMobile also earns a fixed transaction fee for these services.

	Distributors often keep a prepaid balance with MoneyOnMobile to facilitate transactions. Prepaid balances are deferred until utility units are delivered. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, advances from distributors was $4,013,509 and $658,346, respectively.


	Revenue from the above services and transaction fees are recognized on a net basis, as the Company is not the primary obligor, does not establish prices and does not maintain inventory or credit risk.


	Income Taxes


	Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future income tax effects of differences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax return purposes, including undistributed foreign earnings and losses, using enacted tax laws and rates. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. Tax liabilities, together with interest and applicable penalties included in the income tax provision, are recognized for the benefits, if any, of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements which, more likely than not,
	may not be realized.


	Advertising


	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, advertising expense was $1,485,467 and $301,925, respectively.


	Recent Accounting Pronouncements


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. On July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.


	In February 2016, the FASB issued its final lease accounting standard, FASB Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases, which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the effect that ASC 842 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard is to be applied under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, among other changes, related to stock-based compensation. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.


	There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted or recently issued pronouncements that we expect to have a material effect on the presentation or disclosure of our future consolidated operating results, cash flows or financial condition.

	As part of our acquisition of MoneyOnMobile enterprise in January 2014, we acquired a 40% equity interest in Happy Cellular Services Limited (Happy Cellular). Happy Cellular is a mobile talk time reseller based in India. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, our equity investment balance was $190,172 and $201,600, respectively.


	GreedyGame Media Pvt. Limited


	During the year ended March 31, 2016, MMPL purchased shares of GreedyGame Media Pvt. Limited (GreedyGame). GreedyGame is a mobile marketing company based in India. Our investment balance at March 31, 2016 was $18,153.


	VARIABLE INTERST ENTITIES


	A VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis of voting control. We consolidate our VIEs where we determine that we have both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE.


	My Mobile Payments Limited


	We did not hold a majority ownership interest in MMPL at either March 31, 2016 or 2015. Therefore, our determination of whether to consolidate is based upon the power to direct the activities that significantly impact the economic success of these entities. We are the primary beneficiary of MMPL as we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest due to having both a) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its financial performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses that potentially could be significant.

	Contractual terms that may change the powers held in future periods, such as a purchase or sale options, are not considered in our analysis. Based on our analysis, we believe that we hold the power and rights to direct the most significant activities of MMPL and as a result the financial results of MMPL from the acquisition date of January 6, 2014 have been consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the year ending March 31, 2015, the Company invested $4,906,760 to acquire 8.17% of MMPL This investment was necessary to support local management in executing its growth plans. No direct investment
	was made by the Company to MMPL during the year ending March 31, 2016.


	At March 31, 2015 DDPL and MMPL entered into a business transfer agreement, in which DDPL acquired substantially all of MMPL. As these entities were previously accounted for as a business combination on January 6, 2014, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction in the consolidated financial statements due to maintaining financial control over MMPL.


	Net income or loss and comprehensive income or loss are attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests. We elected to utilize a weighted average value calculation based on relative ownership interest of MoneyOnMobile for the year ended March 31, 2016. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 this calculation was based on relative ownership interest of each individual entity: DPPL and MMPL. As of March 31, 2015, the allocation of DPPL and MMPL to our controlling interest was 71.9% and 7.0%, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company invested $3,184,614 to purchase additional shares of DPPL. As of March
	31, 2016 the weighted average ownership allocation MoneyOnMobile to our controlling interest was 72.5%.

	During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, debt discount accreted into interest expense was $80,919 and $103,846, respectively, and are presented as part of discontinued operations. During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company made principal payments on the senior promissory notes of $4,093,162 and $81,888, respectively. Additionally, the remaining Deferred Finance Costs totaling $394,481 were written off as of November 30, 2015 and were included in the calculation of Loss on Sale of U.S. Operations. See note 17  

	Sale of U.S. Operations

	.


	Subordinated Notes Payable


	The Companys subordinated debt has been issued pursuant to a $3 million Subordinated Debt Offering and a separate $2 million Subordinated Debt Offering. Each offering is exempt from registration under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as described in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 6, 2011 and August 10, 2012. The notes are secured by a first lien on substantially all of the Companys assets, but are subordinated to the senior credit facility. The notes bear interest at a rate of 12% annually paid monthly in arrears.


	On December 30, 2014, the Company amended the subordinated notes payable to extend the maturity to December 31, 2016. In consideration for the maturity extension, the notes were amended to add a conversion feature, which gives the note holder the option to convert the notes at a price equal to $1.00 per share of common stock. Furthermore, the Company has the option, upon three day prior written notice, to require the note holders to convert the outstanding principal of the note into common stock if the share price equals or exceeds $2.00 in any ninety (90) day trading period.


	The Company also granted the note holders a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock for every $1,000,000 of outstanding principal at the time of the amendment. The 960,000 warrants had a fair value at issuance of $442,400 using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The modification date discount value is amortized over the remaining term of the modified debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 16.75%. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, amortized debt discount included in interest expense totaled $191,967 and $179,892, respectively. During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company made
	principal payments of $1,600,000 and $0, respectively.


	In March 2016, the Company extended the maturity date on its remaining subordinated debt from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. As part of this agreement, the Company issued to debt holders 3,200,000 warrants, which possessed an aggregate fair value of $1,267,817 at issuance using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 1,000,000 of these warrants were subsequently canceled prior to year-end and reissued with an extended maturity date.

	Convertible Promissory Note


	Effective September 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hall Phoenix/Inwood, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership (Hall), whereby the Company received $2,000,000, and issued a convertible promissory note (the Hall Note) secured by all the assets of the Company and accrues interest at an annual rate of 10% and a maturity date of September 16, 2016. Pursuant to the Agreement, Hall has the option to convert outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest of the Note at a price per share equal to the lower of (a) $0.60 or (b) 85% of the average volume weighted price of the
	Companys common stock for the ten trading days preceding the date on which Hall gives written notice of conversion to the Company. On December 30, 2015, the Company sold to Hall, 450,379 of its shares held in its majority-owned subsidiary DPPL, reducing the Companys share ownership of DDPL to 61.3% at December 31, 2015. As consideration, the Hall Note was considered repaid in full.

	Notes Payable and Promissory Notes


	In October 2015, the Company received $6,000,000 from various investors as part of a debt subscription agreement, which was specific to facilitating the sale of the Companys U.S. Operations. As part of this sale, the entire debt was assumed by the purchaser of the U.S. Operations. Additionally, short term notes totaling $59,434 were issued to the note holders to account for the interest that was incurred by the Company while the funds were in escrow and have a maturity date of December 31, 2016.


	In April 2016, and as part of the Companys settlement agreement with the buyer of its U.S. Operations, the Company issued two new promissory notes, First, $727,285, of which $720,084 was the note balance included in the Asset Purchase Agreement, with the remaining balance as subsequent interest incurred. This note possessed an interest rate of 12% per annum payable monthly, matures on December 31, 2017. Second, the Company issued the buyer a $675,000 note in exchange for the buyer waiving any claims for breach of the Purchase Agreement between the buyer and the Company. Additionally, the Company escrowed 2,000,000 shares
	of its common stock as a guarantee of repayment for the $675,000 note.


	Lastly, the Company issued three notes totaling $546,440, which represented the remaining outstanding debt of CRA that was not included as part of the sale of U.S. Operations at March 31, 2016. These loans have a maturity date of December 31, 2016.


	India Office Building Mortgage


	In May 2014, My Mobile Payments Limited obtained a $2,254,500 loan with Union Bank of India to purchase an office building to be used as its headquarters. The loan was interest only for the first six months at the rate of 16% per annum. Thereafter, the interest rate is 15% per annum, and principal and interest payments are to be made in 26 equal quarterly payments. The loan matures in May 2021 and is collateralized by the building.


	During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, MMPL refinanced its office building loan by paying off its loan with the Union Bank of India, and replacing it with a $2,198,000 loan with Standard Chartered. The new loan is at a variable interest of 11.10% per annum with principal and interest payments to be made in 180 equal monthly payments.


	Future principal payments due under the Companys debt, excluding debt discounts of $(1,212,580), for the fiscal years ending March 31:

	11  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


	We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity
	to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

	11  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   (continued)


	ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:






	Level 1  


	quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities








	Level 2  


	quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable








	Level 3  


	inputs that are unobservable based on an entitys own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)





	There were no financial liabilities as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 measured at fair value on a recurring basis.


	In September 2015, the Company determined that a certain conversion option related to a convertible note did not have fixed settlement provisions and was deemed to be a derivative financial instrument, since the exercise price was subject to adjustment based on certain changes in market price of the Companys common stock. Accordingly, the Company was required to record such conversion option as a liability and mark such derivative to fair value each reporting period. Such instrument was classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. However, the note was exchanged prior to March 31, 2016.


	The fair value of the conversion option was calculated using a binomial lattice formula with the following weighted average assumptions during the nine months ended December 31, 2015. The financial instrument was exchanged on December 30, 2015 and was created on September 17, 2015:

	The risk-free interest rate is the United States Treasury rate on the measurement date having a term equal to the remaining contractual life of the instrument. The volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys share price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. The dividend yield is 0% as the Company has not made any dividend payment and has no plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.


	Level 3 liabilities are valued using unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the derivative liabilities. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, determine its valuation policies and procedures. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of management.


	Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the derivative liabilities for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate.


	Significant observable and unobservable inputs include stock price, exercise price, annual risk free rate, term, and expected volatility, and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An increase or decrease in volatility or interest free rate, in isolation, can significantly increase or decrease the fair value of the derivative

	We estimate the fair value of warrant granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The expected life of warrant represents the term of warrant. The expected stock volatility is based on the average of historical volatility of the Companys common stock and other subjective factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted, and the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and managements intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion. Warrants issued for services included in
	selling, general and administrative expenses was $3,256,309 and $13,301 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	(Plan) provides for issuing equity awards for an aggregate of 3.5 million shares of our common stock in the form of grants of restricted shares, incentive stock options (employees only), non-qualified stock options, share appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance units. The purposes of the Plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors, and consultants, and to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company. Stock option awards have a
	maximum contractual life of ten years and specific vesting terms and performance goals are addressed in each equity award grant. Shares issued to satisfy awards may be from authorized but unissued or reacquired common stock.

	Stock Options


	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The expected life of options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and other subjective factors. The expected stock volatility is based on the average of historical volatility of the Companys common stock and other subjective factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted, and the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and managements intention to retain all earnings for
	future operations and expansion. No forfeiture is expected when stock options are granted.


	During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company awarded 2,800,000 and 1,360,000 stock options for shares of common stock. Stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $1,216,146 and $1,240,139 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Options with a weighted-average exercise price of $0.74 per share for 3,480,000 shares were outstanding at March 31, 2016. Intrinsic value is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option. Intrinsic value at March 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $650,000 and $0, respectively. At March 31,
	2016, outstanding options are fully vested and the weighted-average remaining contractual term was 9.2 years; however, if services are earlier terminated, 3,480,000 options become void 90 days after termination.

	13  EARNINGS PER SHARE


	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
	treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.


	Our shareholder equity includes a line item for subscribed stock, which represents shares of common stock for which we irrevocably received investors purchase prices but, due to administrative delays, had not issued the respective shares of common stock before the period end. These shares have been included in the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period for the purposes of calculating basic earnings per share.


	The computation of basic and diluted loss per share as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period. Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

We adjust our deferred income tax liabilities and assets, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred income tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. We recognize uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns at the
	largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, no such uncertain income tax benefits were recognized.

	Prior to the DPPL acquisition on January 7, 2014, the Company owned 49.9% of DPPL, a loss company at the time of the acquisition. As a result of this acquisition we obtained certain foreign net operating losses. In the U.S., loss carryforwards are subject to IRC Section 382 of the Code which may limit the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than 50% change in ownership). We do not expect the IRC Section 382 limitation to materially impact the deferred tax asset as it relates to the NOL. The provision for income taxes is due entirely to MMPL and is payable
	to the Indian Government.

	On January 1, 2011, the Company signed a two years management advisory agreement with Cagan McAfee Capital Partners, LLC (CMCP), an investment company owned and controlled by Laird Cagan, a member of our Board of Directors and a significant shareholder. The nonexclusive agreement provides for CMCP advising the Company on financial and strategic matters and provides for the services of Mr. Cagan as a member of our Board. Pursuant to the agreement, CMCP is to be paid $14,500 per month plus expenses. In December 2013, the agreement was extended through December 2015, at which time the agreement was terminated and now
	additional interest is to be incurred on amounts outstanding as of that date. Previously, interest accrued on unpaid balances at 12% per annum. The amounts due, including interest, to CMCP totaled $711,805 and $535,630 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is recorded in Related party payables in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.


	Cagan Capital, LLC


	In 2011, Cagan Capital, LLC (CCLLC), an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Cagan, purchased $1.0 million of our subordinated notes payable and warrants to purchase up to 500,000 shares of our common stock at $1.00 per share on a cashless basis. During the year ended March 31, 2016, these warrants were exchanged and reissued with extended maturity dates. See Laird Cagan section below for additional details. In connection with the extension of the maturity date of the subordinated notes in 2012, CCLLC was issued an additional 71,233 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at $2.00 per share. There were no
	subordinated debt principal payments in 2016 or 2015 and interest paid at 12% per annum totaled $120,000 in 2016 and $110,000 in 2015.


	In 2014, Mr. Cagan purchased $1.0 million of CRA secured promissory notes payable at an interest rate of 12% per annum and warrants to purchase up to 175,000 shares of MoneyOnMobile common stock at $0.01 per share. The outstanding principal amount of this loan may be converted to MoneyOnMobile common stock at any time by dividing the outstanding principal and any accrued interest by $2.00 per share. Principal payments made during the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $68,665 and $32,833. Interest paid totaled $82,450 and $119,837 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015.


	Laird Cagan


	In March 2016, the Company executed an one year advisory agreement with Mr. Cagan and issued one million warrants. Additionally, Mr. Cagan received 1,000,000 warrants as part of its subordinated notes payable modification. See note 6:

	Debt

	for more information. These warrants and those held by Mr. Cagan, totaling 2.5 million warrants, were canceled and reissued in order to extend the maturity date. This resulted in a non-cash expense of $314,623 and is recorded in Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.


	As discussed in note 10:

	Debt

	, in April 2016, and as part of the Companys sale of its U.S. Operations, the Company issued Laird Cagan a promissory notes for $727,285, of which $720,084 was the note balance included in the Asset Purchase Agreement, with the remaining balance as subsequent interest incurred.

	PUT LIABILITY  NONCONTROLLING INVESTMENT


	On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with HALL MOM, LLC., a Texas limited liability company (HALL MOM). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and in satisfaction of a $2,000,000 loan made to the Company by Hall, the Company issued and sold equity shares representing 10% of the total paid up share capital of DPPL, on a fully diluted basis (the Sale Shares) to Hall. In addition to the debt satisfaction, Hall agreed to return to the Company for cancellation 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock and warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of the Companys
	common stock.


	As part of the Share Purchase Agreement, HALL MOM possessed an option for the Company to buyback its investment for $3,000,000. On March 15, 2016, HALL MOM exercised its option, which required repayment by July 13, 2016. At March 31, 2016, the Company recorded its obligation as a current liability. As of August 19

(eVance) to divest its Calpian Commerce business segment and certain other U.S. residual portfolio assets of MoneyOnMobile, Inc., including Calpian Residual Acquisition, LLC and its equity investment in Calpian Granite Hill, L.P. This action was undertaken to allow the Company to focus entirely on executing its growth strategy for MoneyOnMobile. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. In consideration for the acquired assets, eVance assumed certain
	of the Companys liabilities, including an aggregate of $9,000,000 of notes payable and certain of the Sellers outstanding contractual obligations.

	On April 12, 2016, the Company and eVance entered into a purchase price adjustment agreement and a cancellation of securities acknowledgment with one of eVances note holders whereby the note holder canceled their note in the amount of $720,084, which was subsequently reissued by the Company to the note holder. Additionally, the Company issued eVance a note in the amount of $675,000. The $675,000 note bears interest of 12% per annum payable monthly, matures on November 30, 2017 and is secured by 2,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. These common share were issued subsequent to March 31, 2016 and are
	maintained in escrow. As part of the Purchase Agreement, eVance acquired several residual portfolios including the supporting contracts (residual purchase agreements). eVance, as successor under one of these residual purchase agreements, has sued a third party for breach of contract on the residual purchase agreement between the third party and the Company and has claimed damages in excess of $1,500,000. eVance has agreed to apply any recovery from such litigation (less costs) against the principle balance of the $675,000 note issued by the Company up to a maximum of $675,000.


	ASC 360-10-45-9 requires that a long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which a set of criteria have been met, including criteria that the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. This criteria was achieved on June 30, 2015. Additionally, the discontinued operations are comprised of the entirety of the Calpian Commerce segment and the majority of the remaining U.S. Operations segment, excluding corporate
	services expenses. Lastly, for comparability purposes certain prior period line items relating to the assets held for sale have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss and the consolidated balance sheets.


	As the Companys senior secured promissory note was required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction, the relating interest on this debt instrument has been allocated in its entirety to discontinued operations. No other interest has been allocated to discontinued operations.

	Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.


	Our Bylaws provide that we must indemnify and hold harmless our directors, officers, and other persons referenced in our Certificate of Formation as and to the extent permitted by the Texas Business Corporation Act. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Texas.


	The Texas Business Organizations Code, or the TBOC, permits a corporation to indemnify a director who was, is or is threatened to be a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding as a result of the performance of his duties if such person acted in good faith and, in the case of conduct in the persons official capacity as a director, in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in all other cases, that the person reasonably believed his conduct was not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had no
	reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The TBOC further permits a corporation to eliminate in its charter all monetary liability of the corporations directors to the corporation or its shareholders for conduct in performance of such directors duties. Our charter provides that a director of the corporation will not be liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for any act or omission by the director in the performance of his duties, except that there will be no limitation of liability to the extent the director has been found liable under applicable law for: (i) breach of the directors duty of loyalty owed to the corporation or its shareholders; (ii) an act or omission not in good faith that constitutes a breach of duty of the director to the corporation or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law; (iii) a transaction from which the director received an improper benefit, regardless of whether the
	benefit resulted from an action taken within the scope of the directors duties; or (iv) an act or omission for which the liability of the director is expressly provided for by an applicable statute.


	Sections 8.101 and 8.103 of the TBOC provide that a corporation may indemnify a person who was, is or is threatened to be a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding because the person is or was a director only if a determination is made that such indemnification is permissible under the TBOC: (i) by a majority vote of the directors who at the time of the vote are disinterested and independent, regardless of whether such directors constitute a quorum; (ii) by a majority vote of a board committee designated by a majority of disinterested and independent directors and consisting solely of disinterested and independent
	directors; (iii) by special legal counsel selected by the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors as set forth in (i) or (ii); (iv) by the shareholders in a vote that excludes the shares held by directors who are not disinterested and independent; or (v) by a unanimous vote of the shareholders.

	Section 8.104 of the TBOC provides that the corporation may pay or reimburse, in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding, reasonable expenses incurred by a present director who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding after the corporation receives a written affirmation by the director of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under Section 8.101 and a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that he has not met that standard or if it is
	ultimately determined that indemnification of the director is not otherwise permitted under the TBOC. Section 8.105 also provides that reasonable expenses incurred by a former director or officer, or a present or former employee or agent of the corporation, who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding may be paid or reimbursed by the corporation, in advance of the final disposition of the action, as the corporation considers appropriate.


	Section 8.105 of the TBOC provides that a corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to a person who is not a director, including an officer, employee or agent of the corporation as provided by: (i) the corporations governing documents; (ii) an action by the corporations governing authority; (iii) resolution by the shareholders; (iv) contract; or (v) common law. As consistent with Section 8.105, a corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to persons who are not directors to the same extent that a corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to directors.


	Further, our amended and restated certificate of formation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by law. We are also expressly required to advance certain expenses to our directors and officers and carry directors and officers insurance providing indemnification for our directors and officers for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification provisions and the directors and officers insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers.


	We have also entered into, or will enter into prior to the completion of this offering, indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers. The indemnification agreements provide, among other things, for indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law and our amended and restated certificate of formation and amended and restated bylaws against (i) any and all direct and indirect liabilities and reasonable expenses, including judgments, fines, penalties, interest and amounts paid in settlement of any claim with our approval and reasonable counsel fees and disbursements, (ii) any liability
	pursuant to a loan guarantee, or otherwise, for any of our indebtedness and (iii) any liabilities incurred as a result of acting on behalf of us (as a fiduciary or otherwise) in connection with an employee benefit plan. The indemnification agreements also provide for, or will provide for, the advancement or payment of expenses to the indemnitee and for reimbursement to us if it is found that such indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification under applicable law and our amended and restated certificate of formation and amended and restated bylaws.


	We expect to maintain standard policies of insurance that provide coverage (1) to our directors and officers against loss rising from claims made by reason of breach of duty or other wrongful act and (2) to us with respect to indemnification payments that we may make to such directors and officers. The underwriting agreement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of us and our officers and directors, and by us of the underwriters, for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act or otherwise in connection with this offering.


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us under any of the foregoing provisions, in the opinion of the SEC, that indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
