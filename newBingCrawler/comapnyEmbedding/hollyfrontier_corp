HollyFrontier operates 5 refineries:

Cheyenne (Cheyenne, WY) - 52,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of crude oil capacity
El Dorado (El Dorado, KS) - 135,000 bbl/d
Navajo (Artesia, NM) - 100,000 bbl/d
Tulsa (Tulsa, OK) - 125,000 bbl/d
Woods Cross (Woods Cross, UT) - 45,000 bbl/d

The company also maintains the following divisions:

Holly Energy Partners - logistical assets including pipelines, terminals, and tankage
Lubricants and Specialty Products - manufacturing and marketing of lubricants specialty products
Asphalt - commodity and modified asphalt products are marketed in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico
