◆Summary 
Formulated the new medium to long-term
growth strategy “elematec x (cross)”; targeting growth markets through
globalization and modularization
Elematec Corporation
<2715> (also, referred to as the Company below) is an electronics trading
company that specializes in electronic materials. It was formed through the
merger of Takachiho Electric Co., Ltd. and Ohnishi Denki Co., Ltd. in 2009 and
entered the TOYOTA TSUSHO CORPORATION <8015> Group in 2012. 
1. Sales and profits
weakened in FY3/17, though posted second highest net sales and third highest
operating income 
Elematec reported weaker sales
and profits in FY3/17 at ¥203,004mn
in net sales (-6.4% YoY) and ¥5,406mn
in operating income (-21.3%). These results missed initial forecast, but
exceeded lowered targets and posted second highest net sales and third highest
operating income. We think it turned in a solid performance, despite pressure
from roughly ¥30,000mn YoY decline in
smartphone-related sales. 
2. Globalization and
modularization are key words in the growth strategy 
Elematec formulated a medium
to long-term growth strategy with the new slogan “elematec x (cross).” It sets globalization and modularization
as key words for medium to long-term growth. In “globalization,” Elematec seeks to leverage an overseas
network to arrange direct accounts with end users worldwide. In “modularization,” Elematec plans and designs products that
meet customer requirements and are sold as intermediate “component modules,” rather than selling individual items as
standalone products. This approach strives to increase added value for
planning, design, and production and thereby expand the Company’s earnings. 
3. Expects increases
in sales and profits in FY3/18, planning to sharply raise the dividend thanks
to a rebound in Profit attributable owners of parent 
The
FY3/18 forecast aims for increases in sales and profits with net sales at ¥205,000mn (+1.0% YoY) and operating
income at ¥5,800mn (+7.3%). Demand in
smartphone-related business, which switched to a recovery from 2Q FY3/17,
remains upbeat thus far in the new fiscal year. While Elematec takes a cautious
view because of concerns about ramp up of OLEDs for smartphones from 2H, its
current forecast appears conservative in light of the weaker yen trend in forex
rates and other tailwinds. Elematec intends to pay a sharply higher dividend
owing to a significant rebound in profit attributable owners of parent on
non-recurrence of extraordinary losses.




◆Company overview 
Two companies with specialties in
electronic materials merged in 2009, broadened to the automotive field by
entering the Toyota Tsusho Group
1. History and business overview 
The Company’s predecessors were Takachiho Electric,
established in 1947 in Tokyo, and Ohnishi Denki, founded in 1958 in Kyoto. Both
companies began by handling insulation materials, subsequently broadened the
scope of their product offerings to electronic materials used in electronic
products following technology and development trends, and grew into being
independent technology trading companies. 
These companies merged in 2009
(with Takachiho Electric as the surviving entity) and adopted the Elematec
name. The Company has steadily grown since the merger, even though both
predecessors mainly handled electronic materials, thanks to complementary
geographical positions in Tokyo and Kyoto. It became a subsidiary of Toyota
Tsusho through a TOB transaction in 2012, and this is its current position. 
The Company had 1,172 employees on a consolidated basis as of
the end of FY3/17. It operates a domestic service network with 21 sites and an
overseas service network with 39 sites. Regional sales breakdown consists of
Japan at 57.5%, China (including Hong Kong) at 22.4%, other Asia (Taiwan,
Korea, India, and Southeast Asia) at 16.8%, and the US and Europe (US, Mexico,
and Czech) at 3.3%.


Possesses strengths in planning and
development that leverage a broad range of customers and products as well as
robust operational capabilities
2. Company features and strengths 
As explained in previous
reports (including the report issued on December 16, 2016), we think Elematec
possesses the following attributes and strengths: 1) significant diversity in
counterparts and products, 2) flexible support for growth markets, and 3)
manufacturing functions. To help in gaining an even deeper understanding of
these features and strengths, below we analyze Elematec from the standpoint of
services and functions its supplies to customers. 
Elematec operates 60 sites in
Japan and other countries and handles transactions of electronic materials and
electronic components among about 6,000 supplier firms (roughly 4,000 in Japan
and 2,000 from other countries) and 5,800 customer companies (around 3,600 in Japan
and 2,200 in other countries). 
Elematec goes beyond just the basic services and functions of an
electronics trading company of optimal supply of parts and materials, credit
provision and financing, and delivery timing and inventory management. It also supplies
processing services, integrated procurement services, and other more advanced
services and functions that gen­erate higher added value. While Elematec
highlights five services and functions, we think integrated procurement
services, processing services, and planning and development functions stand out
as core features and strengths.


(1)
Integrated procurement services 
Integrated procurement services covers procurement of raw
materials for customers plus internal logistics at customers. Key points are
finding and procuring ideal parts and materials that meet the specifications
required by users from roughly 6,000 domestic and overseas suppliers and
supplying these items on a just-in-time basis to domestic and overseas plants
of customer companies with Elematec responsible for quality and delivery timing
management. We think this service provides differentiation from rivals and
contributes to customer retention because few companies are capable of
effectively handling this full range of operations. 
We expect demand for integrated procurement services delivered
by Elematec to continue growing, particularly in light of chronic manpower
shortages in sections in charge of procurement and internal logistics, even at
many large companies, amid efforts to improve business efficiency and reduce
employee levels. 
The challenge with integrated procurement services, meanwhile,
is inherently low profitability. While integrated procurement service is
effective as the initial entry point in building transaction relationships with
customers, it can wind up just increasing sales and not delivering profits on
its own. After beginning the relationship with an inte­grated procurement
service framework, other aspects must be added, such as proposals to revise
specifications, switching to parts and materials that are more profitable, and
expanding transactions to other parts and materials.
These
measures should be pursued after obtaining strong customer satisfaction through
reliable provision of initial integrated procurement services. Elematec has
been largely succeeding in realization of this type of positive spiral (even if
not in every case). We think it is important for Elematec to solidify a pattern
of enhancing profitability in integrated procurement services in light of
significant latent outsourcing demand.


(2)
Processing services 
Elematec is a trading company and adheres to a stance of
avoiding competition with manufacturers, who are transaction counterparts.
However, customers (sales destinations) often request delivery of processed
items. Elematec has its own processing sites to accommodate these needs – one in Japan and two in China. 
In Japan, Elematec Logi Serve Corporation (based in Yokohama)
processes and manufactures electric materials and other products, conducts
acceptance inspections, and handles environment-related material measurements.
In China, Elematec Electronics (Dalian) Co., Ltd. implements surface mounting
of parts into electronic circuit boards and Elematec Wuxi Technology Co., Ltd.
handles silk-screen printing, for plastic panels, cutting and processing, and
assembly. 
Elematec starts generating added value and increasing
profitability once it gets to the point of supplying custom­ized products that
it has planned and designed utilizing new product development information and
information about the latest technology trends and other developments that it
possesses. This is what Elematec refers to as “modularization.” Its promotion of modularization often
overlaps with promotion of planning and development functions explained below.
If planning and development functions work well and deals are arranged,
modularization business naturally occurs. 
Elematec does not limit itself to manufacturing and processing
at only its own processing sites in modularization business. However, it is
beneficial to outsource from a position of directly having processing and
manufacturing technologies. We will be looking for Elematec to accumulate
experiences and technologies in processing services and apply them to module
processing at its own plants.
(3)
Planning and development functions 
Planning and development business begins with appropriate
understanding of customer needs. Fundamental flow in this business involves
Elematec identifying optimal parts and materials from its roughly 6,000
domestic and overseas suppliers to meet wide-ranging needs at customers for
electronics, mechatronics, exteriors, design, and other aspects or planning
products that satisfy requirements (even creating product prototypes in some cases)
and submitting proposals to customers. 
Two essential ingredients in this business are “grasping” and “realizing” needs. Not many rival companies have
both of these capabilities, and we believe this function is another source of
differentiation for Elematec versus other companies. Additionally, adoption of
new products based on Elematec’s plans and designs means that it becomes an only-one presence
to the customer firm. We think this is a very effective way of strengthening
relationships with customers. As explained above, these new products should
generate high profitability due to Elematec’s role of processing into modules for
delivery.


The
three services described above are similar in their provision of “differentiation,” as services and functions that cannot be
easily achieved by other companies in the same industry, and “customer retention,” by securing trust from customers through
the process and positioning Elematec as a vital presence to customers. We
believe the diversity of transaction partners and products in Elematec’s business enables it to deliver these
functions and services. These broad transaction relationships naturally put
Elematec into contact with the latest products and technologies. Elematec
leverages knowledge obtained from its activities, together with planning and
proposal capabilities as a technology trading company, to cultivate new
relationships and offer new products. We think Elematec’s primary strength resides in its
establishment of this “beneficial
cycle.”


◆Results trends 
Sales
and profits weakened in FY3/17, though posted second highest net sales and
third highest operating income
1. Review of FY3/17 results 
Elematec reported weaker sales
and profits in FY3/17 at ¥203,004mn
in net sales (-6.4% YoY), ¥5,406mn
in operating income (-21.3%), ¥5,314mn
in ordinary income (-22.8%), and ¥1,342mn
in profit attributable owners of parent (-73.4%). (However, consolidation of 15
months for some subsidiaries in FY3/16 exaggerated sales and profit decline
rates.) 
Elematec lowered FY3/17 forecast at the 2Q announcement, and
operating income and other profit items exceeded the revised values in FY3/17.
While sales and profits weakened, Elematec posted second highest net sales and
third highest operating income. We think it turned in a solid performance,
despite pressure from steep decline in mainstay smartphone-related sales over
the past few years.


Net sales dropped ¥13,820mn YoY in FY3/17. We give a
detailed explanation of decline factors below. However, the largest setback by
demand segment came from the roughly ¥30,000mn
YoY decline in smartphone-related sales. Overall sales decline totaled ¥13,820mn (as noted above), even with this
downturn in smartphone business and suspension of the Company’s sales to building materials, thanks to
expansion of surface-mounting business (for LCD parts) to the ¥20,000mn range. 
In earnings, meanwhile,
surface-mounting business gains were not enough to fully offset profits lost
from steep decline in smartphone-related sales. This is because of low profit
margin in surface-mounting business that is similar to integrated procurement
service. Gross margin fell 0.2pp from FY3/16’s 8.6% to 8.4% due to lower sales plus
less favorable product mix. 
In SG&A expenses,
personnel costs declined due to a drop in bonus payments that are linked to
earnings, but transportation costs moved upward on expansion of
surface-mounting business and other expenses increased from booking provisions
to the bad credit allowance. SG&A expenses narrowed by ¥173mn YoY, though the ratio of SG&A
expenses to sales climbed by 0.3pp from 5.5% to 5.8%. Given these results,
operating income slipped ¥1,462mn
(21.3%) YoY to ¥5,406mn and operating income
margin contracted 0.5pp to 2.7%. 
The
larger decline in profit attributable owners of parent, meanwhile, stemmed from
booking ¥2,801mn in extraor­dinary
losses, including a provision of ¥2,787mn
to the bad credit allowance. Elematec booked reserves for the full value of
credits to a building materials counterpart in China. It already ended activity
with this company and took a one-time loss in FY3/17.
Sales
dropped mainly on declines in smartphone-related sales and building materials
business in China; automotive business continues to expand at a healthy pace
2. Trends by individual markets 
Elematec discloses sales by three market segments – Digital Electronics, Automotive, and
Broad Market.


Digital Electronics sales rose
¥1,197mn YoY in FY3/17.
Smartphones are the final product market for LCDs, touch panels (TPs), and
backlights (BLs) sold under this segment. This area posted a sales gain of ¥8,445mn due to a roughly ¥20,000mn lift from mounting business. Its
sales hence were down by about ¥11,500mn
on a real basis. Mobile terminal, which also refer to smartphone business,
encountered a setback of ¥10,728mn.
Industrial equipment under the Broad Market segment recorded sales related to
smartphones (vibration motor parts and materials) as well in FY3/17. These
three areas worked out to a decline in smartphone-related sales of roughly ¥30,000mn, weighing heavily on Elematec’s income. For other areas, sales improved
by ¥1,635mn in toys and hobbies
and ¥3,526mn in TVs and monitors. 
Automotive sales climbed ¥395mn YoY in its only sub-segment of
automotive-related business. The real gain, which excludes the impact of
15-month consolidation in the previous year, was ¥1,276mn. This result confirms healthy
growth. 
Broad
Market sales fell sharply by ¥15,414mn
YoY. While aftermarket sales increased ¥2,690mn, industrial machinery sales were
off by ¥8,007mn and housing sales
declined by ¥9,072mn. Industrial machinery
business faced a decline in sales of smartphone vibration motors, as noted
above. House building weakness reflected the drop in transactions for building
materials in China, which were the cause of the extraordinary loss.
◆Medium to long-term growth strategy 
Formulated the new slogan – “elematec x (cross)” 
1. Overview of the
medium to long-term strategy 
Elematec does not prepare
medium-term business plans with a fixed period, but it formulates basic
policies for initiatives related to a medium to long-term strategy and proceeds
with business on this basis. 
It updated the internal slogan
in FY3/18, switching from “elematec
+ (plus)” to “elematec x (cross).” “Cross” means combining things to create
synergies and accelerate business. It also refers to “agility” for emphasis on timely action. 
The new slogan presents four visions. We are primarily
interested in Vision 3 “Innovation: Planning and developing important technologies” and Vision 4 “Global: Realizing support on par with
domestic operations worldwide (including emerging markets).” While more details are given below, we
think the growth strategy in “elematec x (cross)” can be readily understood with the two key words of “globalization” and “modularization.”


As
longer-term its numerical goals, Elematec discloses a two-year forward outlook
along with forecast for the fiscal year at the start of each year. This is a
rolling-type medium-term plan. Elematec presented a FY3/20 forecast for ¥250,000mn in sales and ¥8,000mn in ordinary income this time.
While these are the same goals given for FY3/19 from a year ago, we think it
restated the ¥250,000mn in sales because it
is an important threshold value.

Pursuing
direct accounts with overseas final customers to avoid the impact of weakening
at Japanese manufacturers
2. Globalization: Initiatives with global direct accounts 
Globalization is one of the
two vital measures being promoted under “elematec x (cross).” This means promotion of global direct
accounts. In past overseas business, Elematec mainly supplied electronic
materials and other parts and materials to Japanese devices and electronic
parts manufacturers and sold parts and materials produced by these companies to
overseas assemblers and final product manufacturers. This approach limited
direct transactions with overseas companies. In the new initiative, meanwhile,
Elematec wants to establish its own accounts with overseas final product
manufacturers and conduct transactions directly. 
An important backdrop of its decision to pursue establishment of
global direct accounts is relative decline in the standing of Japanese
electronics companies, which are Elematec’s direct customers. Using smartphones
as an example, few manufacturers have businesses with sufficient presence in
not only the global market, but the Japanese market as well. The same can be
said for LCD and OLED panels, a key component. We think concern that continued
reliance just on Japanese manufacturers could ultimately lead to shrinking
business provided the catalyst for Elematec to move forward with full-fledged
globalization.


A
specific action is revision of business style to address regional conditions.
In China, we expect Elematec to primarily target final assemblers of
smartphones, TVs, and other consumer electronics. In this process, Elematec has
raised topics such as recruitment of local suppliers for cost reasons, building
personal ties with top executives in light of business practices, and
localizing management from the standpoint of business practices.
Initiatives
in Asia (ASEAN, Taiwan, Korea, and India) are expanding sales to local
manufacturers in the Digital Electronics segment and automotive market (such as
onboard electronic devices) and localizing management (similar to China). For
the US and Europe, Elematec aims to expand sales channels to non-Japanese
automakers, strengthen support for Japanese automakers, and develop sites to
facilities broader sales coverage.
Proposes
solutions based on its own planning, design, and prototyping to customers with
the aim of increasing added value
3. Modularization: Creating technical solutions and added
value 
The other core initiative in “elematec x (cross)” is creating technical solutions and
added value. This involves the same content as the “planning and development function” explained in the section on the Company’s attributes and strengths. In other
words, it begins with appropriate understanding of customer needs and then
involves Elematec identifying optimal parts and materials from its roughly
6,000 domestic and overseas suppliers to meet wide-ranging needs at customers
for electronics, mechatronics, exteriors, design, and other aspects or
planning, designing, and prototyping products that satisfy requirements and
proposing solutions to customers. 
If customers select proposals
(products) that Elematec has prepared and developed, Elematec delivers
modularized products and can expand earnings from this added value in
comparison to selling electronic materials and other items just as materials.
Understanding customer needs, the first step in this process, needs to take
place at the customer’s development stage that
defines specifications. While Elematec has handled many products adopted at
this early stage, we think it is important to increase this even more. 
Modularization initiatives are useful in building business with
Japanese manufacturers and should also serve as an effective tool in
cultivation of global direct accounts mentioned above. Some examples that have
been well received are decorative processing on the front panel of smartphones,
touch panel and LCD alignment modules, and automotive decorative technology and
plating technology.
Targeting
new technology and demand opportunities in various markets through integration
(modularization) of sensing and communications
4. Growth strategies by market 
Elematec envisions a breakdown for its FY3/20 sales goal of ¥250,000mn of Digital Electronics at ¥142,000mn, Automotive at ¥33,000mn, and Broad Market at ¥75,000mn. These levels require upbeat
growth rates, and Elematec hopes to reach them through “further expansion mainly driven by
module product sales.”


While
Elematec presents strategies for individual markets, “provision of sensing and communications
solutions” is a common strategy in all
markets. This approach aims to secure sales channels in the most basic area for
the IoT and ICT era. It then adds priority items for each of the three markets.
(1)
Strategy for the Digital Electronics market 
Elematec’s assessment of current conditions in the Digital Electronics
market depicts 1) slower growth rates and tougher competition for smartphones,
2) rising demand for IoT-related devices, and 3) growing applications for
OLEDs. Its business priorities are recruiting auto display business, increasing
sales of mobile housings and embedded parts, promoting OLED parts and
materials, and expanding sales of reinforced glass. 
(2)
Strategy for the Automotive market 
In the Automotive market, Elematec sees the two most significant
market changes as growing demand in driving assistance and reinforced
development of connected cars. Its business priorities are expanding sales of
parts and materials used in ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems),
increasing HMI (human machine interface; switches, buttons, handles, and others
items that enables people to operate the machine) and decorative business, and
boosting direct transactions with overseas Tier 1/Tier2 parts manufacturers. 
(3)
Strategy for the Broad Market 
For the Broad Market, Elematec is aware of the need for multiple
overseas production sites in light of market diversity. It also expects growing
demand for sensing devices with IoT advances. Its priorities are strengthening
sales to aftermarket segments, expanding modules for consumer electronics, and
increasing modules for medical and industrial equipment. 
Elematec talks about alliances as a common strategy in pursuit of
these three market. It is pursuing synergies with the TOYOTA TSUSHO Group and
aims to bolster collaboration with new materials and parts manufacturers.
Steadily
expanding products handled and customer volume for the massive display devices
and automotive market
5. Progress in major markets 
(1)
Overall image 
The wide range of suppliers, products, and customers is another
Elematec strength as explained above. However, even this type company (or
perhaps because it has such broad coverage) ends up with growing sales to
products that have large markets or products with extensive related industries.
Current examples are smartphones and automobiles. 
While some observers refer to Elematec as a “company with strength in smartphones” or a “smartphone-related stock,” our view is that it is a “company with strength in display
devices.” LCD panels are the primary type in the
display market at this point and smartphones occupy a large presence as the
application. This is why many of the products handled by Elematec are utilized
in smartphones as the final product. 
OLEDs, a new display device, are currently about to move from
the initial emergence stage to a growth stage. Elematec naturally needs to
clarify its standing in supply of parts and materials to OLEDs as a company
that excels in display devices. 
We think Elematec has two main approaches to the automobile
market. One is expansion of applications and usage volume for display devices
in vehicles. This business comes within the framework of display devices and is
covered by Digital Electronics in Elematec’s disclosure information. The other is
supply of parts and materials besides display devices. Elematec books sales in
this business under the Automotive segment. It aims to achieve growth by
capitalizing on both of these opportunities. 
(2)
Current state of LCD, touch panel, and backlight markets and progress 
The “LCD,
touch panel, and backlight” sub-segment under Digital Electronics in Elematec’s disclosure information covers
products for display devices. While it has many destination (end user) markets,
smartphones are the overwhelmingly largest market followed by onboard and
consumer electronics. 
a)
Smartphone LCD panels 
Elematec faced sharp production adjustments at the start of 4Q
FY3/16, but business recovered from 2Q FY3/17 and continued a healthy recovery
trend in 3-4Q. Business remains upbeat in FY3/18 too. Additionally, increased
sales of high-precision and advanced parts and materials to high-end models in
China lifted earnings in 4Q FY3/17. Elematec expects moderate increases in
sales of parts and materials to Chinese high-end models again in FY3/18. 
b) Onboard
LCD panels 
Car navigation systems were the primary onboard LCD panel in
past years, but the emergence of vehicles without side mirrors is likely to
contribute to expansion in the volume and size of LCD panels and other display
devices mainly around the driver’s seat over the medium term. Provision of visibility is a key
driver for onboard panels. Elematec has anti-reflection technology cultivated
for smartphones and hopes to utilize these capabilities to expand business
opportunities. Onboard LCD panels experience a much tougher usage environment
than smartphone panels. Elematec intends to utilize its knowhow and technology
to sell optimal display parts and materials (molded parts, glass, etc.),
backlight films, and other items.
c)
Response to OLEDs 
Usage of OLEDs in smartphone displays is likely to ramp up in
FY3/18. Elematec has been making proposals for OLED parts and materials and is
delivering products to a Japanese OLED firm. However, this has not advanced as
a specific business yet because the OELD firm is still in the prototype phase. 
OLEDs and LCD panels have overlapping applications so are
competing and can replace each other. While this is often interpreted as a
disadvantage for Elematec because its OLED business has not started yet, the
replacement of LCDs with OLEDs is unlikely to take place suddenly and LCD
panels should continue as the main format for the time being. Nevertheless, the
LCD panel growth rate will be curtailed and Elematec is acting promptly with
responses in light of this trend. 
(3)
Current state of the automotive market and progress 
Main items besides display devices for the automotive market
currently are HMI-related parts and materials, glass, light sources, heat
dissipation sheets, plastic parts, and optical products. Elematec has
accumulated technology and knowhow for glass front side panel processing,
decorative molding, and plating used in smartphones and other products.
Customers highly rate these capabilities, and Elematec utilizes them in
automotive business as well. 
Growth areas in recent years are LED headlamp light-source
assemblies, molding sales, and cables and wire harnesses. In particular, LED
headlamp light sources have emerged as a new business opportunity amid rapid
advances in the shift to LED light sources in recent years and this area
appears to be steadily expanding. Customers are not just Japanese auto
companies. It appears that US and European auto companies are major final
customers, reflecting favorable reactions to Elematec’s global site deployment. 
As explained above, integration of sensing and communications is
the core theme in Elematec’s medium and longer-term strategy. For sensing devices, it is
focusing on IR sensors and other sensors as well as various camera module
products. Camera modules are vital components in vehicles without side mirrors,
ADAS, and driverless vehicles. Elematec is trying to work its way into this
business. It appears to have already started sales initiatives for lens
modules, CMOS sensors, shielding materials and housings, harnesses, and other
parts and materials to multiple leading automotive parts manufacturers jointly
with customers. 
For communications, the other aspect, Elematec plans to
strengthen its proposals for communications equipment modules. While it
currently handles milliwave radar materials (heat discharge materials and
shielding materials) in this general category, Elematec envisions communications
equipment with modules that contain communications and sensing devices
cultivated in the smartphone business. We will be waiting for advances in this
business.
◆Business outlook 
Targeting
higher sales and profits as growth in automotive sales offset decline in
LCD-related sales
Elematec guides for ¥205,000mn in net sales (+1.0% YoY), ¥5,800mn in operating income (+7.3%), ¥5,600mn in ordinary profit (+5.4%), and ¥3,900mn in profit attributable owners of
parent (+190.5%) in FY3/18. 
The
large growth rate in profit attributable owners of parent stems from
non-recurrence of the extraordinary loss booked in FY3/17. Elematec manages its
budget on a full-year basis and does not prepare 1H forecast.


The low sales growth rate at
just 1.0% YoY takes into account exhaustion of mounting business, forex
assumption impact (it uses ¥105/USD
versus FY3/17’s ¥108.34), and anticipated impact from some
customers switching from LCDs to OLEDs. 
Elematec expects a 0.1pp rise
in operating margin based on decreased demand of low-margin mounting business
and sales replacement by products with average margin. 
We
think the projections of sales declines in LCDs, touch panels, and backlights
and mobile handsets under Digital Electronics, reflecting the impact of the
switch to OLEDs, stands out in the outlook for major markets. Conversely,
Elematec forecasts a large ¥4,372mn
(23.8%) YoY rise in Automotive sales thanks to the start of car models that
contains its products from design specifications prepared a few years earlier.


We
think Elematec’s guidance and assumptions are
convincing. However, the earnings outlook seems conservative in light of strong
sales momentum from 4Q FY3/17 continuing in 1Q FY3/18 and the current forex
rate that puts the yen at a cheaper level than the plan’s assumption. While it is still too early
to discuss the possibility of an upward revision at the 1Q announcement, it is
worth thinking about Elematec’s
forex sensitivity (a single year of depreciation versus the USD adds ¥1.5bn to sales and ¥50mn to ordinary profit for the year).






◆Shareholder return policy 
Basic
policy targets dividend payout of at least 30%, expecting a large dividend hike
in FY3/18 that reflects profit recovery
Elematec primarily pays
dividends as its shareholder return policy and aims to keep the dividend payout
ratio at 30% or above while taking into account the earnings outlook
(short-term and medium term), growth investments, cash flow, and other factors.

When Elematec lowered the
FY3/17 forecast during FY3/17, it also reduced the full-year dividend target
from ¥65 at period-start (¥30 interim, ¥35 period-end) to ¥20 (¥10 each for interim and period-end
dividends). It announced the FY3/17 dividend as ¥20 in line with the revised view. The
dividend payout was 30.5%. 
For
FY3/18, Elematec presented a ¥58
dividend target (¥25 interim, ¥33 period-end) that reflects the
anticipated steep increase in net income attributable to parent shareholders.
Dividend payout based on the ¥190.49
EPS estimate works out to 30.4%. We think the dividend could vary again this
year depending on the earnings trend because the initial estimated payout ratio
is very close to the 30% basic policy.
