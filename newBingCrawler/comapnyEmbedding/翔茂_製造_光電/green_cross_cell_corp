YONGIN, South Korea, April 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Green Cross, a South Korean biopharmaceutical company, today announced plans to build a new cell therapy manufacturing facility at the Guian New Area in the Guizhou province of China. The new manufacturing site sets to address the cellular therapeutic industry's demand for clinical studies and commercial supply. 
Green Cross has a robust and growing portfolio of approved and clinical stage cell therapy projects including T cell, NK cell, dendritic cell and stem cells. Cell therapy products are an increasingly significant tool in the treatment of serious diseases. 
"Our investment reflects the strength of our business and the increasingly important role that cell therapy will play in Green Cross' future," said Dr. BG Rhee, President of Green Cross Holdings.

The report shows that China's pharmaceutical market has grown at a rapid 21% compound annual rate over the years. In a recent forecast, China's pharmaceutical market is projected to continue to grow at around 17% annually and likely to become the second-largest pharmaceutical market by 2020.
