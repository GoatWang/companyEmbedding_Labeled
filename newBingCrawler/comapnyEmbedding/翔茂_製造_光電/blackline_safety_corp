G7x wireless gas detection and lone worker monitoring system for remote employees


 

G7x plus Single-gas and Quad-gas cartridges with ‘LEL’ sensor approved for use in hazardous locations
Blackline Safety Corp.





CALGARY, Alberta, July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blackline Safety (TSX VENTURE:BLN) ("Blackline"), has achieved all required certifications for its new G7x wireless gas detection and lone worker monitoring system for remote employees. Blackline’s complete G7 product line is fully-certified and shipping globally. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f40ca63e-6e98-49f1-ac23-0ece01d8a94f All electronic equipment used in hazardous locations must be certified intrinsically safe to prevent a potential for atmospheric explosion due to the presence of combustible gases or vapors. Additionally, the North American marketplace requires a performance certification for gas detection equipment fitted with a combustible gas sensor. The full G7 family now carries these certifications and can be used by workers in all hazardous environments. “Our new G7x employee-worn, satellite-connected safety device is now the latest G7 safety product to meet these high standards,” said Cody Slater, CEO and Chairman at Blackline Safety. “Our full G7 product family is now bringing state-of-the-art emergency response management to industries and work scenarios where every second counts. Wireless safety monitoring empowers every business to put their teams first and act in real-time, to make the difference between rescue and recovery.” G7x is a highly customizable gas detection instrument that empowers the fastest possible emergency response — directly to an employee’s location, however remote they are. Featuring internal location technology and automatic incident detection capabilities, G7x alerts live monitoring personnel when an employee requires help. G7x is the only quad gas instrument with satellite communications and two-way messaging to the employee, connecting a live monitoring team with a worker in need of assistance. Two-way messaging allows monitoring personnel to assess the situation and deploy an emergency response as required. In remote locations, co-workers are often the first responders and can be dispatched to the employee’s exact location and are notified to prepare for any atmospheric hazards such as a gas leak. G7x is the only wireless gas detector to feature a series of field-replaceable cartridges, tailoring operation for environmental gas detection, lone worker monitoring and evacuation management scenarios. Single-gas and Quad-gas cartridges support a lower explosive limit (LEL) sensor to detect combustible gases. Industries where personnel enter confined spaces often leverage a quad-gas instrument with combustible gas, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2) sensors. As a two-part solution, G7x works in conjunction with Blackline’s G7 Bridge portable satellite base station to deliver true last-mile safety monitoring of remote personnel. The G7 Bridge base station manages a satellite uplink to the Blackline Safety Network, facilitating safety monitoring of field personnel through a cloud-hosted portal. An industrial-quality radio link connects up to five G7x devices to one G7 Bridge and delivers a real-world open range of two kilometers. This 900 MHz radio link enables monitored employees to confidently move from driving a vehicle to working throughout complex facilities without interruption. G7x has achieved certification for its LEL sensor construction, performance and test according to CSA C22.2 NO. 152-M1984 (R2016) Combustible Gas Detection Instruments and ANSI/ISA-S12.13: 2000 Performance Requirements for Combustible Gas Detectors. G7x is also certified intrinsically safe in North America with a Class I, Division 1, Groups A, B, C and D rating and according to IEXEx Ex ia IIC T4 Ga.
