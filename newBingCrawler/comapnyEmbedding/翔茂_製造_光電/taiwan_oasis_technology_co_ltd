Welcome To The Oasis
Founded in the year 1974, for more than 30 years, Taiwan Oasis has thrived from originally a mold development and plastic injection shop, to now a multi-factory with a diverse portfolio covering PCB, plastic injection parts, advanced optical parts, and full line LED packaged components. Today, Taiwan Oasis has become equipped with a broad spectrum of competence consolidating practically all aspects of LED technology, as the one among manufacturers with the highest degree of vertical integration in the industry.
Well diversified yet strategically deployed, Taiwan Oasis vertically incorporates all sectors of LED value chain: from the upstream dice and wafer, PCB and plastic parts in the middle, design and tooling, all the way to the down stream packaging and assembly process for LED products, with product offering that comprises of:
　1. 7 Segments (numeric) and 14 Segments (alphanumeric)
2. Customized LED Display Components
3. Through hole LED Lamps
4. SMD LED
5. Super Flux LED (Piranha)
6. Assembly LED Lighting Products
Agility And Velocity
The strategy of vertical integration is meant to facilitate “mass-customization”, to provide our customers unique advantages of:
　1. Fit from the first time precision, by the integral engineering;
2. Quick response to various customer demands and design changes;
3. Agile reflex to the market situation, and;
4. Ultimate quality control with the minimal parties involved, and;
5. The utmost cost efficiency by the minimal layers from factory to the field.
Certified Quality
Certified by both ISO 9002 and ISO/TS16949, daily production outputs from the factory’s automated lines are sampled and subjected to a series of grueling life tests in our own in-house lab, covering:
　1. Vibration test,
2. High temperature / high humidity climate test,
3. Thermal shocking / thermal cycling test, 
4. Die-and-Wire Shear test
5. Encapsulation material TG test
6. Re-flow and solderability test
7.Aging, and burn-in tests (per customers’ requirement and specified criteria);to ensure their
reliability profile exceeds the highest industrial standard.
