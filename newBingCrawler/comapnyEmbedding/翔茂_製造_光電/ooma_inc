History[edit]
Ooma was founded by Andrew Frame, who previously worked for Cisco Systems, in 2004.[4][5] Ooma's initial product was a "VoIP in a box" device which used peer-to-peer VoIP technology to let users make phone calls over other Ooma users' landline services.[6][7] The system works through a "hub" which connects to the main phone line as well as "scouts" which connect to additional phones.[8] In January 2008, Ooma terminated the use of peer-to-peer technology.[9]
PC Magazine awarded Ooma the DigitalLife Best of Show award in the hardware innovator category for the Ooma Hub in 2007.[10] Frame stepped down from his role as CEO in 2009 while hiring his replacement, Eric Stang.[11] That same year, Ooma released its Telo system, which consisted of a base system to access unlimited calling and caller ID.[12] In 2009, Ooma was awarded an Internet Telephony product of the year award for its development of Ooma Telo and the Ooma Telo handset.[13] That same year, Ooma was given the TMC Labs Innovation Award for the Ooma Hub and Ooma Scout.[14] Ooma received the gold consumer product of the year award as part of the Best in Biz Awards in 2011.[15]
In 2011, it was announced that Ooma's VoIP-In-A-Box was expanding to Canada.[16][17]
Ooma unveiled its HD2 handset in November 2012. The handset includes one-touch voicemail, an intercom, and baby monitoring features. Ooma also launched Ooma Linx in 2012 which used an AC outlet to connect any phone or fax machine to the Telo base station.[18] In December 2012, Ooma received the Internet Telephony Product of the Year award for its development of the Telo, HD2 handset and Linx.[19]
Ooma worked with West Valley City, Utah, in June 2014 to offer free telephone service to households through a fiber network.[20] In 2015, Ooma was named one of the fastest growing private companies by San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal.[21] That same year, it was a gold winner of the Best of Biz Awards.[22]
Funding[edit]
The company's initial funding round raised $7.8 million in 2005. In 2006, Sean Parker invested in the company. Ooma held a Series B funding round in 2007 which raised $12 million. Investors included Worldview Technology Partners and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[23] In September 2008, Ooma raised $16 million in its Series C funding round.[24]
Ooma raised a $18.3 million Series D funding round in June 2009. The round was led by Worldview Technology Partners.[11][25]
In January 2012, Ooma raised a funding round of $17.3 million from investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Founder's Fund. The company had raised a total of $83.3 million at that time.[26]
Ooma held its IPO in July 2015. The company went public at $13 per share. Ooma raised $85 million from the 5 million shares offered.[1][5]
Operations[edit]
Ooma's service offerings are broken down into two business models: Ooma Telo for personal or home use and Ooma Office for businesses.
Ooma Telo[edit]
Ooma Telo was released on October 1, 2009. Telo is designed to provide unlimited, free VoIP calls within the United States and features Bluetooth integration, and HD voice. A cordless DECT 6.0 handset was also released.[27] Ooma allows customers with existing landline, cable- or DSL-based VoIP service, or mobile service to port their number to Ooma, provided their number is available and able to be ported.[28]
With the premier package, users get Multi-Ring, Do Not Disturb, and enhanced voicemail. Users will also receive Caller ID with Name, which was removed from the basic package following the release of the Ooma Telo. Ooma Premier offers access to Google Voice extensions for customers with Google Voice accounts (Ooma Telo only).[29]
Ooma Basic customers are charged monthly taxes and regulatory recovery fees (which vary by location), and get unlimited calling within the U.S., low-cost international calling, free Ooma-to-Ooma calling, basic voicemail, basic caller ID, call waiting, and E911 service.[30]
Ooma Office[edit]
Launched in 2013, Ooma Office consists of a cloud-based phone system including business applications such as conferencing, virtual fax extensions and extension dialing.[31] In August 2016, the mobile version of Ooma Office was released. The mobile version does not require the base station unit Ooma Office operates through. Features available through the mobile software include a virtual receptionist, call transferring, local and toll-free numbers, conference bridges, and extension dialing. In 2016, the Ooma Office Partner Program was released.[32][33]

We couldn’t possibly make it any clearer.Internet congestion is the enemy of voice quality. Hear for yourself how our competitor holds-up under 30% data loss. Then hear Ooma call quality under the same conditions. Ooma PureVoice™ HD technology delivers superior voice quality even under extreme conditions using a collection of advanced technologies only Ooma can provide.

Here’s how the magic happens:
Advanced Voice CompressionOoma uses an advanced voice compression algorithm that reduces bandwidth by 60% over standard VoIP technology. This leaves you with more bandwidth for all your other online activities.Wire-speed QoSAlthough Ooma uses a mere fraction of the bandwidth of standard VoIP technology, the bandwidth it does use must be an absolute priority. Ooma prioritizes voice packets without slowing down the rest of your network so you can enjoy crystal-clear calls even while uploading video clips.Encrypted callsOoma takes your privacy seriously. We use the same encryption technology governments use to protect classified data (which makes Ooma more secure than your old landline).Adaptive RedundancyPacket loss causes phone calls to sound stuttered or garbled with standard VoIP technology. Our sophisticated algorithms detect packet loss on your Internet connection before you even hear it and automatically deploy redundant packets to boost the clarity of your phone call.HD VoiceOoma HD Voice technology doubles the fidelity of your phone calls by capturing twice the speech information of a standard voice call (yes, that includes your landline.) When you and the other caller use an Ooma handset, or any HD compatible phone, your voice will sound more natural than ever.



Sophisticated technology meets elegant design.
The Ooma Telo is no dumb adapter. It’s actually a small, networked-managed, secure Linux computer packed with processing power to keep your calls clear and reliable.

        What is PureVoice HD?
    

        With PureVoice HD technology Ooma delivers crisp, clear voice quality and fewer dropped calls even when the Internet is busy.
    






                Packet loss causes phone calls to sound stuttered or garbled. Ooma’s Adaptive Redundancy detects packet loss and automatically sends redundant packets for better sounding phone calls and fewer dropped calls.
            



                Ooma HD Voice technology doubles the fidelity of your phone calls. When you and the other caller use an Ooma handset or mobile app your voice sounds more natural.
            



                Ooma uses an advanced voice compression algorithm that reduces bandwidth consumption by 60 percent over standard VoIP technology.
            



                Ooma prioritizes voice packets without slowing down the rest of your network so you can enjoy crystal-clear calls even while viewing online video.
            



                Ooma takes your privacy seriously. We use the same encryption technology governments use to protect classified data (which makes Ooma even safer than your old landline).

There was significant static and the service was low for what I was paying. I switched to Comcast for $33 a month for VOIP service through their HFC network as part of a Triple Play. For this I received basic service and free unlimited U.S. calling. Although the service with Comcast was good, we found that the cost for a phone in the home was not a necessity since everyone now has cell phones. Since this was no longer a must have, I looked for something that was low cost but would still provide traditional land line service for the FAX, business calls, etc.Research: I looked at several options, including cutting the cord completely. Vonage was pushing a lot of ads at the time, but to me the cost was still too high at $13 a month. Magic Jack was advertised on television, but it did not appear to be the right solution for the home since I wanted to hard-wire into my home phone network, and the Magic Jack required a computer to be on at all times. A friend recommended Ooma. He had a unit for several years and was happy, so I took a look at the service. I found that the service offering compared well to Comcast, and when the unit went on sale, I decided to give it a try.Out of the Box: Everything was packaged neatly and the unit arrived in perfect condition. The instructions for set-up were clear and concise. The unit is similar in size to a wireless router, without the antennas of course.Installation: The unit has an Ethernet pass-through that allowed the unit to be wired between the modem and my wireless router. Although Ooma considers this the optimal configuration, I did not like the set-up and used the sub-optimal set -up of connecting it to my routers Ethernet port as a stand-alone device. Comcast had been kind enough to disconnect my Verizon external connection for their installation, so I connected the twisted-pair phone connector with the Ooma so that I could have the Ooma supply phone service to all of the phone jacks in the house. (NOTE - This is easy to do if you are switching from a twisted pair external feed. Many websites describe how to do this and it is fairly easy). You then have to talk to the Ooma device on a computer with a IP address. This causes the Ooma to bring up an internal web server to set-up your service. The set-up was guided and required no technical expertise.Phone Numbers: Although I live in a rural area outside a small city, I could select the area code I desired and found one that was local for my neighbors to call me. That said, I did like the idea that I could select an area code other than my own, such as the one near my parents. They also offer a phone number porting for a reasonable extra fee, a fee that is waived if you try their upgraded service for a year. Since cost was my driver, I decided to remain on the normal service with a number I chose from a short list of options. Another post expressed dissatisfaction with the area codes available, but this was not my experience.Start-up: This was a little frustrating and the unit took some time to link with the service and download the updated firmware. At one point I thought it was not working. Patience will be the watch word for this part of the set-up. Normally I would deduct a star for this, but the overall cost and experience more than made up for this initial frustration. Once this was completed, the Ooma linked within a minute. Since installation, we have had power or internet failures that caused the phone system to restart. Normally it re-syncs within a minute or so of power returning. That said, on occasion, I have had to recycle power after a loss of internet service or power to force a sync. This has been rare, two to three times in two years, but it has occurred. To me this is a minor frustration and I again would normally take a star, or at least a half, but when I compare this the service and savings, I have to give them the star back.Phone Service Quality: We are on a 20MBS down, 4MBS up service through the Cable Company. My children play online games and we stream a lot of movies from various services. In two years, we have never seen a loss in quality of the call and the sound and reception is as good as Verizon or Comcast, maybe even better. In fact, I am on a conference call on the Ooma for work as I am writing this on the web and my teenager is playing an online game on the PS4. The bandwidth for the voice call is a very small tax on your service and for me has been unnoticeable.FAX: We do FAX over our Ooma line with a All-in-One Printer and have had no issues sending or receiving.Features: I think the level of features you get for FREE are outstanding. The services are comparable to Comcast and I was surprised that you could get so much for, well, nothing but taxes.911: Ooma provides for 911 service to your local police, fire, and medical based on the address you say the box is at.Roll-over if service is out: Ooma rolls over the calls to our cell phones if the power or internet is out. Well thought through!Cost: Free is not free, except here. Once you pay for the unit, you will only pay local taxes. This is not Ooma's fault, you can blame your local government. Actual cost for my service is $3 a month. For me, the pay off was in four months. Since then, the Ooma Telco is printing money for me instead of the Cable or Phone Companies!Two Year Experience: As of April 2014, the box has performed well and I have had no quality issues or failures. I will update the post if it fails in the future, but my expectation is that I will get several more years of service from the Teleo. To date, I have saved over $600 (Yes, after subtracting the cost of the unit. Taxes were paid under both services, but that savings includes the $3 a month for taxes). If you have your Cable modem, you can avoid the $8 a month rent on that as well.Four Year Experience: As of April 2016, we continue to use the Ooma box with no quality issues or failures. The family has long since forgotten that I installed a Ooma box in the basement. For us it is working well. I guess I am around $1300 in savings to date. We are getting ready to sell our house and our Ooma will come with us. I will likely have to pay to have the number changed and i will let you know how it goes.Summary: Yes, this is legitimate and yes it works. You will save money and get the same service as you get from the Telcos and Cable Companies. You will have to be patient on the set-up if your unit needs a firmware update and you might have to recycle power to the unit after a power outage if the resync to the service does not work (for the record, I had to the same thing with the Cable service as well, and a lot more times! So many times in fact that the power plug eventually wore out - but I digress). The features are excellent and you can't beat the cost. I have had the service two years, one month as of this post and I am very pleased that I did this.Recommendation: I recommend this to friends on a regular basis. Many are worried about the VOIP, but once I explain to them it is the same they are getting from the Cable Companies or Verizon Fios, some of the concern drops away. Once it is up and working, they are very happy with the purchase.Read more5150+ comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWorking so far...and expect it to pay for itself soonByCryptapocalypseon May 3, 2014Color: Black|Style: Ooma Telo Free|Verified PurchaseAfter I decided to buy my own cable modem (without telephony) instead of renting one from Comcast, I lost the ability to use VOIP with Comcast, so had to find an alternative.  Following the recommendation of a family member, I bought this unit and set it up.  So far it has worked very well.  The instructions are quite good. It seemed to have a bit of trouble getting an IP address from my router initially, but within 10 minutes after I cycled the unit, the logo turned solid blue on the top and the phone worked fine.  I am opting for basic ooma service, so I had to pay $40 to port my landline number from Comcast, but it was worth it to me versus keeping the free number I selected through the ooma website.  The website indicates that the transfer will take 3-4 weeks, which is lengthy for something that should be simple by now, but maybe that estimate is way on the cautious side- time will tell.Some considerations:-If you want transfer your phone number, don't disconnect your phone service with the current provider until after the transfer occurs.  If you cancel phone service with your current provider, you will not be able to transfer your number- it's out of your control and back in the number pool of your current provider.-ooma won't work with an Ackerman security system, so keep in mind you might have to go with a cell phone-based upgrade to your security system.  It's much safer anyway, but it does decrease the monthly savings when switching to ooma.  The cell service option will cost $10/month more, but I am still money ahead.Cost comparison:+$10.00 for cell phone upgrade to security system+$  3.85 for monthly ooma taxes and fees-$  7.00, no more monthly comcast modem rental charges-$  32.00, no more Comcast phone serviceNet savings is about $25 per month; I spent $160 on the ooma and $150 on Netgear modem plus $40 on the port ($350), so I will break even in about 14 months.  That's OK with me, and worth it to break away from having to use a substandard Comcast modem while getting an upgrade to our security system at the same time.Update- as soon as the phone number ported to Ooma, Comcast automatically raised my monthly subscription rate to internet and cable to $200, so I had to call them and go through the process of getting the monthly rate down.  Comcast subscribers- be prepared.AUGUST 25 2014 update- No problems with the phone except when I continually lost my internet connection.  Off topic, but we just switched to ATT Uverse service and at least in my locale the internet stability has been much better (no drops whatsoever in more than a week).  The final straw was when I was charged $60 for a Comcast service visit when the tech could not find anything wrong with the signal strength, so he informed me he had to indicate that my equipment was to blame.  I didn't understand that meant a $60 charge.  I know other people have the exact opposite experience, but if you are dissatisfied with your current Comcast service, it's worth a look at ATT Uverse.OCTOBER 2014 update.  Ooma box has worked flawlessly, but discovered that the company automatically signs you up for a higher tier of features that you get free for a month, but then your credit card begins to be charged at a higher rate.  Just be aware that you will have to call and stop higher tier service if you don't want those features.MAY 2015: I haven't had any problems with the unit except very rare internet connection drops.  BTW, it took me 6 months to get the $90 Comcast owed me back from them- after three calls and hours on the phone, plus a FAX to their "Consumer Service VP" or whatever their title is, I finally got the check.  I have to say that Comcast's very poor customer service reputation is well deserved in my personal experience.Read more2828 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsI Love Ooma! Here's why:ByJillyJuneon January 5, 2015Color: Black|Style: Ooma Telo Free|Verified PurchaseI've been using my Ooma service for a couple weeks now. I am SO PLEASED with this device. Here's why:1.  The only cost I pay monthly is $3 for government taxes required to use 911 emergency services. I have no problem with that!2.  The call quality is excellent.3.  You get caller ID, call waiting, and voicemail all for free.4.  The device itself looks pretty slick.5.  You get to choose from a list of available local phone numbers (I think you can even use your current number instead, if you prefer).6.  Came in secure packaging with easy to follow instructions.7. The lighted design on the top lets you know at a glance if your service is connected by shining an electric blue color. The small "play" button lights up orange when you have voicemail so you can easily see if you have new messages.I've tried several other VoIP's including Vonage (which is good, but costs $10-$25/month while Ooma is ONLY $3/month), and a few other apps on my iPad mini that let me make/receive calls in my iPad when I'm connected to the Internet (Talkatone, Google Voice, Voxofon, and WeTalk). For me, Ooma is the most convenient, because it works with any regular corded OR cordless house phone. So happy with my Ooma!Read more

VoIP Phones from Amazon.comGet your business connected with VoIP phones, which place and transmit telephone calls over an IP network instead of traditional phone networks. From 3-line phones to VoIP adapters, handsets, and conference stations, Amazon.com features a large variety of VoIP phones for use at home, in schools, and offices. Dedicated VoIP phones make business calls easy, while conference stations connect several lines for larger meetings and interviews.Great for businesses of all sizes, VoIP phones can be simple software-based softphones or purpose-built hardware for communication. With many different styles, options, and features available, you can simply filter our selection of phones by keywords, brands, customer rating, certification, and price to easily narrow down the choices. From basic handsets to high-resolution displays, functions, wireless abilities, and Internet connectivity, find the perfect VoIP phones set for your wallet, needs, and preferences. Available individually or in sets, save time and money by connecting with others over IP calls instead of investing in a telephone hardline or mobile plan.We also carry a variety of other VoIP equipment for your convenience. Adapters and routers bridge regular home phones for easy calls over the existing IP. Handsets are similar to corded phones, but provide a wireless and sometimes hands-free calling experience. A popular choice for many homes, VoiP phones and equipment help you save money by using your Internet and IP networks instead of traditional networks. With featured brands like Cisco, Polycom, and Ooma available online, you can shop from the comfort of your own home. Many items are also eligible for Free Shipping options, which allow you to save more. Invest in a new way of calling with VoiP phones from Amazon.com, your one-stop electronics shop.
