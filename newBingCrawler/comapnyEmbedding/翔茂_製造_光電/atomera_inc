Oxygen Layer May Extend Moore's LawIn CMOS, boosting performance sans-scaling

LAKE WALES, Fla. — Moore's Law could be extended again sans scaling, according to Robert Mears. Mears invented the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) — the first commercial and still popular method of amplifying optical signals without having to convert them into electrical signals (and back again). Now Mears believes he has invented an equally industry-changing technology for CMOS called the Mears Silicon Technology (MST) at Atomera Inc. (Los Gatos, Calif., originally Nanovis LLC).

"At Atomera our vision was how to structure silicon so it had electrical properties that would allow it to work with other types of materials. It was created in computer simulations, then realized on wafers," Mears told EE Times. "Our whole purpose at first was to boost electron- and hole-mobility simultaneously, but then we discovered all these other advantages that went along with it."

MST epitaxy inserts oxygen sub-monolayers between the transistor channel's crystalline lattice layers as they grow (see figure). Mears claims that the result not only enhances carrier mobility, but also provided higher drive current and lower leakage current (by as much as 50%). The oxygen does not bond with the channel material making an insulating oxide, but rather acts as a superlattice that invokes quantum confinement principles to enhance performance. The performance improvements can also be traded-off for smaller chip area (at the same performance) but lower cost, as well as reduced supply voltage for a power reduction (at the same performance).
"The MST process is an epitaxial grown silicon step put down during silicon deposition using standard equipment," Mears told us. "During growth we stop at periodic interval and put down a monolayer of oxygen creating a very subtle disturbance in the silicon lattice for conditional confinement that squeezes that conduction region ending up reducing the scattering of electron and holes."

Claimed performance enhancements Mears' team discovered also include improved reliability and reduced variability (for higher yields and better transistor matching, respectively) due to a "more ordered, steeper retrograde well/channel profile for better channel doping".
The amount of performance enhancement depends on many factors, according to chief executive officer (CEO), President and Board Director, Scott Bibaud, but "ranges between 10-and-25 percent." The good news, is that MST can be applied at any node — from legacy 180 nanometer nodes to mainstream 28 nanometer nodes to the most advanced 10-to-7 nanometer nodes. For instance, Atomera published a paper on next-generation SRAMs in the April 2016 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices titled Analysis of 7/8-nm Bulk-Si FinFET Technologies for 6T-SRAM Scaling. There they stated that "using a MST punch-through stop layer facilitates reductions in SRAM minimum operating voltages by ~15% and area savings of ~20% in the SRAM cell.
"We make a technology that adds to the CMOS process mobility enhancements plus many other side benefits, including higher performance, lower power consumption, better yields and lower costs," Bibaud told EE Times. "Use our technology to increase performance by the same amount as going to the next design node —  rather than continuing to shrink. With MST we believe that 28 nanometer will be the most popular node for the next decade, because only very large dies make it worth the move to 22 nanometer."
Mears invented MST just after the turn of the 21st century and has been hard at work with his team at Atomera ever since perfecting the technique and proving the concept for microprocessors, DRAMs, SRAMs, flash, other memory technologies, power-management chips, radio-frequency (RF), analog and mixed‐signal devices. The company's business plan is to license its technology — which is protected by 55 U.S. Patents and over 150 International Patents — to every major semiconductor maker. After all, all fab owners want more bang-for-their-buck and Atomera promises to deliver it.

The company went going public at this time because they have three legacy node makers of analog and mixed signal chips, which Atomera anticipates will allow their names to be used as licensees by 2017 (also pushing Atomera to go public on Nasdaq as ATMR).
"There are three ways MST can solve Moore's Law," Bibaud told us. "For legacy nodes for analog and power devices, such as 180-, 130- and 90-nanometer, they can shrink their die size while getting the same performance. At 65-, 40- and 28-nanometer MST can give a new level of performance and lower power at the same node, allowing fabs to be productive longer. And at very advanced node like 16-, 14- and 10-nanometers, FinFETs using MST will allow fabs to continue using bulk silicon rather than going to other materials like III-V channels."
Atomera is keeping its hand close-to-its-vest on its future growth opportunities — besides saying that it hopes to work its way up from legacy silicon nodes to popular- and then advanced-nodes. However, it claims to have even higher goals in sight. For instance, Mears photonics-amplifier fame has gotten his mental gears turning on how to enhance optical and solar devices with MST. And according to Bibaud the company also has improvements of magnetic materials for next-generation advanced memories in sight.
So far, however, the company is only revealing how standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabs can easily integrate MST into the conductive channel of their transistors. One paradox, however, is that on the one hand it emphasizes how easy it is to "merely" modify a fab's epitaxial layer design. On the other hand, it claims their adopters will also need consulting services to to optimize the oxygen superlattice layer for particular applications.
One thing is for sure, Atomera needs that revenue stream to get it out of the red since mass production could be years away. The company recently went public as ATMR and now has to answer to stockholders. Accordingly it is hoping to cash in on licensing and consulting for the $350 billion semiconductor market, prompting Nasdaq to allow Bibaud to ring the exchange opening bell on August 18, 2016.
On the positive side, Atomera says their cost-per-wafer is lower than alternative CMOS enhancement techniques that extend the lifetime of a fab's infrastructure including "stress memorization, embedded-SiGe, Dual Stress Liner, SOI [silicon on insulator], and HKMG [high-k metal gate]."
On the negative side, Atomera claims to have taken their technology to most big fabs, but have only convinced three legacy fabs to sign-on. And what is even more curious, claims to have never briefed any analysts I could interview to get an unbiased evaluation of MST.
For more information read Atomera's many free online papers.

There is something missing from this description.  Oxygen at standard temperature and pressure is a gas.  It doesn't bond to any solid.

Clever idea as far as transport. They must be exploiting the ability to control the sub-band structure with extremely thin thickness, thereby optimizing mobility.
But it requires extremely good control of the layer thickness. It seems it might even require control at the atomisitic level.
Can fabs actually control these thicknesses that well?

The cash flow statement is one of the reports a publicly traded company like ATOMERA INC needs to disclose.  While its important to look at the ATOMERA INC debt position, the cash flow statement becomes equally important because public companies use accrual accounting.  For example, if a company sells a product which gets counted as ATOMERA INC revenue  but does not convert to cash because it does not receive payment in the same quarter, it affects the cash position for that period.  This statement can tell if a company is running out of money while still being profitable and is useful in ATOMERA INC stock analysis.  ATOMERA INC had a negative net income cash flow of $-12.61M for the latest year.  This report is very useful in measuring the short term viability of a company.  The cash from operating activities for ATOMERA INC is $-6.79M for 2016, which saw a decrease of 55.02% from previous year.

KLA-Tencor Corp.


                  KLA-Tencor was formed in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments (KLA) and Tencor Instruments (Tencor), two long-time leaders in the semiconductor equipment industry. Prior to the merger, both businesses served a segment of the inspection and metrology area; with KLA focused on defect inspection solutions and Tencor placing its emphasis on metrology solutions. Merging together in a one-to-one stock swap valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor became the most important process control player in the industry, bringing to market a complete line of yield management products and services from a single company.

KLA was named after its founders, Ken Levy and Bob Anderson. The word “Tencor” came about because the founder of Tencor, Karel Urbanek, wanted a two syllable name that would be easy to remember.

KLA Instruments was first established in 1975, with its first product emerging on the market in 1978—an automated inspection system that reduced photomask inspection time from eight hours to 15 minutes. Shortly thereafter, KLA Instruments went public and expanded its inspection product portfolio to include patterned wafer inspection systems. Two years later, KLA further broadened its offerings into the wafer metrology business through optical overlay and line-width measurement systems. During the subsequent few years, the company expanded its product base through the development of software solutions to help integrate inspection and measurement data for analysis—ultimately forming the industry’s first yield management software services group to provide customers with expertise in yield enhancement through engineering consulting services.

1977, Tencor Instruments established its name, and first introduced its yield management product—the Alpha-Step stylus surface profiler—just seven months later. This yield management solution provided significant improvement in step-height measurement, a critical parameter in measuring film layer thickness. In 1984, Tencor Instruments launched its first Surfscan product—a particle and contamination defect system based on laser scanning technology, which soon became the production standard. By the late 1990s, Tencor had broadened its yield management product offerings to also include defect review and data analysis tools. Following an initial public offering in 1993, Tencor then acquired Prometrix, a leading supplier of thin-film measurement solutions, and further expanded its yield management product offering. At the time of its merger with KLA, Tencor had revenues of approximately $403 million and 1,400 employees around the world

After the payment of underwriting discounts of 8.3% on the sale of the shares
offered hereby and estimated offering expenses of $685,000, the net proceeds of
this offering will be approximately $21,323,000. We intend to apply the
estimated net proceeds of the offering as follows:

                                                        Amount      Percent

         Business development, sales and marketing   $  3,326,388     15.6 %
         Research                                    $  1,513,933      7.1 %
         Working Capital                             $  2,665,375     12.5 %
         Total Net Proceeds                          $ 21,323,000      100 %

We intend to apply approximately $13.8 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards development engineering, which will consist primarily of our
further development and qualification of MST® and the evaluation, testing and
engineering involved in the formal product qualification process undertaken by
our potential customers. As our marketing and business development efforts lead
to a significant indication of interest on the part of a potential customer, we
will engage in development engineering for purposes of characterizing our
solution to the goals and needs of the customer, and work with customer to tune
our MST® to their unique production process and equipment.

We intend to apply approximately $3.3 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards business development, marketing and sales. In the initial
stages of our marketing and business development, we expect to spend a
significant amount of time and capital in defining the benefits of MST® for each
target customer, including simulation, modeling, data collection, marketing
costs, market research, partnership development, and business development
efforts.

We intend to apply approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards research spending, including long-term investigation into
additional advanced materials and techniques for our platform, efforts with our
academic and scientific partners, and maintenance of our patent portfolio.

The net proceeds allocated towards working capital will be applied towards our
costs of facilities, information technology, public company related costs,
including accounting and legal, along with normal recurring general and
administrative expenses.

Our estimated use of proceeds is based on our current assumptions and estimates
concerning the costs and timelines of securing one or more IDMs or fabless
semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license MST®technology and start
full-scale industrial production of a device that incorporates our MST®
technology. If our assumptions or estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may
require additional funds in order to carry out the activities described above.
In addition, the expected allocation of net proceeds set forth above represents
our best estimates based upon our present plans and our assumptions regarding
industry conditions and our anticipated future revenues and expenditures. We may
find it necessary to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described
categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes in order to carry out
our business plan if those assumptions change.

If the underwriter exercises its right to purchase additional 480,000 shares of
common stock to cover over-allotments, we may receive up to an additional
$3,301,200, after deducting $298,800 for underwriting discounts. We intend to
apply any net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option to working
capital. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities
such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.


Our lead product, MST®, is a proprietary and patent protected performance
enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering
challenges facing the semiconductor industry. We compete with IDMs, OEMs,
foundries, fabless manufacturers of semiconductors and semiconductor IP
licensing companies, for the development and commercialization of technologies
that improve the performance of semiconductors. Historically, when a new
fabrication process proves to be a low-cost improvement to the standard
fabrication process, and is additive, rather than in place of other performance
technologies, it has been successfully adopted industry-wide. Good examples of
such advances have been strained silicon, such as SiGe. We believe that MST® has
the potential to be one of these low-cost additive technologies, in which case
MST® would not be subject to significant direct competition from other
technologies.


Company Description
We are engaged in the business of developing, commercializing and licensing
proprietary processes and technologies for the $350+ billion semiconductor
industry. Our lead technology, named Mears Silicon Technology™, or MST®, is a
thin film of reengineered silicon, typically 100 to 300 angstroms


 (or
approximately 20 to 60 silicon atomic unit cells) thick. MST® can be applied as
a transistor channel enhancement to CMOS-type transistors, the most widely used
transistor type in the semiconductor industry. MST® is our proprietary and
patent-protected performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a
number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry. We
believe that by incorporating MST®, transistors can be smaller, with increased
speed, reliability and energy efficiency. In addition, since MST® is an additive
and low cost technology, it can be deployed on an industrial scale, with
machines commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing. We believe that MST® can
be widely incorporated into the most common types of semiconductor products,
including analog, logic, optical and memory integrated circuits.

We do not intend to design or manufacture integrated circuits directly. Instead,
we intend to develop and license technologies and processes that will offer the
designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits a low-cost solution to the
industry need for greater performance and lower power consumption.

In the mid-1980s, our founder, Dr. Robert Mears, was part of a team that
re-engineered silica optical fiber to invent the erbium-doped fiber amplifier,
or EDFA, a technology that increased the bandwidth of optical fiber more than
1,000 times. The invention of EDFA helped to revolutionize the development of
broadband and to this day remains a key technology in the optical communications
industry. Dr. Mears anticipated scaling problems for silicon semiconductors and
founded Atomera Incorporated in order to address those problems for the
semiconductor industry.

Over the last ten years, we have undertaken significant laboratory testing and
engaged with a range of semiconductor industry and academic technology leaders
to evaluate MST® performance on test chips in industrial fabrication
environments. We believe this testing has demonstrated that MST®offers
performance benefits beyond and in most cases additive to those provided by
already successful semiconductor performance enhancement technologies, such as
dual stress liners and source/drain channel stressors, such as eSiGe/eSiC, and
can be implemented without significant additional cost or significant
modification to the current semiconductor fabrication process.

We are now in the process of transitioning MST® technology toward commercial
adoption. We are currently in the early stages of process qualification with
leading integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and foundries. The IDMs and
foundries are our intended customers and by way of the process qualification
stage they test and evaluate the potential incorporation of our MST® technology
into the integrated circuits they produce. We are also partnering with
manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication equipment and developers of modeling
tools. These parties are part of a semiconductor infrastructure supporting the
industry with manufacturing capital equipment for transistor production and
transistor process modeling software, and we are in discussions with certain
