^ The term "Cortex-A9 family" used by Actions is similar to the description used by the company for the CPU cores inside the ATM7029, which have been proven to be Cortex-A5 cores. The ARM Cortex-A5 would be more be accurately described as being "Cortex-A7 family", being slower than but otherwise equivalent to the ARM Cortex-A7, rather than being directly related to the higher-performance ARM Cortex-A9.



Adoption[edit]




Close-up of the Ainol Hero 10 II PCB showing the Actions Semiconductor ATM7029 SoC ASIC and the ATC2603A Mixed signal ASIC.


S1 MP3 players use chipsets designed by Actions.
In 2012, Actions Semiconductor produced the ATM7029 which is a quad-core ARM Cortex-A5-based SoC using Vivante Corporations GC1000 GPU.[15] This SoC has been used in the Ainol NOVO10 Hero II tablet and other low end tablets.[16]
For Q2 2014, Actions was reported to be fourth largest supplier of tablet processors to the Chinese market.[17]
Legal cases[edit]
At one point, Actions was sued by Sigmatel with Sigmatel prevailing. The findings were that Actions infringed upon Sigmatel by directly copying the ASICs designed by Sigmatel, once a world leader in the MP3 ASIC market. Sigmatel later was sold to Freescale Semiconductor.
