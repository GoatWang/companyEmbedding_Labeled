Pixelworks Again Chooses Arteris for Network-On-Chip (NoC) Interconnect Fabric IP
by Kurt Shuler, on January 26, 2011


Network-on-Chip (NoC) interconnect IP leader's FlexNoC™ addresses SoC integration and DDR memory utilization for high-end video processing systems-on-chip (SoCs)
SUNNYVALE, California – January 26, 2011 – Arteris Inc., the inventor and leading supplier of network-on-chip based (NoC) interconnect IP solutions, today announced that Pixelworkshas licensed Arteris’ latest FlexNoC network-on-chip interconnect fabric IP and the Arteris memory scheduler for use in Pixelworks’ real-time video processing SoCs.

For the past five years, Arteris has enabled Pixelworks to quickly adapt our products to changing market needs while reducing our product risk and easily achieving timing closure. We are happy to choose Arteris FlexNoC as the interconnect fabric IP and memory scheduler for all our product lines.”
T Chan, Senior Vice President of Engineering, Pixelworks


Pixelworks first licensed Arteris network-on-chip interconnect IP and the Arteris memory scheduler in 2006. In early 2008, Arteris and Pixelworks announced their first product enabled with Arteris NoC interconnect IP. Since then, Pixelworks has used the Arteris NoC interconnect fabric and memory scheduler in multiple products.
The Pixelworks team chose the Arteris FlexNoC interconnect and the Arteris memory scheduler to enable easy integration of third-party SoC IP and to ensure maximum DDR utilization. The easily configurable Arteris scheduler allowed creation of arbitration schemes which suited the needs of various Pixelworks products lines with minimal design and verification overhead, thereby enabling faster time to market and a lower solution cost.
Arteris FlexNoC and the Arteris memory scheduler also alleviated wire routing congestion and timing closure issues with many IP blocks communicating simultaneously with DDR memory. In addition, the Arteris products allowed Pixelworks to easily adapt interconnect topologies to save area and to port to FPGA targets for SoC emulation.
“For the past five years, Arteris has enabled Pixelworks to quickly adapt our products to changing market needs while reducing our product risk and easily achieving timing closure,” said T Chan, Senior Vice President of Engineering for Pixelworks. “We are happy to choose Arteris FlexNoC as the interconnect fabric IP and memory scheduler for all our product lines.”
Use of the Arteris FlexNoC IP simplifies the front-end design process while easing back-end routing congestion and timing closure issues. Arteris NoC interconnect IP technology enables SoC designers to achieve lower power, higher memory bandwidth and optimized latencies by individual connections. This improves SoC performance, lowers SoC costs and enables rapid adoption of IPs communicating in a variety of protocols. The growing Arteris ecosystem provides connectivity to a variety of IPs and IP protocols as well as multiple EDA design flows.
The Arteris FlexNoC product offers ability to reduce the number of interconnect wires required for SoC design. Reducing the number of wires resolves routing congestion at the back-end place-and-route stage, resulting in shorter development cycle time, less SoC complexity, smaller SoC area and less SoC power.
“Pixelworks’ purchase of Arteris’ latest FlexNoC network-on-chip IP and memory scheduler products after using the previous versions for nearly five years is a strong vote of confidence in Arteris’ demonstrated capability to deliver exceptional value to customers,” said K. Charles Janac, President and CEO of Arteris. “We are proud that Pixelworks has once again entrusted Arteris with resolving the SoC challenges of fast IP integration, timing closure, and risk reduction.”

Pixelworks: A Buy Ahead Of Apple Product Announcements - Pixelworks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PXLW) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pixelworks: A Buy Ahead Of Apple Product AnnouncementsSep. 9.14 | About: Pixelworks, Inc. (PXLW) RightEdge Analytics Deep Value, special situations, momentum, research analystSummaryDue to its current Apple revenue stream, Pixelworks may be mentioned in Apple's upcoming product release as the producer of an integral component in one of its new devices.The Iris chip is a ground breaking component bringing high definition to mobile and is going into mass production.Pixelworks is undervalued relative to peers and should be trading at about $17 per share prior to the upcoming Apple announcement.A $50 million shelf registration has been filed and could be used for a huge product ramp up for a client like Apple.Background:
Pixelworks Inc. (NASDAQ:PXLW) designs and produces semiconductors for digital video display in mobile devices, televisions and projectors. Pixelworks' varying product lines show great diversity and promise for a small cap company. Their large contracts with industry leading clientele show that they are building exceptional demand in the marketplace.
Iris-Bringing HD to mobile devices:
Pixelworks has developed the first high definition video processor for mobile applications. This device can be implemented in devices such as smartphones, tablets, and ultrabooks. The Iris chip will deliver superior performance to all current offerings. The Iris chip is able to offload the CPU and GPU to free up system resources and conserve battery life. According to testing, the Pixelworks chip could save as much as 44% of power usage. Pixelworks has said that Iris has been sampled by customers since June and may already be in mass production.

The Apple Connection
News first came out on March 3, 2014 in the 10-K that over 10% of PXLW's revenues came from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). On August 8, 2014 in the company's most recent 10-Q, it was disclosed that Apple accounted for 14% of Pixelworks' revenues. There are many different applications that would be advantageous for both players. At the current time, it is unknown why Pixelworks is receiving this revenue from Apple.

New board member with deep connections to Apple
On April 4, 2014, Pixelworks brought David Tupman on to the board of directors. Tupman was a vice president in Apple's hardware engineering division prior to becoming the CEO at Details Lab Inc. Tupman led the hardware and technology teams for both the iPhone and the iPod until 2011. We believe that this connection will facilitate a long-term relationship between Apple and Pixelworks.
What will Pixelworks do for Apple?

Source: appleinsider.com
We see three different ways that Pixelworks could integrate with future Apple products. All three of these hypotheses will improve Apple's current line and provide immeasurable revenue growth for Pixelworks. While none of these conjectures have been announced, these are the three viable reasons for the revenue that Pixelworks is receiving from Apple:
Iris video processor in iPhone and/or iPad
Iris would integrate perfectly with Apple's soon to be announced iPhone 6 and iPad. It only stands to reason that being a market leader, Apple would be the first to offer high definition video viewing on their mobile devices. We also firmly believe that if the Iris chip goes into one of these devices, it will go in both. The development timeline of the Iris chip also seems to match up well with the release of these devices.
Pixelworks is building out the Apple TV
Since the rumors of Apple TV began to circulate Pixelworks has generated 14% of their revenue from Apple. This would explain the developmental stages of this new product using PXLW processors. In the conference call from the last earnings report on July 31, 2014, the CEO Bruce Walicek telegraphs that they have developed a mass production version of large screen for a partner (Apple):


"For projected and panel large screen display applications we continued to ship volume production of the PA168 during the quarter, which includes our patented halo free technology, and tackles the most demanding video quality problems in monitors and Ultra-HD TVs, and during the quarter we began shipping the mass production version of the advanced SOC for large screen applications we developed under our co-development partnership. This is a significant milestone on this project and we expect to ramp production in the second half of 2014 and beyond."

Pixelworks is building a projector for the iPhone 6
It has been rumored that the iPhone 6 will have a projection device feature. With Pixelworks' expertise in both mobile processors and projection displays, they are a logical producer of this device. This device could be an option or an additional feature to the iPhone so its impact will not be known until it is released.

$50 Million shelf registration
On August 29, 2014, PXLW filed a Form S-3 for a $50 million shelf registration. We see this as both a risk and an opportunity. The primary risk involved with this registration is that it gives PXLW the ability to dilute the shares if they chose to. However, based on a current financial analysis of PXLW, we do not see the need for them to dilute unless there is an extremely large order in the pipeline. The dilution may lead to a decline in share price. On the contrary, we feel that the dilution will not come without some large announcement that would greatly counteract this dilution to the upside. We believe that this shelf registration is pointing to a direct ramp up of a large order from Apple.

Peer Analysis
We feel that PXLW is currently undervalued against it peers. Even without a large event from Apple on Tuesday PXLW is trading at a discount. QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ:QUIK) is the most comparable company in the industry to PXLW. QUIK is of similar market cap as PXLW and designs and builds semiconductors for tablets and smartphones. Based on multiple metrics, QUIK is trading at an unjustified premium to PXLW.

Source: RightEdge Analytics
Based on our valuation and growth measures, we believe that PXLW is worth about $17 per share as it stands. These estimates are based on Pixelworks' current business without factoring in the large Apple event we expect to take place in the coming days.

Source: RightEdge Analytics
Conclusion
At its current share price, Pixelworks is trading at a great discount. Before factoring in any potential Apple relationships, PXLW has a price target of $17 per share. Because we feel that the Apple-Pixelworks relationship is in the early stages, Pixelworks has an unlimited upside. Pixelworks is a stock to buy ahead of Apple's product release on September 9th.

Recent NewsPixelworks to Acquire ViXS SystemsCombines Visual Display Processing and Comprehensive End-to-End Video Delivery To Create Industry Leader of High-Quality Video Streaming SolutionsSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 18, 2017-- Pixelworks, Inc. (NASDAQ: PXLW), a leading provider of visual processing solutions and Toronto-based ViXS Systems Inc. (TSX: VXS), a pioneer in media processing, encoding and transcoding solutions, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Pixelworks will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of ViXS in an all-stock transaction consisting of approximately 3.7 million shares of Pixelworks common stock valued at approximately US$20.2 million. At the effective closing date, each share of ViXS will be exchanged for 0.04836 of a share of Pixelworks’ common stock. The exchange ratio is equivalent to consideration of US$0.26 per ViXS common share, based on the closing price of Pixelworks on May 17, 2017. Based on a 60-day trailing average stock price for Pixelworks of US$4.65 per share and C$0.21 (US$0.15) per share for ViXS, the transaction represents a premium of approximately 47.7%.Complete Press ReleaseHigh Resolution Displays and Moving ImagesIs higher resolution needed to convey true realism in video displays?This white paper analyzes how moving images are perceived by the viewer and why motion images require a higher resolution than static images to ensure artifacts caused by display’s pixelated nature don’t impair the realism effect.
