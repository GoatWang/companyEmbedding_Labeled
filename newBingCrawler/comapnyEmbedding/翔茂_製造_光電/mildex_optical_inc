Custom Touch Screens
95% of our Business is CUSTOMIZATION.
Customization is recommed for volumes +1000 units to optimize Price / Performance
Customization results in an own customer Product Number (PN) that assures LONGIVITY.
Only customization realizes Products with specific performance, dimensions, specification.
Especially for INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, MIL applications a customized solutions assures compliance to fit, form, function including long-term-supply contracts (5 - 10 years).
Any Product, that requires a printed front surface (PCAP, TouchWindows) will be a customization.
The wrong perception that only a "Standard Product" assures application security has lead a number of customers to unhappy experiences, like failing performacne, EOL, sudden, unexpected change of std. product specs, etc.
Customization secures (!) your Product / Application / Program and leads to success.
