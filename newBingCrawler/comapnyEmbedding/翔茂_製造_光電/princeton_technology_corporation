 1.Medium/Low Power LED Lighting Driver IC SeriesPTC Launches Medium/Low Power LED Lighting Driver IC SeriesHigh-performance driver ICs provide competitive advantages in terms of efficiency, size, reliability, and lifetime for LED bulb manufacturers.Erosion in LED lighting product pricing has become a trend that has been matched by growth in the LED lighting market size.  However, further cost reductions in the LED die and thermal-structural-optical system are limited.  Hence, lighting driver IC pricing has become the key factor to enable LED bulb manufacturers to control their cost.  Energy standards in Europe and the U.S. (Energy Star EVP5) have been clearly defined.  Mandatory requirements are that residential lighting drive power factor (PF) must be greater than 0.7 and commercial lighting PF must be greater than 0.9.  PTC provides a high quality-to-price ratio linear driver IC solution, the PT6923A, to satisfy the needs of LED bulb manufacturers for a low cost and high efficiency driver IC.High-performance driver ICs provide competitive advantages in terms of efficiency, size, reliability, and lifetime for LED bulb manufacturers.  The PT6923A is a Linear Constant Current Controller IC for LED bulb, LED tube lamp, and compact-sized LED lighting applications. Its proprietary 3-segment driving topology improves power factor, THDI, and efficiency and increases PF value to 0.9 or higher.  The PT6923A/B includes an integrated temperature compensation function that effectively eliminates the flickering problem for abnormal temperature environments.  EMI issues are solved through proprietary technology activated during segment switching.  Few external components are required enabling flexibility in many compact size applications.In addition to linear driver ICs, PTC also provides several Switching Mode Power Supply solutions.  The PT6979 is a non-isolated Switching Mode Power Supply IC and its green energy technology, the Single-Stage PFC structure, contributes to high PF value (PF < 0.9) and low harmonics (THDI = 15%), which meet the requirements of IEC63000-3-2.  The PT6979 has outstanding line regulation and load regulation and provides several protection functions for AC-DC LED lighting applications.If you need further product information, please visit our LED Lighting Driver IC website.About PTCPTC has accumulated more than 20 years of experience in the design of analog and digital ICs.

 10.Low Power Consumption UHF OOK/ASK Super-Heterodyne Receiver and TransmitterNew IC Designs - Low Power Consumption UHF OOK/ASK Super-Heterodyne Receiver and TransmitterPTC will launch PT4317 (low power consumption UHF OOK/ASK super-heterodyne receiver), PT4452
(low voltage UHF OOK/ASK/FSK transmitter), and PT4455
(low voltage UHF OOK/ASK transmitter).

The PT4317 is an enhanced version of the PT4316 UHF receiver IC.  The original PT4316 relied a SAW resonator to form the local oscillator and can operate over the frequency range from 250MHz to 500MHz while requiring few external components.  The new PT4317 offers significant improvements.  The PT4317 reduces the IF bandwidth to 600KHz, which helps to increase interferer immunity as well as improve receiver sensitivity.  The PT4317 LO spur level is also reduced, enabling easier compliance to RF leakage standards.  In addition, the PT4317 turn-on time is reduced, making the PT4317 well-suited for customers who require low latency power-saving mode operation.    The PT4452/PT4455 transmitter ICs both utilize a crystal oscillator-based PLL topology in order to achieve the lowest frequency offset.  In the 250MHz to 450MHz frequency band, the PT4452/PT4455 can achieve +10dBm output power using a 3.0V supply voltage.  The PT4452
/PT4455 also require the fewest external components to implement a fully-functional UHF transmitter compared with other competitors on the market, helping to reduce the size of the PCB real estate required.
