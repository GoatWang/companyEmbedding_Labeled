Holtek Semiconductor is a Taiwan-based semiconductor design centre and provider. Along with its headquarters and design operations based in the Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan, Holtek operates worldwide with a wide range of global agents. Holtek's design focus is in both 32-bit and 8-bit microcontroller development with the company having around 650 employees.[when?] Holtek also designs and provides peripheral semiconductor products such as remote control, telecommunication, power management, computer peripheral, and memory devices. Holtek's device application area is concentrated in the consumer product field such as household appliances, computer peripheral products, remote controllers, leisure products, medical equipment as well as industrial controllers. Holtek microcontrollers are in home appliances including brands such as Philips, Siemens, Märklin and Japanese brands such as Futaba and Sony.
History[edit]
Holtek Semiconductor was established as a design house in Taipei in 1983. From the design of remote control, telecom and voice/music devices, the company moved into microcontroller design. In 1988 the company moved to the Hsinchu Science Park under the name of Holtek Microelectronics and began also its combined manufacturing and design operations. In 1998 Holtek Semiconductor Inc. became a pure design house with its device manufacturing contracted out. The decision to move out of manufacturing and focus on only design reflected many similar companies.
Products[edit]




Holtek HT48R06A-1


Holtek's design focus is in the area of microcontroller development. Holtek's 32-bit series are based around an ARM Cortex-M0+ and Cortex-M3 cores, and it is producing some 8051 based cores, but the majority of its 8-bit microcontrollers are based on its own self-designed core that is very similar to the Microchip PIC16 architecture. All have common features such as timers, external interrupts, power-down functions, low-voltage reset, bi-directional I/O pins etc. The range of microcontrollers support clock speeds from 32 kHz up to 20 MHz. Device specific features include functions such as EEPROM memory, A/D converters, LCD interfaces, USB interfaces, operational amplifiers. Some of Holtek's 8-bit microcontroller devices:

HT32F51XX ARM M3 core based 32-bit series
HT85F22XX 8051 core based 8-bit series
HT46RXX A/D type series
HT46FXX Flash A/D type series
HT48RXX I/O type series
HT48FXX Flash I/O type series
HT49XX LCD type series
HT56RXX Tiny Power A/D type series
HT66FXX Flash A/D type series
HT68FXX Flash I/O type series
HT82XX Computer Peripheral series
HT95XX Telecom Peripheral series
BS8XXX Touch IC series

Holtek develops other devices, most of which could be classified as microcontroller peripheral devices. One area is that of Low Dropout Regulators where Holtek has provided a range of products with low supply currents. Holtek supports traditional products such as remote control and telecommunication devices. Some peripheral products include:

HT7XX Power Management Devices
HT93X/24X Memory Products
HT12X Remote Control Devices
HT16XX Display Drivers
HT9XX Telecom Peripherals

Holtek Semiconductor devices are used in home appliances, computer peripheral equipment, home medical equipment market. The company also provides a design service for customers with specific microcontroller needs. These special microcontroller devices may integrate functions such as smart card interface or medical analog circuitry within the microcontroller.
Development tools[edit]




Hardware Emulator with Integrated Programmer


Holtek also supplies its IDE-3000 development system to support its microcontroller devices. This is a suite of hardware and software development tools which includes real time hardware emulation and software simulation as well as tools for device programming of OTP and flash type devices. Some of Holtek's ICE In-Circuit Emulators also include an integrated device programmer eliminating the need for separate programming tools. The separate programming tools can be operated in a stand-alone mode without a PC connection.

Holtek microcontrollers are in home appliances including brands such as Philips, Siemens, Märklin and Japanese brands such as Futaba and Sony.
History[edit]
Holtek Semiconductor was established as a design house in Taipei in 1983. From the design of remote control, telecom and voice/music devices, the company moved into microcontroller design. In 1988 the company moved to the Hsinchu Science Park under the name of Holtek Microelectronics and began also its combined manufacturing and design operations. In 1998 Holtek Semiconductor Inc. became a pure design house with its device manufacturing contracted out. The decision to move out of manufacturing and focus on only design reflected many similar companies.
Products[edit]




Holtek HT48R06A-1


Holtek's design focus is in the area of microcontroller development. Holtek's 32-bit series are based around an ARM Cortex-M0+ and Cortex-M3 cores, and it is producing some 8051 based cores, but the majority of its 8-bit microcontrollers are based on its own self-designed core that is very similar to the Microchip PIC16 architecture. All have common features such as timers, external interrupts, power-down functions, low-voltage reset, bi-directional I/O pins etc. The range of microcontrollers support clock speeds from 32 kHz up to 20 MHz. Device specific features include functions such as EEPROM memory, A/D converters, LCD interfaces, USB interfaces, operational amplifiers. Some of Holtek's 8-bit microcontroller devices:

HT32F51XX ARM M3 core based 32-bit series
HT85F22XX 8051 core based 8-bit series
HT46RXX A/D type series
HT46FXX Flash A/D type series
HT48RXX I/O type series
HT48FXX Flash I/O type series
HT49XX LCD type series
HT56RXX Tiny Power A/D type series
HT66FXX Flash A/D type series
HT68FXX Flash I/O type series
HT82XX Computer Peripheral series
HT95XX Telecom Peripheral series
BS8XXX Touch IC series

Holtek develops other devices, most of which could be classified as microcontroller peripheral devices. One area is that of Low Dropout Regulators where Holtek has provided a range of products with low supply currents. Holtek supports traditional products such as remote control and telecommunication devices. Some peripheral products include:

HT7XX Power Management Devices
HT93X/24X Memory Products
HT12X Remote Control Devices
HT16XX Display Drivers
HT9XX Telecom Peripherals

Holtek Semiconductor devices are used in home appliances, computer peripheral equipment, home medical equipment market. The company also provides a design service for customers with specific microcontroller needs. These special microcontroller devices may integrate functions such as smart card interface or medical analog circuitry within the microcontroller.
Development tools[edit]




Hardware Emulator with Integrated Programmer


Holtek also supplies its IDE-3000 development system to support its microcontroller devices. This is a suite of hardware and software development tools which includes real time hardware emulation and software simulation as well as tools for device programming of OTP and flash type devices. Some of Holtek's ICE In-Circuit Emulators also include an integrated device programmer eliminating the need for separate programming tools. The separate programming tools can be operated in a stand-alone mode without a PC connection.
