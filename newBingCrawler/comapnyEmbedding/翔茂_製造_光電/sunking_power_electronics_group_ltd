Introduction


Sun.King Power Electronics Group Limited is an influential supplier and integrator of electric power system solution. Sun.King Power Electronics was established in 2002 and has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since October 2010. Since its establishment, the company has been rapidly growing to become a popular power electronic component supplier and a well-received power equipment and system manufacturer. Sun.King has won a great reputation in quality because we always pursue the best quality and our focus on service and win-win situation with the customers.Sun.King is focused on embracing the three major challenges of the power supply industry: High efficiency, integration and safety. We are dedicated to providing equipment for high-voltage power transmission as well as railway transportation, and industrial enterprises. The Group owns 8 subsidiaries, which are located at Beijing, Jiashan, Wuxi, Jiujiang and Wuhan.In the railway transportation equipment sector, the IGBT power modules and busbar products designed and manufactured by us have been applied to electric locomotives and high-speed transportation systems, and our major customers include CSR and CNR, the two major railway transportation groups in China.In the power transmission equipment sector, the Group, the only anode saturable reactor provider with self-developed technology in China, continuously benefit from the national policies of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) in developing the construction of ultra high-voltage direct current (the “HVDC”) power transmission. In addition, the Group has won several bids in the centralised tender projects for the supply of high-voltage power capacitors designed and produced by the Group to State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid Company Limited.The Group had been actively penetrating the flexible direct current power transmission market, and it has won the bid in the flexible direct current power transmission (the “HVDC Light” or “Flexible HVDC”)  projects of Zhoushan, Xiamen and YuE.In the industrial sector, the Group has maintained stable development for its products used for the industrial sector including high power rectifiers, power quality control device, laminated busbars, and power electronic components, etc.The Group has been actively developing overseas market opportunities. The Group’s high power rectifiers, anode saturable reactors, high power capacitors, laminated busbars, IGBT gate driver units and pulsed powers have been applied in many overseas projects.Looking ahead into the future, the Group is optimistic about the prospects of the market conditions as the PRC government and the local governments have been developing and implementing the power transmission and distribution, and railway transportation investment plans. The Group will adhere to our business concept of “Pursuit of Excellence, Long-Term Win-Win Relationships” and its vison to advance its technology, research and development of new products, operational efficiency, product quality and diversification in order to achieve rapid development.
