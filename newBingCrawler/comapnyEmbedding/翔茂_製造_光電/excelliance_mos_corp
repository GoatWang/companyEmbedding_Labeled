Epistar Corp.

                    In 1996, a handful of visionaries founded Epistar to usher in the LED era, decades before solid state lighting became today’s ubiquitous commodity and highly-anticipated lighting source. First-hand knowledge and insight led the ?edgling Epistar to pursue cutting-edge production and engineering innovation in epitaxy. And with accumulated expertise and expansive capacity, today Epistar sits ?rmly as the premier global supplier. Epistar has already worked with some of the most well-known brands around the world, popularizing LED applications on cell phone screens, laptops, television, and much more. Thus Epistar is able to inject the bene?ts of solid state lighting into everyday life.

The singular vision that has powered Epistar from the beginning also contains insights into client-supplier relationship. Epistar has always believed that, in the tightly-interwoven LED industry, working closely with clients is critical to producing the highest quality end- products. That is why Epistar has developed a unique “Co-Activation Service Model,” working alongside clients as their partner, co-designing chips and production processes, while perfecting quality control. Through such close-knit partnerships, Epistar is able to truthfully gauge the diverse needs of downstream businesses and consumers, and in essence, satisfy every Epistar partner’s client.

Epistar’s pivotal role in LED’s full commercialization has guided the world into the solid state lighting era. Today that era is fast approaching full-bloom, and Epistar is more equipped than ever to take on increasingly challenging feats, to help illuminate the world in a better light.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.
