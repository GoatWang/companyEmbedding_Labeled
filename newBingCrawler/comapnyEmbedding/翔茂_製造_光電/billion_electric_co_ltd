Through monitor the energy consumption data of distantly located street lights and generate these data into performance analytic reports. LCMS can allocate the broken street lights and maintenance service from sitting in the office to minimize labor costs. 
 
This Smart Street Lighting Control System can also calculate the sunrise and sunset times to recommend the suitable luminance level to increase energy savings. By using the broadband power-line communication, LCMS provides large bandwidths that can support the operations of IP cameras, sensors, and other value-added Smart City services.

Key FeaturesThe BiPAC 4400CRL-Q router is a compact and advanced 4G/LTE embedded router running on multiple LTE ban ds including TDD and FDD, delivering ultra-fast 4G/LTE access speeds with peak download rate up to 150Mbps. Featuring superior failover/fallback functionality, the router can automatically fall back to the 3G/2G net work when it gets a poor and unstable 4G LTE environment. Users can watch movies, download music or access e-mail wherever a 4G/LTE connection is available.Integrating with an 802.11n (2.4GHz) access point and a 4-port 10/100 Mbps switch that the port #4 can be c onfigured as WAN/LAN port, the BiPAC 4400CRL-Q delivers a faster wireless speed up to 300Mbps and can flexibly connect to Cable/Fiber/xDSL modem for broadband connectivity. Supporting TR-069, the BiPAC 4400CRL-Q can be easily managed by a centralized device management system (CMS) for configuration and monitoring.
