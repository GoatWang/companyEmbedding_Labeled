This is premised on FY18EPS of 27.0sen against unchanged forward PER multiple of 14.5x.  Maintain BUY. The group has shown positive earnings track record since 1Q14. The positive turnaround provides a clear indication that the revamped business model is able to yield sustainable and satisfactory results. The group is now more focus on achieving better product mix which will translates into higher profit margin. We expect the positive momentum will continue throughout FY17, given the strong demand for its product especially from the automotive and industrial segments.  https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/ptres/40148.jsp  The semiconductor industry has been growing strongly.

Future bright star in making.   http://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/stk/5170.jsp   In Sarawak, mostly government big project goto GRC ( government related company) like Scable and CMSB. That why CMSB share price shoot from rm0.70 til rm4.20 in just few years. As they directly get the project from government and Sub-contract to the small company.   Both GRC is owned by Our Sarawak TYT and his family. U still think got people can beat them down. Sacble could be the second CMSB in future or maybe better than it. EPS dropped as they had spent a lot in hydropwer plant indonesia. But once it completed , it will start to generate profit and lower their expense.    Proxy to Sarawak infrastructure play. Outlook remains steady as mega projects such as Pan Borneo Highway, TRX, MRT2, LRT3, coupled with the implementation of Bekalan Elektrik Luar Bandar (BELB) may spur the demands of cables in the local markets. Furthermore, Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) will be implementing budgeted projects to meet shortage of power supply within Sarawak. Scable expects transmission lines amounting to more than RM500m in value will be rollout by SEB in 2017.   13/06/2017 15:17      wiseinvestor why so much share transferred occur? what its implication?   19/06/2017 18:18      Edwardong53 Any one can share your thoughts on why there is high movement of shareholdings in unisem.
