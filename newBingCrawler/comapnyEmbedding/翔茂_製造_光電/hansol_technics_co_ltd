                    1993년, 삼성은 제2창업 선언과
                    함께 새로운 삼성 로고를 발표
                

                    워드마크의 디자인은 유연성과 단순함을 강조하고 있으며, 우주와 세계 무대를
                    상징하는 타원을 비스듬하게 처리하여, 동적이고 혁신적인 이미지를 나타내고자 했습니다.
                    또 S자와 G자의 터진 부분을 통해 내부와 외부의 기운이 통하게 함으로써 세계와 호흡하고
                    인류사회에 이바지하려는 의지를 담았습니다. 명문 로고 디자인은 기술주의를 통한
                    고객지향 의지, 첨단 기업의 이미지를 현대적인 감각으로 표현한 것입니다.
