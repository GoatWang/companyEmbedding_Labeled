An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: SI5WCB500A is SI5. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, WCB500A, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.

Power is conducted. SAR compliance has been established in the laptop computer(s) configurations with PCMCIA slot configurations as tested in this filing, and can be used in laptop computers with substantially similar physical dimensions, construction, and electrical and RF characteristics. Compliance of this device in all final host configurations is the responsibility of the Grantee. End-users must be provided with specific information required to satisfy RF exposure compliance for all final host devices. The antenna(s) used for this transmitter must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter within a host device. Highest reported SAR is: body 0.42 W/kg.
