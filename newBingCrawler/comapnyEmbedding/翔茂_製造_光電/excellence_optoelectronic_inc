Introduction

Our number one priority is and always has been: product quality. Han Star demands excellence in all aspects of its LED lightbulbs: product moulding, optical lens, heat sink, PCB driver, and most importantly, only brand-name diode chips for each of our lamps. This is why we chose to work with the NKG Group, an international-renown ODM/OEM manufacturer for electronics. All of our LED products are cU/L-approved and comes with a 3-year warranty.


In 2012, our PAR20, PAR30, and PAR38 LED bulbs received ENERGY STARÂ®  certification and Han Star became a proud partner of ENERGY STARÂ® CANADA. Our MR16 (8W), A19, GU10 are currently under consideration for Energy Star certification as well. 
                    

To reduce energy waste and carbon output in the environment, Han Star is constantly promoting energy-efficient lighting in large-scale building units such as condominiums and senior housing. We believe that energy conservation should start with simple acts like switching a light bulb. 
                    

In an effort to better service our LED clients, Han Star Optoelectronic Inc. was established as an official subsidiary of Han Star Co. Ltd. in July of 2012. In the same year, Han Star Optoelectronic Inc. expanded into light fixtures by partnering with one of the biggest light fixture firms in the United States. Our newest line of light fixtures is artistically-pleasing and innovative in design. Its mix-and-match feature is sure to fit each individual lifestyle.

Die & Wafer









Die & Wafer Overview >




In addition to its broad portfolio of packaged semiconductors, Fairchild offers its customers the flexibility of using bare die to improve their designs. Fairchild provides a wide range of products for sale in wafer form, and we partner with world class die houses who specialize in value added processes including sawing, visual inspection to Mil standard, upqualification of die to Military, Space or Medical standards, as well as packing the die in a carrier that suits your needs.
                  














Product Technology









Accupower Load Switches




Need your design to handle higher input voltages while meeting higher efficiency requirements utilizing less board space? Need it done fast? AccuPower� will handle a voltage range up to 36V while maintaining efficiency, and delivering a drop-in integrated solution, requiring less space and less time to design in.
                  






Analog Switches




Fairchild is the premier supplier for switch products for use in portable and consumer applications. Our Analog, Audio, Video and USB switches are used to minimize redundant circuitry, eliminate connectors, allow for design flexibility in feature offerings and to save space in your design. 
                  






Audio Switches




Fairchild's audio switches offer various levels of On Resistance (as low as 0.35ohms), small scale packaging (as small as 1.45mm sqd) and are available in the most common switch configurations. All are designed to minimize THD, leakage current and crosstalk while maximizing ESD and Off Isolation.
                  






BLDC Controller











Bus Switches




Fairchild Switch is a family of low-impedance bus switch, bus exchange, multiplexer/de-multiplexer and analog switches that provide high-speed switching. The low "ON" resistance of these FET switches allow inputs to be connected to outputs without adding propagation delay or generating additional ground bounce noise. Fairchild switches are ideal for high-speed, bidirectional interfaces between mixed-supply buses, and in applications requiring isolation and protection.
                  






Camera Switches




A camera switch portfolio that solves compelling design challenges for designers of 3G smart phones, cell phones, set-top boxes, security cameras and notebooks.
                  






DrMOS




Fairchild Semiconductor's DrMOS, the FDMFxxxx Series, is a complete family of fully optimized, integrated FET plus Driver multi-chip power stage modules designed for multiple synchronous Buck converter applications.
                  






Dual Cool™ Packaging




The Dual Cool package is a top-side cooling PQFN device that incorporates new packaging technology which enables additional power dissipation through the top of the package resulting in more than 60 percent higher power dissipation capability than standard PQFN packaging when a heat sink is mounted.
                  






FHR1200 - Improved Shunt Regulator




The FHR1200 offers greatly expanded specifications versus that of the LM431. This includes: much wider operating temperature and voltage range, and the ability to directly drive a power supply controller unlike the LM431. Finally, the FHR1200 has much lower operating current for those applications where low Standby Power is important.

            One Year Payback with the New Residential LED Street Light from Excellence Optoelectronic
        



            E-lite star™, a registered brand of Excellence Optoelectronics Inc.(EOI) for all outdoor and industrial LED lighting products, has just announced today the new residential LED streetlight SL3c series with the promise of delivering payback in one year and up to 65% in energy savings. The SL3c luminaire has 28 W and 38 W that can replace 70 W to 100 W equivalence of high pressure sodium (HPS) fixtures. Combined with the fact that it only weighs 12 lbs and has an output of 2940~3990 lm., it is now the right time for municipalities, small or big cities, utilities, and private owners to consider switching to LED lighting. 

        






E-lite star™'s new residential street light promises low cost and high energy savings leading to a short payback of one year





E-lite star™'s new residential street light promises low cost and high energy savings leading to a short payback of one year




Low cost, light-weight, efficient, and high in energy savings, the SL3c series only uses the best quality components, driver, optical, materials, and die cast aluminum to deliver a quality finish from top to bottom. “EOI will not replace quality over lowering cost,” says Fanny Huang, the president and CEO of Excellence Optoelectronics Inc. The e-lite star™ roadway lighting products is well known for its thermal technologies that can withstand heat even operating in extreme environmental temperatures such as the ones installed in Arizona. Heat generated must be dissipated to improve reliability and prevent premature failure. It is only with great heat dissipation capability that the luminaire could have a longer lifespan. The new roadway lighting will be display at the IES Street and Area Lighting Conference (SALC) at booth #39 in Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona from September 8-11, 2013. Excellence Opto, Inc., as a manufacturer of solid-state lighting (SSL) energy saving products since 1995, continuously make products based on quality and performance, with a relatively competitive pricing. This new residential SL3c LED lighting will begin its production in the 4th quarter of 2013. Earlier this year, e-lite star™ SL2 LED streetlight, won the Recognized Award from the Next Generation Luminaire (NGL) 2012 outdoor lighting competition hosted by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America and the International Association of Lighting Designers. The SL2 LED roadway has earned its recognition for its performance, quality, tool-less maintenance, and its luminaire efficacy to deliver good quality illumination to roadway. The SL2 streetlights has been installed in several cities in North America.Along with SL3c series, Excellence Opto, Inc. will also be exhibiting new products such as barn and area lighting at the IES Street and Area Lighting Conference (SALC). Besides streetlights, EOI also have other products such as wall packs for security and outdoor applications, and bay lighting for warehouse and gymnasium lighting. Be sure to visit EOI at booth # 39!
