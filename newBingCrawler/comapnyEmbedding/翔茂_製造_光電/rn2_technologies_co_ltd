90 DEG HYBRID COUPLERS
3 dB, 90° hybrid coupler is used to equally split an input signal with a resultant 90° phase shift between output signals. RN2 couplers provide lower 
insertion loss, higher durability of heating and high power voltage.
GO


DIRECTIONAL COUPLERS
Directional Coupler is a passive device that is used for detecting the signal in the system. Depending on the power level being detected, the coupled 
power is usually in the range of 5 to 30dB, which is selected to minimize line loss, as well as couple the correct power. 
GO


ASYMMETRIC COUPLERS
The 90 degree asymmetric coupler is used for unevenly dividing and combining signals and the passive device is made for the asymmetric amplifier system. Depending on the coupling amount, there are 3 kinds of items, such as 1.5dB (2:1), 2.5dB(2:3), 5dB(1:2).
GO


BROAD BAND COUPLERS
Broadband Coupler is device that can be used in a wide bandwidth. There are 2 kinds of products, such as hybrid(3dB), directional(10dB). It is the surface mount which is compatible with Pb free soldering process and available for delivery in tube packages.

RFMW Ltd. and RN2 Technologies Co., Ltd., South Korea have announced a distribution agreement effective May 23, 2017. RN2 Technologies is a manufacturer of Low Temperature, Cofired Ceramic (LTCC) devices such as hybrid and directional couplers, Doherty combiners, SMT terminations, delay lines, RF dividers attenuators, antennas and quadrifilar 4-way couplers. RFMW Ltd. is a specialized distributor providing customers and suppliers with focused distribution of RF and microwave components as well as specialized component-engineering support. Under the agreement, RFMW is franchised to market and sell the RN2 product offering in the Americas.
Hyojong Lee, CEO at RN2 Technologies stated, “We anticipate increased business and growth in the Americas with the help of RFMW’s component engineering, product management and sales capabilities. Their resources, experience, and extensive market knowledge will expand our business over the full range of their customer base.”
According to Steve Takaki, Executive Vice President of RFMW Ltd., “The RN2 product lines are ideally suited to our ongoing focus on RF power products. Transmitter power amplifiers are well served by these devices and RN2 continues to innovate with broadband, hybrid couplers complementary to GaN transistors. Their surface mount delay lines support DPD designs. Teaming with RN2 allows RFMW to offer additional content for existing designs and open doors for new design opportunities.”

Description

3dB Hybrid Coupler
3 dB, 90° hybrid coupler is a four-port device that is used either to equally split an input signal with a resultant 90° phase shift between output signals or to combine two signals while maintaining high isolation between them. RN2 3dB couplers have been designed for wireless application such as signal distribution, power amplifier and low noise amplifiers. By using LTCC (Low Temperature Co-firing Ceramic) technology with leading ledge manufacturing equipments as well as enhanced quality management in place, RN2 couplers provide lower insertion loss, higher durability of heating and high power voltage. RN2 offers a full range of 3dB couplers from 170Mhz to 4,000Mhz applying to T-DMB, NMA, GPS, CDMA, GSM, PCS, DCS, WCDMA, Wibro/ Wimax, S-DMB. RN2 also serves the custom made coupler at high performance and at a low cost according to customer’s special requirements.
They are surface mount compatible with Pb free soldering process and available for delivery in tape & reel or tube packages. The package size are available in six sizes: Q (Quarter), S (Small), M (Medium), D (Delux), B (Big) with power ratings up to 300 watts.

3dB Hybrid Coupler
Directional Coupler is a four-port passive device that is used for sampling either frequency or power. Depending on the power level being sampled, the coupled power is usually in the range of 10 to 30dB, which is selected to minimize line loss, as well as couple the correct power. RN2 directional couplers have been deigned for wireless application such as signal distribution, power amplifier and low noise amplifiers. By using LTCC (Low Temperature Co-firing Ceramic) technology with a leading ledge manufacturing equipments as well as enhanced quality management in place, RN2 couplers provide , lower insertion loss, low VSWR, and high directivity as well as higher durability of heating and high power voltage.
RN2 provides a wide range of directional couplers from 170Mhz to 4,000Mhz applying to T-DMB, NMA, GPS, CDMA, GSM, PCS, DCS, WCDMA, Wibro/ Wimax, S-DMB. RN2 also serve the custom made coupler at high performance and at a low cost according to customer's special requirements.
